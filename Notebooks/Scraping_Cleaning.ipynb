       "'Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Softec Barclays Energy Conference September  4, 2019  7:40 AM ETCompany ParticipantsDarren Woods - Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerConference Call ParticipantsJeanine Wai - Barclays plcJeanine WaiWell, good morning, everyone. It\\'s so nice to see so many faces today, bright and early. Today it is very much our privilege to have Mr. Darren Woods here with us, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil. Born in Wichita, Kansas, Darren Woods is a graduate of Texas A&M University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. He also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Northwestern\\'s Kellogg School of Management.Mr. Woods joined Exxon Mobil International in 1992 as a planning analyst in Florham Park, New Jersey. He progressed through a number of domestic and international assignment for Exxon Company International, Exxon Mobil Chemical Company and Exxon Mobil Refining & Supply Company.In 2005, Mr. Woods was appointed Vice President of Exxon Mobil Chemical Company. In 2008, he was named Exxon Mobil Refining & Supply Company\\'s Director of Refining in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, followed by Vice President of Supply and Transportation in 2010. Mr. Woods was then appointed President of Exxon Mobil Refining and Supply Company and Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corporation in 2012.From here, he progressed to being elected Senior Vice President in 2014 and President of Exxon Mobil Corporation and a member of the board of directors in 2016.Effective January 1, 2017, Mr. Woods became the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which is his current position.Outside of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Woods is the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute and a member of its executive committee. He\\'s also a member of the National Petroleum Council, the Business Roundtable, the Business Council and the Texas A&M University Engineering Advisory Council.So, without further ado, it is my pleasure to turn it over to Mr. Darren Woods. Darren WoodsThank you, Jeanine. Good morning, everyone. Great to be here. I\\'m really pleased to have this opportunity to talk about Exxon Mobil\\'s business. Some of you will recall that, for the first time in 2018, we\\'ve publicly laid out an eight-year plan. And over the past 18 months, we\\'ve tried to keep the investment community updated on our progress. The last update was with Neil Chapman in early August as part of our earnings call. I have to say that I feel real good about the progress we\\'re making. And my sense is that, generally, there\\'s a good understanding of our plans and progress. However, as the world looks to lower their carbon emissions and respond to the risk of climate change, there is a desire to better understand how robust our plans are to evolve in policies and changing market trends. And today, I\\'ll address this and demonstrate how Exxon Mobil\\'s strategy and plans capitalize on the industry fundamentals to grow long-term shareholder value.Of course, we can\\'t begin this discussion without the appropriate cautionary statement. I\\'ll give you some time to read this. Basically, it says we can\\'t predict the future. But I will tell you, it doesn\\'t stop us from trying. Our view of future demand has been reasonably good over time. However, the path to realizing it has been anything but a straight line. It\\'s difficult to predict how the fundamentals of long-term demand will manifest themselves in the short term. There are just way, way too many variables.Which is why we instead focus on building a business that is robust to a range of short-term outcomes that are all consistent with long-term fundamentals. On the supply side, advances in technology play a critical role. These are also very difficult to predict and can lead to a future very different than today. Which is why we put such an emphasis on R&D and in understanding the technology landscape. And I\\'ll talk more about this as we move through the presentation.Let me begin by outlining the topics I\\'ll cover. I\\'m going to focus my comments on energy, but most of my points are also applicable to our chemical business. I\\'ll discuss what drives demand, what determines supply and how we are working to meet demand for both additional energy and lower CO2 emission, while delivering growth in shareholder value. Let\\'s look first at what drives demand. And that begins with people. People trying to improve standards of living for themselves and for their families. Starts with the basics – access to food, water and housing, then moves to light and heat for homes and schools, access to medical treatment, transportation and modern conveniences like refrigeration and air conditioning. This then leads to higher levels of education and income as well as improved living conditions, longer lives and a number of other advantages that frankly we sometimes take for granted.The United Nations has attempted to characterize people\\'s well-being with the Human Development Index. This index measures achievements in three key dimensions. First, gross national income per capita as a proxy for a standard of living. Second, longevity as a proxy for health. And third, years of education.It is encouraging to see the progress made over time in these three areas. On average, the global population is better educated, earning more and living longer. At the same time, it is sobering to see how far some societies have yet to go.The drive to improve living standards will continue, particularly for those less well-off. This in turn will drive the demand for energy. We can use the development index to help with projecting future demand for global energy. This chart links the index for a country shown on the y-axis with its energy consumption shown on the x-axis. The size of the bubble represents the population size. As you can see, there is a clear correlation. As standards rise, so does consumption of energy. This makes sense if you think about the conveniences of modern life.For us here in the United States and much of the Western world, shown in the upper right of the chart, it\\'s difficult to imagine that half the world\\'s population, roughly 4 billion people, have a life expectancy of 10 years less than ours, receive a third less education and one in four don\\'t have access to electricity. In fact, today, about 13% of the global population still don\\'t have access to electricity. This has enormous implications for future energy demand. Let me use China and India as examples. In 1990, both were low on the index and consumed less than 100,000 BTUs of energy per capita. By 2017, the living standards of people in both countries has significantly improved, which also drove a significant increase in energy demand.China\\'s demand tripled and India\\'s nearly doubled. The relationship between societal progress and energy consumption is indisputable. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to modern life. As billions of people strive for better living conditions, the world\\'s need for energy will continue to grow. This relationship is very important and underpins the future of our business. It\\'s fair to ask, though, what form will future energy take. No one can say with absolute certainty. Society wants less carbon emissions, but – to be broadly accepted – sources of new energy must be reliable and affordable. Given today\\'s alternatives, that means technology has a critical role to play.Over 90% of global energy emissions come from three sectors – power generation, transportation and the industrial sector. Today, hydrocarbons meet more than 85% of the energy needs from these sectors. Hydrocarbons are energy dense, they work at scale, are globally available and easily transported which makes them affordable and reliable, and hence the fuel of choice.However, we know that their use contributes to global CO2 emissions, which is driving the need for alternative sources of energy.To successfully compete, though, these alternatives will require similar attributes. Unfortunately, existing alternatives don\\'t consistently provide them. As such, today, they offer only a partial solution. A comprehensive solution will require advances in technology and, in some cases, a breakthrough. Let me illustrate the point, starting with power. Solar and wind offer lower emissions. However, they are limited to areas with enough sun and wind. They require significant land area and are intermittent, with no practical storage solutions that work at scale.Natural gas works at scale, but requires advances in carbon capture to compete on admissions with solar and wind. Additionally, in some markets such as India and China, the cost of natural gas compared to coal is higher.Lithium-ion batteries provide an alternative to fuel light-duty vehicles, albeit with trade-offs on range and refueling times. For heavy-duty vehicles and aviation, existing battery technologies lack the energy density needed.Finally, energy solutions in the industrial sector must be reliable and cost competitive. This substantially limits the use of solar and wind. Similar to power, the industrial sector requires advances in carbon capture to effectively reduce emissions.Now, in pointing these deficiencies out, I\\'m not arguing against the alternatives. I\\'m arguing for additional research and development. Fortunately, there are many organizations doing this, including Exxon Mobil.We are optimistic that these collective efforts will result in advances that address the deficiencies. We don\\'t believe it\\'s a question of if, but when. However, once solutions are developed, time will be needed to fully penetrate the world\\'s global energy system.Let me give you a sense for this on the next chart. Throughout time and across industries, we see the same trend. After initial discovery, technologies can take decades to fully develop and gain widespread adoption. This can be seen in the US as an example. The chart shows the time it took to fully adopt a sample of technologies. Technologies that met an unfilled need with no real switching costs, like the Internet, telephones and personal computers, were adopted relatively quickly, but still took up to 50 years.In other areas, adoption is impacted by available substitutes, perceived benefits, affordability, switching cost and government policies. Wind is a good example. First commercialized for utilities in the 1980s, today it is used by less than 10% of US households. And as you can see, despite the perception, penetration of lithium batteries to transportation remains low even after decades of development.Bottom line, when you think about adoption of new technologies in the context of the global energy system, think in multiples of decades. Society\\'s experience to date illustrates this and you\\'ll see this on the next chart. Oil was first used as an energy source in the 1870s and took roughly 100 years to replace coal as the world\\'s dominant form of energy.And while has been recognized for decades as a carbon-intensive, particulate-laden energy source, it continued to grow until 2013. Today, it makes up 26% of the global energy mix and is expected to maintain a 20% share in 2040. Wind and solar today represent about 1% of the global energy mix and, by 2040, are projected to make up 4%.And despite tis many deficiencies as a fuel and its impact on health, traditional biomass remains an important source of energy in many societies.This chart illustrates a fundamental reality. Energy transitions take a long time. Another fundamental reality seen in the persistent use of biomass is that a society\\'s choice of energy is primarily driven by availability and affordability, which brings us back to the role of technology – to develop a source of energy that is affordable and widely available with lower global emissions.This is where we will make a difference. Exxon Mobil has a deep competency in fundamental science. Extensive R&D capabilities and over 100 years of experience in the global energy business. We are actively investing in the development of lower emissions technologies that have the highest potential for large-scale deployment. We are progressing advanced algae and cellulosic biofuels as potential solution for commercial transportation.Unlike first generation biofuels, these technologies have the potential to provide a renewable source that does not compete with supplies of food or freshwater. Biofuels emit about half as much greenhouse gas as petroleum-derived fuel and have the potential for large-scale production. They also provide the energy density required for planes and trucks.To address power and industrial uses, we are pursuing a number of options to make carbon capture technology more economic. In manufacturing, we\\'re working on new plant configurations, processes and catalysts to reduce energy use and lower emissions. Our efforts include working with a variety of external organizations, pursuing a range of potential solutions. We collaborate across a broad spectrum of science-based organizations in both the public and private sector, including aiding universities around the world, the US national labs, technology venture funds and partnerships with private companies.Our research organization also maintains a broad aperture on external developments, monitoring all relevant advances and discoveries. So, while we can\\'t predict advances in technology, we won\\'t be surprised by them. In the meantime, the world\\'s rising demand for energy must be met. Over the next two decades, the world\\'s population is expected to grow by 20% and the middle class to nearly double. This is expected to result in a 20% increase in global energy demand.In OECD countries, energy demand declines with improved efficiencies. Coal use is expected to shrink, while oil and gas continue to meet the majority demand, with a shift towards gas.India and China account for half of the new global demand, resulting in increases across most energy sources. Let me pause here for a moment because this is important. To successfully reduce global emissions, given their growth, the world needs affordable solutions for India and China. In other words, if we don\\'t solve the problem for India and China, we don\\'t solve the problem.Finally, in Africa, a significant amount of demand is expected to come from biomass, while the demand for oil and gas grows. As you can see, oil and gas will continue to play a critical role in meeting society\\'s needs.This is our view of the long-term fundamentals and it\\'s consistent with independent assessments by both the IEA and the EIA. Our outlook is also in line with the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. This view underpins our strategies and plans.Given its significance, I\\'ll spend a little more time on the industry fundamentals with some additional context. Our outlook projects oil demand to grow at 0.6% a year and gas demand to grow by 1.3%.When you factor in depletion rates, new oil production needs to increase by nearly 8% per year and natural gas by 6%. You can see this when we overlay our demand charts with the depletion charts.The dark blue areas on the chart shows existing supplies that decline over time. The light blue areas show additional supplies needed to meet expected demand.Under any demand scenario, including 2 degree scenarios, shown by the red diamond, depletion in and of itself supports the need for significant industry investments.The IEA estimates that approximately $21 trillion of additional industry investments are needed by 2040. This is a compelling investment case for the industry. Its\\' an even more compelling case for Exxon Mobil. We are creating industry-leading value through unique set of competitive advantages, leading to large-scale businesses with low-cost supply and higher performing products. This allows us to successfully compete across a range of price cycles.I have spoken about these five advantages many times – our technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and world-class people. Each of these advantages are significant in their own right. Taken together, they create unparalleled organizational strength, adaptability and capability. We use them to capture and develop high return, resilient opportunities, leveraging our strong balance sheet across the range of price environments.Good examples of this are the Permian, InterOil and Mozambique acquisitions, all undertaken during the last down cycle. Currently, we have the best portfolio of investment opportunities since Exxon and Mobil merged.Each project in our portfolio is evaluated for advantages relative to competition and against our other opportunities. The returns are stress tested across a range of price scenarios. The chart in the upper left provides a perspective of the value of these projects over time in a range of price environments and the value they bring to our business. While we are happy with the projects we have in our portfolio, we continue to look for additional opportunities. In a depletion business, to sustain the long-term value, you have to. As new opportunities are captured, we have the option to reprioritize capital, putting a priority on investments with the highest NPV.Existing projects in the portfolio have to compete with every new opportunity. This allows us to high-grade our portfolio through selective divestments. It was the primary driver of the $15 billion program we announced earlier this year.The size of this program could grow if continue to capture more attractive opportunities, which is exactly what we\\'re working to do through active exploration and evaluation of potential acquisitions.We feel very good about our opportunity set. We have lots of options and the flexibility to optimize on value and mitigate risk as circumstances change. If there\\'s any sure thing in this business, it\\'s that circumstances will change.We don\\'t need to look any further than the first half of this year to see that play out. Current market conditions highlight the benefits of our strategy and competitive advantages, particularly our scale and the size and strength of our balance sheet.The chart in the top left provides a range of commodity prices and margins over the past 10 years compared to the prices and margins experienced in the first half of 2019.As you can see, all of our businesses are below the median with two at or near historic lows. And while I won\\'t say we predicted this, I can say that we anticipated it. Today\\'s levels are consistent with our historical experience and, importantly, consistent with the scenarios that we used to evaluate our businesses and investments.Even with the extreme weakness in both the downstream and chemicals sectors, the project we recently started up in both these businesses are earnings and cash accretive, demonstrating their advantages.Also want to use the current price environment to highlight the financial strength of our company. The line on the chart at the bottom left shows an estimate of our debt to capital ratio over time, assuming that current market conditions persist through 2025 and the continued execution of our existing plans.As you can see, even in a prolonged, bottom-of-the-cycle margin environment in two of our sectors, we continue to fund our current investments, maintain a reliable and growing dividend and retain the capacity for a sizable acquisition without compromising the financial capacity of the company.Now, while history tells us that bottom-of-cycle conditions like this don\\'t persist for a long time, it\\'s a good test of our businesses, investment portfolio and financial strength. It also gives us the confidence to continue to pursue our advantaged investments.So, with that, let me turn to the investments that underpin our plans to grow value. The status of each of these was shared by Neil Chapman during our recent earnings call. I\\'ll reiterate some of the key points.We have made significant progress on all projects across all of our businesses. The schedules remain consistent with the plans we shared and they continue to look attractive even in current market conditions.Our investment philosophy remains centered on competitiveness rather than price. Each project leverages critical elements of our unique advantages and are expected to grow earnings, cash flow and returns across a wide range of price environments.Let me conclude by summarizing a few key points. Demand for energy is tied to economic activity and people\\'s desire to improve their standards of living. So long as economies grow and people\\'s lives improve, the demand for affordable and reliable energy will remain.Meeting the growing need for energy and addressing the risk of climate change are not mutually exclusive. They represent industry\\'s dual challenge and will require additional solutions and technology breakthroughs. But it\\'s always been this way. As society\\'s needs evolve, so do we. Typically through technology. This is why, over the years, we have been steadfast in our commitment to technology and investments in research and development. We leverage our research to develop new technologies to meet new needs and improve the returns of projects that meet existing needs. Aspects of all of our advantages, technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and people come together to deliver industry-leading projects and, ultimately, growth in shareholder value.All in, where I started today. We have an outstanding portfolio of investment opportunities. We have a solid plan to deliver those investments and feel real good about the progress we\\'re making.With that, I want to thank you for your attention and I\\'ll hand it back to Jeanine for Q&As. Thank you.Question-and-Answer SessionQ - Jeanine WaiThank you so much, Darren, for your comment. Really appreciate it. It was very insightful. So, we\\'re going to spend about the next 20 minutes doing a fireside chat and we\\'ve got a bunch of questions. So, I hope we can get through a lot of them.I think I\\'ll just start off more broadly fundamentally. In your view, do you think the industry is under investing relative to the supply required to meet demand? And if that is your view, when do you think it\\'s going to show up in the oil balances.Darren WoodsWell, we looked at this earlier this year as part of the March analyst and investment. And I mentioned IEA\\'s estimate of the amount of investments needed by the industry through 2040. We looked at allocating that to the existing competitors on a share basis. And, basically, concluded that Exxon Mobil\\'s investment levels were in line with the IEA\\'s estimate. Most of our competitors and peers were investing at levels that were below their historical investment rates and below what will be required based on the IEA estimated. So, we concluded from that that there probably was some underinvestment in the market at the time. With respect to when that kind of manifests itself in the broader markets, I think it\\'s very difficult to tell. We, and I think the industry in general, have struggled to really ever predict exactly how the supply and demand balances will kind of manifest themselves in short term. So, we don\\'t really focus on when we\\'re going to see that. So, instead, we focus on making sure that we\\'re ready for it when it comes. And we think that what we\\'re doing today with our investment profile that, if that impact comes and supply/demand balances open up, and there\\'s a shortage of supply, we\\'ll be in a position to meet a lot of that demand.Jeanine WaiOkay. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there are a number of factors related to the oil price environment. And from our perspective, investors seem to really value flexibility these days, given volatility in oil prices. So, when we look at your portfolio, is there a flexibility to cut back on CapEx if the current market conditions persist? Maybe what would trigger that and where would you cut back first?Darren WoodsI think there\\'s always flexibility to cut back, but there\\'s a level of inefficiency and higher cost that goes with any of that cutback. The short cycle investments, obviously, carry less costs. Although I would say – people talk a lot about the shale and the unconventional plays as being short cycle and, therefore, lot more flexibility which is true, but I would tell you, with the work that we\\'re doing in technology and the work we\\'re doing in terms of getting the organization focused on this manufacturing mode of driving efficiencies and improving, that any short-term disruption in that is going to have an impact on our ability to kind of drive that progress. So, I would tell you that it would be – we would look at reluctantly pulling back on CapEx if we felt like we needed to.But our strategy has always been, and continues to be, to invest in projects that are competitive in a range of price environments. And if you look at what we\\'re doing with our short cycle investments in the unconventional space, that has strong returns even at low oil prices, below $35 a barrel. So, our view would be, with a robust return even at lower prices that we would continue to invest through the cycle because we have the financial capacity to do that and we generate good returns with it.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, you walked into this one. You mentioned short cycle and Permian. So, how do you think about short cycle versus long cycle? We hear a lot of this when people talk about Exxon Mobil and your peers. And so, is short versus long a consideration that you have when evaluating opportunities in your portfolio? And again, back to the flexibility, is the thinking that short cycle investments such as the Permian, is that easier to pull back in CapEx, like you said, but you\\'ve often talked about investing for the future and needing to do longer cycle, major capital projects. So, how are you thinking about short versus long, especially in the current environment?Darren WoodsI would tell you that the primary criteria we use to evaluate investments is on their competitiveness and the ability to generate industry-leading returns. So, all of our investments across the upstream and the short and long cycle, as well as chemical and refining sector, we look at whether or not those investments are advantaged versus the rest of industry.And one dimension that we look at is our cost to supply with respect to the rest of industry. And we insist that the investments that we\\'re making are advantaged versus industry, and on the very left, there\\'s a cost to supply curve. So, as the supply and demand balances fluctuate, and as you see price cycles come off and prices drop, we want to make sure that our investments are positioned on the far left hand side, and so continue to make earnings and cash even in the low parts of the cycle.And we see that today demonstrated in our downstream and chemical business. So, I showed you the charts that kind of depict how challenged those two injuries are right now. If you look at the investments that we made and just brought on, they\\'re all cash positive and earnings positive even in these very low cycle conditions. So, we feel real good about those projects. And we see the same with our investments in the upstream.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, I guess, sticking to the projects that are cash positive, earnings positive, free cash flow, definitely a key topic in energy right now. Can you talk about when you see Exxon Mobil\\'s inflection in free cash flow? And what factors do you think would either pull that forward or enhance it?Darren WoodsThe factors I would tell you would be primarily market-driven. Since we don\\'t try to predict where the margins and prices are going, as those move around, we\\'ll generate more revenue potentially or less and that will move the free cash flow around.And again, what I\\'d come back to, we\\'ve looked at that profile of spend and we\\'ve tested it around a range of environments. And one of the advantages of having a strong balance sheet is to make sure that we are not whipsawing our businesses around with the volatility in the markets. I think that\\'s one of the advantages that the scale that we have brings to this business, and that constancy of purpose of investing in advantaged projects over the long-term, I think, delivers over the medium-term and long-term greater shareholder value than trying to chase the price cycles.And I think you can see that today with kind of the volatility of the marketplace. Imagine trying to run your business, a capital-intensive, long-term investment, with the changes that we\\'re seeing every day in the market out there. I think that would be a very difficult proposition. So, instead, if you\\'re convinced that you can run and be successful at the bottom end of the marketplace, we pay a lot of attention to it and make sure that the dynamics that we\\'re seeing don\\'t change our thinking about some of these fundamentals. But as you heard in the presentation, the way we look at the business is tied to some very basic fundamentals that haven\\'t changed for decades, if not hundreds of years.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, in terms of not trying to whipsaw the program, not chasing price, investing on fundamentals, maybe just a question on capital allocation. So, relative to your peers, you\\'re spending more and you\\'re doing it countercyclically and you\\'re not doing any buybacks right now. So, could you share with us what the first call is on free cash flow, whether it\\'s dividend, buybacks or reinvestment? And kind of what your though process is on all of those?Darren WoodsLet me first just make the point about our level of investment. I think one of the things that isn\\'t always done when people talk about the level we\\'re investing at is normalize it for our size. So, if you look at our investment level compared to the size of our business, we use cash flow from operations as a proxy for size. The level that we\\'re investing at today is pretty consistent with the level that we\\'ve invested at historically, and we think it\\'s what\\'s required to drive and sustain the long-term value of the business. So, we don\\'t think of where we\\'re at today as being necessarily a higher level of spending. Our peers are at lower levels than they\\'ve historically spent at, which comes back to this question that you asked earlier about if industry is under investing.With respect to how we choose to reallocate our capital, I think the first priority for us is investing in projects that are advantaged versus industry, and we\\'ll continue to grow value for the company. The point I made in the presentation, this is a depletion. So, you\\'re on this treadmill. If you\\'re not investing for the future, you\\'re retreating. And that\\'s certainly true in the upstream. And in the chemical business, with the growth market, if you\\'re not investing, you\\'re losing market position.So, from our perspective, to be a long-term viable company, and that\\'s the way we think about it, we have to make sure that we\\'re continuing to invest in attractive and advantaged projects. So, that\\'s the first priority because it will underpin the ability for our company to do anything else going forward in the future.The second priority is we feel like we\\'ve had a commitment to our shareholders to pay a reliable and growing dividend. So, that\\'s pretty high on our priority list. When And then, we want to make sure that we maintain the financial capacity to transact at the bottom of cycle conditions. And so, one of the things that we\\'re constantly stress testing as we look at where we want to take dividends as we look at our capital investment program is do we have the capacity for an acquisition when prices come off and the market is depressed because we think those are where we\\'ll see value opportunities. And so, we maintain a buffer. And that would be the priorities of our capital allocation.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, switching gears, if you don\\'t mind, to the Permian.Darren WoodsSure.Jeanine WaiWe think that there\\'s just a ton of buzz and questions on what we\\'ve called kind of \"major mojo\" in the Permian. So, if you don\\'t mind, why exactly is your development plan in the Permian unique? And what exactly is differentiated about it that will lead to higher returns than what we\\'ve historically seen in some of the independent E&Ps? Thirdly, to be fair, kind of the stored value, are there certain parts of the development process where Exxon Mobil\\'s advantage is just more pronounced? Specifically, thinking about drilling, completions and what people commonly refer to as the Exxon Mobil machine with procurement, supply and just bringing big scale into the Permian.Darren WoodsWell, I think as we look at ourselves in the Permian, our approach to Permian unconventional space versus maybe some of the independent E&Ps, for some, I think our objectives are somewhat different. We\\'re not focused on short-term production, getting volumes up to try to, in the short-term, quickly raise the value our company. That\\'s not an objective statement for us. We think about this as part of a long-term portfolio, like we do with the other resources that we\\'re trying to develop. And so, our focus is on maximizing NPV of those developments and recovering the most resources in the most cost competitive way. But that\\'s the objective and we\\'re not trying to drive short-term volume to the rest of – in fact, what I would tell you is we don\\'t start off with any volume targets. We start off with understanding those reservoirs and figuring out how to develop them effectively. I think that\\'s a big difference in terms of how we think about the approach there.I think the other big differentiation is, if you look at the size and the scale and the history of our company, we\\'re very different than a lot of other independent E&Ps. And I think what we\\'ve been very focused on and started talking about pretty explicitly in March is what does a company like Exxon Mobil, with the scale that we have and the experience that we have and the technology and the advantages that I talked about, what does that look like in the unconventional space.And my view was, from the very beginning, the way we develop those resources should look different than some of the smaller E&Ps because we have more to bring to that. And you see that today with the investments that we\\'re making where we\\'re thinking about all the horizons in a particular play and developing those in a way that maximize the recovery and the value of that resource. That means you have to be a little bit more patient. You have to spend capital out front to put in the infrastructure, to lay out the corridors that we\\'ve talked about in March, to effectively develop that resource. So, takes you a little longer, takes a little more capital, but you get a higher return and better recovery. And that\\'s one of the things that we\\'ve been doing in the Permian, which is different than a lot of the others.The other thing I would tell you is, if you look at unconventional and the shale, we\\'re very early in the technology cycle. In fact, while the industry has made great progress, and mainly independents have driven that, it would be – I would characterize it as more of an empirical process of trial and error and kind of testing and evolving, which has been very effective. But what we haven\\'t seen a lot of is, what I would say, is fundamental science and technology looking at unlocking more of those resources. And that\\'s one of the things we feel very strongly that we can bring to this game and will be very different than what others can because of the R&D capacity that we have within our company.So, one of the big drives that we have today is really focusing our technology and our researchers on better understanding the fundamentals of unconventional resources and figuring out how to unlock more of those resources and raise recovery.We\\'ve got a huge resource base, very low recovery rates today. If you can improve your recovery rate through technology, you can unlock a lot of resource instantly. You don\\'t have a discovery risk. You have this challenge of going on finding resources. It\\'s really a function of figuring out how you more effectively develop that resource. That\\'s where technology will play a role. I\\'m convinced of that.And if you go back in time and look at our industry over time, technology has always led to better recoveries and improved economics for developing resources. And I think we\\'re going to see that play itself out, and I would say that is a big difference that we can bring. And the final point I will make is, if you look at the capabilities of our organization, take drilling as an example that you mentioned, all around the world, we\\'ve tried to take the best technical competencies and capabilities we have in the organization and put them on the challenges of driving improvements in the unconventional drilling. And so, I think we\\'ve got the opportunity with our scale and size and the capabilities that I have I talked about to change the way that unconventional space is developed.Jeanine WaiSo, I wanted to maybe continue on that side. You talk about hitting all the different horizons, unlocking value. I think spacing has – the industry is learning, but spacing has become an issue over and over and over again. So, you mentioned technology and looking at the reservoir and all this, so how are you planning on avoiding some of the spacing issues that we\\'ve seen, especially since you\\'re talking about hitting all the zones and really maximizing the value versus maybe an ROR versus NPV approach?Darren WoodsThis idea that spacing is – that the industry has kind of discovered this challenge or issue, our view is we\\'ve always recognized these parent-child relationships, the communication between different areas. And so, what I think has been missing is the characterization of that, and maybe some of the broader industry hasn\\'t recognized that potential. And I think the drive to bring production on and get high IP has led to this kind of this very short-term approach to taking in a horizon and drilling that very quickly.As I said before, we\\'re stepping back and looking at the play in its entirety. One of the things that we\\'ve brought to the work that we\\'re doing in this space is we\\'ve taken what we think are some advantaged reservoir modeling and adapted that to work in unconventionals. And we\\'re using that then to look at all these horizons and understand how best to develop all the horizons and how to interact with one another. So, I think we\\'ve got some pretty good modeling of the horizons and how they interact. And the development plans that we\\'re putting together comprehend all that. And so, what she\\'s doing is drilling a number of the horizons and making sure that we do that in a manner that\\'s consistent and don\\'t start to bring production on until we have the full development laid out the way we wanted.So, again, it takes a little more time. You spend a little more capital upfront, but you get much more efficient production.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, inventory goes hand-in-hand with spacing. And I think there is some thought out there that people are drilling their best inventory first because of returns and the core inventory in the Permian is shrinking. So, in terms of your production target of achieving over 1 million barrels a day by 2020, do you have enough inventory to achieve that? What does the inventory look like after that in terms of – are you high-grading or anything?Darren WoodsYeah. So, I\\'m going to just make the point, we didn\\'t have a production target. We didn\\'t go out and say how do we achieve a million barrels a day and then go figure if we\\'ve got inventory to go drill that. What we ended up saying is develop the resource in a way that we think maximizes the recovery, is a very grassroots buildup from the beginning of the fundamentals, and then once we figured out what was the optimum development of that,2 we stacked it to volumes to see what it came out to be. And that was what it came out to be. And so, the inventory, we\\'ve got, what, 6,500 wells or something. We\\'ve drilled 100. So, we\\'ve got a pretty big inventory that exists today.But, again, I think this idea that somehow we\\'re developing that resource to get to a volume number is – I would just tell you that is not the way that we\\'re thinking about it. We\\'re looking at it on a returns basis and how do you develop that resource and get a high return for the dollars that you spend.A lot of people have asked questions about the depletion rates and what does it mean after you hit this 1 million barrels. And my view is we\\'re not trying to sustain a particular volume. We\\'re trying to sustain an economic return. And so, our investments that will continue past the profile that we provided will be a function of what we see the economics being for the development. And if that means sustaining the million barrels, we\\'ll do that. If that means coming off the million barrels, we\\'ll do that as well because it, ultimately, is going to be a value proposition. And that\\'s the way we\\'re looking at it.My sense is that, by that time, we will have unlocked some of these technology advantages that I talked about and that will start to have implications and impact on what we\\'ve already done. So, my sense is there are things today that we don\\'t know that will have implications there, but only time will tell.Jeanine WaiOkay. We\\'ve got now one minute left. And I can\\'t help myself. Consolidation. Extremely topical right now in energy in general. Can you share with us your broad thoughts on consolidation in the Permian basin? And how does Exxon Mobil fit in with that?Darren WoodsWell, I think if you look at what I would say are the historical trends of developing industries, you have this period of a lot of independents, a lot of small players that eventually all consolidate. I don\\'t see any dynamics that would make that different or that historical model play out differently in the unconventional space. So, I expect consolidation to happen over some period of time. And I wouldn\\'t say that we\\'re predicting when it will happen. But what our focus is on is understanding what the value opportunities out there are and making sure that we\\'re aware of and participating in the valuation, so that if there is an opportunity to acquire something that brings value, unique value to Exxon Mobil, we\\'ll be in a position to transact on that. But I think, right now, there\\'s some time. I think time\\'s on our side to let that kind of play itself out. And I think people need to recalibrate kind of what they\\'re experiencing in that unconventional space and that will have an impact on how people value companies and understand what the value proposition is and we\\'ll continue to develop our thinking. I think as we advance some of these technologies that bring us even greater advantages there, that increases the value opportunities with respect to maybe some other companies that don\\'t have those advantages. So, we\\'re keeping a watchful eye. I think we\\'re there for the long term. And as opportunities present themselves, we\\'ll take advantage of them.Jeanine WaiWell, time flies and you\\'re having fun. And we\\'re just about out of time. So, it\\'s really been our privilege. Thank you so much, Darren, for your time.Darren WoodsSure. Thank you, Jeanine. Thank you.'"

       "Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Softec Barclays Energy Conference September  4, 2019  7:40 AM ETCompany ParticipantsDarren Woods - Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerConference Call ParticipantsJeanine Wai - Barclays plcJeanine WaiWell, good morning, everyone. It's so nice to see so many faces today, bright and early. Today it is very much our privilege to have Mr. Darren Woods here with us, Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil. Born in Wichita, Kansas, Darren Woods is a graduate of Texas A&M University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering. He also holds a Master of Business Administration degree from Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management.Mr. Woods joined Exxon Mobil International in 1992 as a planning analyst in Florham Park, New Jersey. He progressed through a number of domestic and international assignment for Exxon Company International, Exxon Mobil Chemical Company and Exxon Mobil Refining & Supply Company.In 2005, Mr. Woods was appointed Vice President of Exxon Mobil Chemical Company. In 2008, he was named Exxon Mobil Refining & Supply Company's Director of Refining in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, followed by Vice President of Supply and Transportation in 2010. Mr. Woods was then appointed President of Exxon Mobil Refining and Supply Company and Vice President of Exxon Mobil Corporation in 2012.From here, he progressed to being elected Senior Vice President in 2014 and President of Exxon Mobil Corporation and a member of the board of directors in 2016.Effective January 1, 2017, Mr. Woods became the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which is his current position.Outside of Exxon Mobil, Mr. Woods is the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute and a member of its executive committee. He's also a member of the National Petroleum Council, the Business Roundtable, the Business Council and the Texas A&M University Engineering Advisory Council.So, without further ado, it is my pleasure to turn it over to Mr. Darren Woods. Darren WoodsThank you, Jeanine. Good morning, everyone. Great to be here. I'm really pleased to have this opportunity to talk about Exxon Mobil's business. Some of you will recall that, for the first time in 2018, we've publicly laid out an eight-year plan. And over the past 18 months, we've tried to keep the investment community updated on our progress. The last update was with Neil Chapman in early August as part of our earnings call. I have to say that I feel real good about the progress we're making. And my sense is that, generally, there's a good understanding of our plans and progress. However, as the world looks to lower their carbon emissions and respond to the risk of climate change, there is a desire to better understand how robust our plans are to evolve in policies and changing market trends. And today, I'll address this and demonstrate how Exxon Mobil's strategy and plans capitalize on the industry fundamentals to grow long-term shareholder value.Of course, we can't begin this discussion without the appropriate cautionary statement. I'll give you some time to read this. Basically, it says we can't predict the future. But I will tell you, it doesn't stop us from trying. Our view of future demand has been reasonably good over time. However, the path to realizing it has been anything but a straight line. It's difficult to predict how the fundamentals of long-term demand will manifest themselves in the short term. There are just way, way too many variables.Which is why we instead focus on building a business that is robust to a range of short-term outcomes that are all consistent with long-term fundamentals. On the supply side, advances in technology play a critical role. These are also very difficult to predict and can lead to a future very different than today. Which is why we put such an emphasis on R&D and in understanding the technology landscape. And I'll talk more about this as we move through the presentation.Let me begin by outlining the topics I'll cover. I'm going to focus my comments on energy, but most of my points are also applicable to our chemical business. I'll discuss what drives demand, what determines supply and how we are working to meet demand for both additional energy and lower CO2 emission, while delivering growth in shareholder value. Let's look first at what drives demand. And that begins with people. People trying to improve standards of living for themselves and for their families. Starts with the basics – access to food, water and housing, then moves to light and heat for homes and schools, access to medical treatment, transportation and modern conveniences like refrigeration and air conditioning. This then leads to higher levels of education and income as well as improved living conditions, longer lives and a number of other advantages that frankly we sometimes take for granted.The United Nations has attempted to characterize people's well-being with the Human Development Index. This index measures achievements in three key dimensions. First, gross national income per capita as a proxy for a standard of living. Second, longevity as a proxy for health. And third, years of education.It is encouraging to see the progress made over time in these three areas. On average, the global population is better educated, earning more and living longer. At the same time, it is sobering to see how far some societies have yet to go.The drive to improve living standards will continue, particularly for those less well-off. This in turn will drive the demand for energy. We can use the development index to help with projecting future demand for global energy. This chart links the index for a country shown on the y-axis with its energy consumption shown on the x-axis. The size of the bubble represents the population size. As you can see, there is a clear correlation. As standards rise, so does consumption of energy. This makes sense if you think about the conveniences of modern life.For us here in the United States and much of the Western world, shown in the upper right of the chart, it's difficult to imagine that half the world's population, roughly 4 billion people, have a life expectancy of 10 years less than ours, receive a third less education and one in four don't have access to electricity. In fact, today, about 13% of the global population still don't have access to electricity. This has enormous implications for future energy demand. Let me use China and India as examples. In 1990, both were low on the index and consumed less than 100,000 BTUs of energy per capita. By 2017, the living standards of people in both countries has significantly improved, which also drove a significant increase in energy demand.China's demand tripled and India's nearly doubled. The relationship between societal progress and energy consumption is indisputable. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to modern life. As billions of people strive for better living conditions, the world's need for energy will continue to grow. This relationship is very important and underpins the future of our business. It's fair to ask, though, what form will future energy take. No one can say with absolute certainty. Society wants less carbon emissions, but – to be broadly accepted – sources of new energy must be reliable and affordable. Given today's alternatives, that means technology has a critical role to play.Over 90% of global energy emissions come from three sectors – power generation, transportation and the industrial sector. Today, hydrocarbons meet more than 85% of the energy needs from these sectors. Hydrocarbons are energy dense, they work at scale, are globally available and easily transported which makes them affordable and reliable, and hence the fuel of choice.However, we know that their use contributes to global CO2 emissions, which is driving the need for alternative sources of energy.To successfully compete, though, these alternatives will require similar attributes. Unfortunately, existing alternatives don't consistently provide them. As such, today, they offer only a partial solution. A comprehensive solution will require advances in technology and, in some cases, a breakthrough. Let me illustrate the point, starting with power. Solar and wind offer lower emissions. However, they are limited to areas with enough sun and wind. They require significant land area and are intermittent, with no practical storage solutions that work at scale.Natural gas works at scale, but requires advances in carbon capture to compete on admissions with solar and wind. Additionally, in some markets such as India and China, the cost of natural gas compared to coal is higher.Lithium-ion batteries provide an alternative to fuel light-duty vehicles, albeit with trade-offs on range and refueling times. For heavy-duty vehicles and aviation, existing battery technologies lack the energy density needed.Finally, energy solutions in the industrial sector must be reliable and cost competitive. This substantially limits the use of solar and wind. Similar to power, the industrial sector requires advances in carbon capture to effectively reduce emissions.Now, in pointing these deficiencies out, I'm not arguing against the alternatives. I'm arguing for additional research and development. Fortunately, there are many organizations doing this, including Exxon Mobil.We are optimistic that these collective efforts will result in advances that address the deficiencies. We don't believe it's a question of if, but when. However, once solutions are developed, time will be needed to fully penetrate the world's global energy system.Let me give you a sense for this on the next chart. Throughout time and across industries, we see the same trend. After initial discovery, technologies can take decades to fully develop and gain widespread adoption. This can be seen in the US as an example. The chart shows the time it took to fully adopt a sample of technologies. Technologies that met an unfilled need with no real switching costs, like the Internet, telephones and personal computers, were adopted relatively quickly, but still took up to 50 years.In other areas, adoption is impacted by available substitutes, perceived benefits, affordability, switching cost and government policies. Wind is a good example. First commercialized for utilities in the 1980s, today it is used by less than 10% of US households. And as you can see, despite the perception, penetration of lithium batteries to transportation remains low even after decades of development.Bottom line, when you think about adoption of new technologies in the context of the global energy system, think in multiples of decades. Society's experience to date illustrates this and you'll see this on the next chart. Oil was first used as an energy source in the 1870s and took roughly 100 years to replace coal as the world's dominant form of energy.And while has been recognized for decades as a carbon-intensive, particulate-laden energy source, it continued to grow until 2013. Today, it makes up 26% of the global energy mix and is expected to maintain a 20% share in 2040. Wind and solar today represent about 1% of the global energy mix and, by 2040, are projected to make up 4%.And despite tis many deficiencies as a fuel and its impact on health, traditional biomass remains an important source of energy in many societies.This chart illustrates a fundamental reality. Energy transitions take a long time. Another fundamental reality seen in the persistent use of biomass is that a society's choice of energy is primarily driven by availability and affordability, which brings us back to the role of technology – to develop a source of energy that is affordable and widely available with lower global emissions.This is where we will make a difference. Exxon Mobil has a deep competency in fundamental science. Extensive R&D capabilities and over 100 years of experience in the global energy business. We are actively investing in the development of lower emissions technologies that have the highest potential for large-scale deployment. We are progressing advanced algae and cellulosic biofuels as potential solution for commercial transportation.Unlike first generation biofuels, these technologies have the potential to provide a renewable source that does not compete with supplies of food or freshwater. Biofuels emit about half as much greenhouse gas as petroleum-derived fuel and have the potential for large-scale production. They also provide the energy density required for planes and trucks.To address power and industrial uses, we are pursuing a number of options to make carbon capture technology more economic. In manufacturing, we're working on new plant configurations, processes and catalysts to reduce energy use and lower emissions. Our efforts include working with a variety of external organizations, pursuing a range of potential solutions. We collaborate across a broad spectrum of science-based organizations in both the public and private sector, including aiding universities around the world, the US national labs, technology venture funds and partnerships with private companies.Our research organization also maintains a broad aperture on external developments, monitoring all relevant advances and discoveries. So, while we can't predict advances in technology, we won't be surprised by them. In the meantime, the world's rising demand for energy must be met. Over the next two decades, the world's population is expected to grow by 20% and the middle class to nearly double. This is expected to result in a 20% increase in global energy demand.In OECD countries, energy demand declines with improved efficiencies. Coal use is expected to shrink, while oil and gas continue to meet the majority demand, with a shift towards gas.India and China account for half of the new global demand, resulting in increases across most energy sources. Let me pause here for a moment because this is important. To successfully reduce global emissions, given their growth, the world needs affordable solutions for India and China. In other words, if we don't solve the problem for India and China, we don't solve the problem.Finally, in Africa, a significant amount of demand is expected to come from biomass, while the demand for oil and gas grows. As you can see, oil and gas will continue to play a critical role in meeting society's needs.This is our view of the long-term fundamentals and it's consistent with independent assessments by both the IEA and the EIA. Our outlook is also in line with the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. This view underpins our strategies and plans.Given its significance, I'll spend a little more time on the industry fundamentals with some additional context. Our outlook projects oil demand to grow at 0.6% a year and gas demand to grow by 1.3%.When you factor in depletion rates, new oil production needs to increase by nearly 8% per year and natural gas by 6%. You can see this when we overlay our demand charts with the depletion charts.The dark blue areas on the chart shows existing supplies that decline over time. The light blue areas show additional supplies needed to meet expected demand.Under any demand scenario, including 2 degree scenarios, shown by the red diamond, depletion in and of itself supports the need for significant industry investments.The IEA estimates that approximately $21 trillion of additional industry investments are needed by 2040. This is a compelling investment case for the industry. Its' an even more compelling case for Exxon Mobil. We are creating industry-leading value through unique set of competitive advantages, leading to large-scale businesses with low-cost supply and higher performing products. This allows us to successfully compete across a range of price cycles.I have spoken about these five advantages many times – our technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and world-class people. Each of these advantages are significant in their own right. Taken together, they create unparalleled organizational strength, adaptability and capability. We use them to capture and develop high return, resilient opportunities, leveraging our strong balance sheet across the range of price environments.Good examples of this are the Permian, InterOil and Mozambique acquisitions, all undertaken during the last down cycle. Currently, we have the best portfolio of investment opportunities since Exxon and Mobil merged.Each project in our portfolio is evaluated for advantages relative to competition and against our other opportunities. The returns are stress tested across a range of price scenarios. The chart in the upper left provides a perspective of the value of these projects over time in a range of price environments and the value they bring to our business. While we are happy with the projects we have in our portfolio, we continue to look for additional opportunities. In a depletion business, to sustain the long-term value, you have to. As new opportunities are captured, we have the option to reprioritize capital, putting a priority on investments with the highest NPV.Existing projects in the portfolio have to compete with every new opportunity. This allows us to high-grade our portfolio through selective divestments. It was the primary driver of the $15 billion program we announced earlier this year.The size of this program could grow if continue to capture more attractive opportunities, which is exactly what we're working to do through active exploration and evaluation of potential acquisitions.We feel very good about our opportunity set. We have lots of options and the flexibility to optimize on value and mitigate risk as circumstances change. If there's any sure thing in this business, it's that circumstances will change.We don't need to look any further than the first half of this year to see that play out. Current market conditions highlight the benefits of our strategy and competitive advantages, particularly our scale and the size and strength of our balance sheet.The chart in the top left provides a range of commodity prices and margins over the past 10 years compared to the prices and margins experienced in the first half of 2019.As you can see, all of our businesses are below the median with two at or near historic lows. And while I won't say we predicted this, I can say that we anticipated it. Today's levels are consistent with our historical experience and, importantly, consistent with the scenarios that we used to evaluate our businesses and investments.Even with the extreme weakness in both the downstream and chemicals sectors, the project we recently started up in both these businesses are earnings and cash accretive, demonstrating their advantages.Also want to use the current price environment to highlight the financial strength of our company. The line on the chart at the bottom left shows an estimate of our debt to capital ratio over time, assuming that current market conditions persist through 2025 and the continued execution of our existing plans.As you can see, even in a prolonged, bottom-of-the-cycle margin environment in two of our sectors, we continue to fund our current investments, maintain a reliable and growing dividend and retain the capacity for a sizable acquisition without compromising the financial capacity of the company.Now, while history tells us that bottom-of-cycle conditions like this don't persist for a long time, it's a good test of our businesses, investment portfolio and financial strength. It also gives us the confidence to continue to pursue our advantaged investments.So, with that, let me turn to the investments that underpin our plans to grow value. The status of each of these was shared by Neil Chapman during our recent earnings call. I'll reiterate some of the key points.We have made significant progress on all projects across all of our businesses. The schedules remain consistent with the plans we shared and they continue to look attractive even in current market conditions.Our investment philosophy remains centered on competitiveness rather than price. Each project leverages critical elements of our unique advantages and are expected to grow earnings, cash flow and returns across a wide range of price environments.Let me conclude by summarizing a few key points. Demand for energy is tied to economic activity and people's desire to improve their standards of living. So long as economies grow and people's lives improve, the demand for affordable and reliable energy will remain.Meeting the growing need for energy and addressing the risk of climate change are not mutually exclusive. They represent industry's dual challenge and will require additional solutions and technology breakthroughs. But it's always been this way. As society's needs evolve, so do we. Typically through technology. This is why, over the years, we have been steadfast in our commitment to technology and investments in research and development. We leverage our research to develop new technologies to meet new needs and improve the returns of projects that meet existing needs. Aspects of all of our advantages, technology, scale, integration, functional excellence and people come together to deliver industry-leading projects and, ultimately, growth in shareholder value.All in, where I started today. We have an outstanding portfolio of investment opportunities. We have a solid plan to deliver those investments and feel real good about the progress we're making.With that, I want to thank you for your attention and I'll hand it back to Jeanine for Q&As. Thank you.Question-and-Answer SessionQ - Jeanine WaiThank you so much, Darren, for your comment. Really appreciate it. It was very insightful. So, we're going to spend about the next 20 minutes doing a fireside chat and we've got a bunch of questions. So, I hope we can get through a lot of them.I think I'll just start off more broadly fundamentally. In your view, do you think the industry is under investing relative to the supply required to meet demand? And if that is your view, when do you think it's going to show up in the oil balances.Darren WoodsWell, we looked at this earlier this year as part of the March analyst and investment. And I mentioned IEA's estimate of the amount of investments needed by the industry through 2040. We looked at allocating that to the existing competitors on a share basis. And, basically, concluded that Exxon Mobil's investment levels were in line with the IEA's estimate. Most of our competitors and peers were investing at levels that were below their historical investment rates and below what will be required based on the IEA estimated. So, we concluded from that that there probably was some underinvestment in the market at the time. With respect to when that kind of manifests itself in the broader markets, I think it's very difficult to tell. We, and I think the industry in general, have struggled to really ever predict exactly how the supply and demand balances will kind of manifest themselves in short term. So, we don't really focus on when we're going to see that. So, instead, we focus on making sure that we're ready for it when it comes. And we think that what we're doing today with our investment profile that, if that impact comes and supply/demand balances open up, and there's a shortage of supply, we'll be in a position to meet a lot of that demand.Jeanine WaiOkay. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there are a number of factors related to the oil price environment. And from our perspective, investors seem to really value flexibility these days, given volatility in oil prices. So, when we look at your portfolio, is there a flexibility to cut back on CapEx if the current market conditions persist? Maybe what would trigger that and where would you cut back first?Darren WoodsI think there's always flexibility to cut back, but there's a level of inefficiency and higher cost that goes with any of that cutback. The short cycle investments, obviously, carry less costs. Although I would say – people talk a lot about the shale and the unconventional plays as being short cycle and, therefore, lot more flexibility which is true, but I would tell you, with the work that we're doing in technology and the work we're doing in terms of getting the organization focused on this manufacturing mode of driving efficiencies and improving, that any short-term disruption in that is going to have an impact on our ability to kind of drive that progress. So, I would tell you that it would be – we would look at reluctantly pulling back on CapEx if we felt like we needed to.But our strategy has always been, and continues to be, to invest in projects that are competitive in a range of price environments. And if you look at what we're doing with our short cycle investments in the unconventional space, that has strong returns even at low oil prices, below $35 a barrel. So, our view would be, with a robust return even at lower prices that we would continue to invest through the cycle because we have the financial capacity to do that and we generate good returns with it.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, you walked into this one. You mentioned short cycle and Permian. So, how do you think about short cycle versus long cycle? We hear a lot of this when people talk about Exxon Mobil and your peers. And so, is short versus long a consideration that you have when evaluating opportunities in your portfolio? And again, back to the flexibility, is the thinking that short cycle investments such as the Permian, is that easier to pull back in CapEx, like you said, but you've often talked about investing for the future and needing to do longer cycle, major capital projects. So, how are you thinking about short versus long, especially in the current environment?Darren WoodsI would tell you that the primary criteria we use to evaluate investments is on their competitiveness and the ability to generate industry-leading returns. So, all of our investments across the upstream and the short and long cycle, as well as chemical and refining sector, we look at whether or not those investments are advantaged versus the rest of industry.And one dimension that we look at is our cost to supply with respect to the rest of industry. And we insist that the investments that we're making are advantaged versus industry, and on the very left, there's a cost to supply curve. So, as the supply and demand balances fluctuate, and as you see price cycles come off and prices drop, we want to make sure that our investments are positioned on the far left hand side, and so continue to make earnings and cash even in the low parts of the cycle.And we see that today demonstrated in our downstream and chemical business. So, I showed you the charts that kind of depict how challenged those two injuries are right now. If you look at the investments that we made and just brought on, they're all cash positive and earnings positive even in these very low cycle conditions. So, we feel real good about those projects. And we see the same with our investments in the upstream.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, I guess, sticking to the projects that are cash positive, earnings positive, free cash flow, definitely a key topic in energy right now. Can you talk about when you see Exxon Mobil's inflection in free cash flow? And what factors do you think would either pull that forward or enhance it?Darren WoodsThe factors I would tell you would be primarily market-driven. Since we don't try to predict where the margins and prices are going, as those move around, we'll generate more revenue potentially or less and that will move the free cash flow around.And again, what I'd come back to, we've looked at that profile of spend and we've tested it around a range of environments. And one of the advantages of having a strong balance sheet is to make sure that we are not whipsawing our businesses around with the volatility in the markets. I think that's one of the advantages that the scale that we have brings to this business, and that constancy of purpose of investing in advantaged projects over the long-term, I think, delivers over the medium-term and long-term greater shareholder value than trying to chase the price cycles.And I think you can see that today with kind of the volatility of the marketplace. Imagine trying to run your business, a capital-intensive, long-term investment, with the changes that we're seeing every day in the market out there. I think that would be a very difficult proposition. So, instead, if you're convinced that you can run and be successful at the bottom end of the marketplace, we pay a lot of attention to it and make sure that the dynamics that we're seeing don't change our thinking about some of these fundamentals. But as you heard in the presentation, the way we look at the business is tied to some very basic fundamentals that haven't changed for decades, if not hundreds of years.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, in terms of not trying to whipsaw the program, not chasing price, investing on fundamentals, maybe just a question on capital allocation. So, relative to your peers, you're spending more and you're doing it countercyclically and you're not doing any buybacks right now. So, could you share with us what the first call is on free cash flow, whether it's dividend, buybacks or reinvestment? And kind of what your though process is on all of those?Darren WoodsLet me first just make the point about our level of investment. I think one of the things that isn't always done when people talk about the level we're investing at is normalize it for our size. So, if you look at our investment level compared to the size of our business, we use cash flow from operations as a proxy for size. The level that we're investing at today is pretty consistent with the level that we've invested at historically, and we think it's what's required to drive and sustain the long-term value of the business. So, we don't think of where we're at today as being necessarily a higher level of spending. Our peers are at lower levels than they've historically spent at, which comes back to this question that you asked earlier about if industry is under investing.With respect to how we choose to reallocate our capital, I think the first priority for us is investing in projects that are advantaged versus industry, and we'll continue to grow value for the company. The point I made in the presentation, this is a depletion. So, you're on this treadmill. If you're not investing for the future, you're retreating. And that's certainly true in the upstream. And in the chemical business, with the growth market, if you're not investing, you're losing market position.So, from our perspective, to be a long-term viable company, and that's the way we think about it, we have to make sure that we're continuing to invest in attractive and advantaged projects. So, that's the first priority because it will underpin the ability for our company to do anything else going forward in the future.The second priority is we feel like we've had a commitment to our shareholders to pay a reliable and growing dividend. So, that's pretty high on our priority list. When And then, we want to make sure that we maintain the financial capacity to transact at the bottom of cycle conditions. And so, one of the things that we're constantly stress testing as we look at where we want to take dividends as we look at our capital investment program is do we have the capacity for an acquisition when prices come off and the market is depressed because we think those are where we'll see value opportunities. And so, we maintain a buffer. And that would be the priorities of our capital allocation.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, switching gears, if you don't mind, to the Permian.Darren WoodsSure.Jeanine WaiWe think that there's just a ton of buzz and questions on what we've called kind of \"major mojo\" in the Permian. So, if you don't mind, why exactly is your development plan in the Permian unique? And what exactly is differentiated about it that will lead to higher returns than what we've historically seen in some of the independent E&Ps? Thirdly, to be fair, kind of the stored value, are there certain parts of the development process where Exxon Mobil's advantage is just more pronounced? Specifically, thinking about drilling, completions and what people commonly refer to as the Exxon Mobil machine with procurement, supply and just bringing big scale into the Permian.Darren WoodsWell, I think as we look at ourselves in the Permian, our approach to Permian unconventional space versus maybe some of the independent E&Ps, for some, I think our objectives are somewhat different. We're not focused on short-term production, getting volumes up to try to, in the short-term, quickly raise the value our company. That's not an objective statement for us. We think about this as part of a long-term portfolio, like we do with the other resources that we're trying to develop. And so, our focus is on maximizing NPV of those developments and recovering the most resources in the most cost competitive way. But that's the objective and we're not trying to drive short-term volume to the rest of – in fact, what I would tell you is we don't start off with any volume targets. We start off with understanding those reservoirs and figuring out how to develop them effectively. I think that's a big difference in terms of how we think about the approach there.I think the other big differentiation is, if you look at the size and the scale and the history of our company, we're very different than a lot of other independent E&Ps. And I think what we've been very focused on and started talking about pretty explicitly in March is what does a company like Exxon Mobil, with the scale that we have and the experience that we have and the technology and the advantages that I talked about, what does that look like in the unconventional space.And my view was, from the very beginning, the way we develop those resources should look different than some of the smaller E&Ps because we have more to bring to that. And you see that today with the investments that we're making where we're thinking about all the horizons in a particular play and developing those in a way that maximize the recovery and the value of that resource. That means you have to be a little bit more patient. You have to spend capital out front to put in the infrastructure, to lay out the corridors that we've talked about in March, to effectively develop that resource. So, takes you a little longer, takes a little more capital, but you get a higher return and better recovery. And that's one of the things that we've been doing in the Permian, which is different than a lot of the others.The other thing I would tell you is, if you look at unconventional and the shale, we're very early in the technology cycle. In fact, while the industry has made great progress, and mainly independents have driven that, it would be – I would characterize it as more of an empirical process of trial and error and kind of testing and evolving, which has been very effective. But what we haven't seen a lot of is, what I would say, is fundamental science and technology looking at unlocking more of those resources. And that's one of the things we feel very strongly that we can bring to this game and will be very different than what others can because of the R&D capacity that we have within our company.So, one of the big drives that we have today is really focusing our technology and our researchers on better understanding the fundamentals of unconventional resources and figuring out how to unlock more of those resources and raise recovery.We've got a huge resource base, very low recovery rates today. If you can improve your recovery rate through technology, you can unlock a lot of resource instantly. You don't have a discovery risk. You have this challenge of going on finding resources. It's really a function of figuring out how you more effectively develop that resource. That's where technology will play a role. I'm convinced of that.And if you go back in time and look at our industry over time, technology has always led to better recoveries and improved economics for developing resources. And I think we're going to see that play itself out, and I would say that is a big difference that we can bring. And the final point I will make is, if you look at the capabilities of our organization, take drilling as an example that you mentioned, all around the world, we've tried to take the best technical competencies and capabilities we have in the organization and put them on the challenges of driving improvements in the unconventional drilling. And so, I think we've got the opportunity with our scale and size and the capabilities that I have I talked about to change the way that unconventional space is developed.Jeanine WaiSo, I wanted to maybe continue on that side. You talk about hitting all the different horizons, unlocking value. I think spacing has – the industry is learning, but spacing has become an issue over and over and over again. So, you mentioned technology and looking at the reservoir and all this, so how are you planning on avoiding some of the spacing issues that we've seen, especially since you're talking about hitting all the zones and really maximizing the value versus maybe an ROR versus NPV approach?Darren WoodsThis idea that spacing is – that the industry has kind of discovered this challenge or issue, our view is we've always recognized these parent-child relationships, the communication between different areas. And so, what I think has been missing is the characterization of that, and maybe some of the broader industry hasn't recognized that potential. And I think the drive to bring production on and get high IP has led to this kind of this very short-term approach to taking in a horizon and drilling that very quickly.As I said before, we're stepping back and looking at the play in its entirety. One of the things that we've brought to the work that we're doing in this space is we've taken what we think are some advantaged reservoir modeling and adapted that to work in unconventionals. And we're using that then to look at all these horizons and understand how best to develop all the horizons and how to interact with one another. So, I think we've got some pretty good modeling of the horizons and how they interact. And the development plans that we're putting together comprehend all that. And so, what she's doing is drilling a number of the horizons and making sure that we do that in a manner that's consistent and don't start to bring production on until we have the full development laid out the way we wanted.So, again, it takes a little more time. You spend a little more capital upfront, but you get much more efficient production.Jeanine WaiOkay. So, inventory goes hand-in-hand with spacing. And I think there is some thought out there that people are drilling their best inventory first because of returns and the core inventory in the Permian is shrinking. So, in terms of your production target of achieving over 1 million barrels a day by 2020, do you have enough inventory to achieve that? What does the inventory look like after that in terms of – are you high-grading or anything?Darren WoodsYeah. So, I'm going to just make the point, we didn't have a production target. We didn't go out and say how do we achieve a million barrels a day and then go figure if we've got inventory to go drill that. What we ended up saying is develop the resource in a way that we think maximizes the recovery, is a very grassroots buildup from the beginning of the fundamentals, and then once we figured out what was the optimum development of that,2 we stacked it to volumes to see what it came out to be. And that was what it came out to be. And so, the inventory, we've got, what, 6,500 wells or something. We've drilled 100. So, we've got a pretty big inventory that exists today.But, again, I think this idea that somehow we're developing that resource to get to a volume number is – I would just tell you that is not the way that we're thinking about it. We're looking at it on a returns basis and how do you develop that resource and get a high return for the dollars that you spend.A lot of people have asked questions about the depletion rates and what does it mean after you hit this 1 million barrels. And my view is we're not trying to sustain a particular volume. We're trying to sustain an economic return. And so, our investments that will continue past the profile that we provided will be a function of what we see the economics being for the development. And if that means sustaining the million barrels, we'll do that. If that means coming off the million barrels, we'll do that as well because it, ultimately, is going to be a value proposition. And that's the way we're looking at it.My sense is that, by that time, we will have unlocked some of these technology advantages that I talked about and that will start to have implications and impact on what we've already done. So, my sense is there are things today that we don't know that will have implications there, but only time will tell.Jeanine WaiOkay. We've got now one minute left. And I can't help myself. Consolidation. Extremely topical right now in energy in general. Can you share with us your broad thoughts on consolidation in the Permian basin? And how does Exxon Mobil fit in with that?Darren WoodsWell, I think if you look at what I would say are the historical trends of developing industries, you have this period of a lot of independents, a lot of small players that eventually all consolidate. I don't see any dynamics that would make that different or that historical model play out differently in the unconventional space. So, I expect consolidation to happen over some period of time. And I wouldn't say that we're predicting when it will happen. But what our focus is on is understanding what the value opportunities out there are and making sure that we're aware of and participating in the valuation, so that if there is an opportunity to acquire something that brings value, unique value to Exxon Mobil, we'll be in a position to transact on that. But I think, right now, there's some time. I think time's on our side to let that kind of play itself out. And I think people need to recalibrate kind of what they're experiencing in that unconventional space and that will have an impact on how people value companies and understand what the value proposition is and we'll continue to develop our thinking. I think as we advance some of these technologies that bring us even greater advantages there, that increases the value opportunities with respect to maybe some other companies that don't have those advantages. So, we're keeping a watchful eye. I think we're there for the long term. And as opportunities present themselves, we'll take advantage of them.Jeanine WaiWell, time flies and you're having fun. And we're just about out of time. So, it's really been our privilege. Thank you so much, Darren, for your time.Darren WoodsSure. Thank you, Jeanine. Thank you."

      "So, instead, if you're convinced that you can run and be successful at the bottom end of the marketplace, we pay a lot of attention to it and make sure that the dynamics that we're seeing don't change our thinking about some of these fundamentals.\n",

      "Sentence 285:\n",
      "Jeanine WaiOkay.\n",
      "\n",

       " \"Thanks Todd. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with solid revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year. This top line increase was driven by both organic growth as well as inorganic growth from our recent acquisition of C Enterprises. Organically, we continue to generate solid sales in a wireless carrier ecosystem in addition to growing our distribution business.\",\n",
       " 'Inorganically, we benefited from a full quarter of sales from C Enterprises and saw their sales improved significantly during the first quarter as the team performed very well. The C Enterprises acquisition is a great example of our ability to bolt-on a complementary business and then enhance their growth by making targeted investments and including them as part of our organization and culture.',\n",
       " \"It’s this combination of healthy organic and inorganic growth that gives me confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $100 million in sales in the next couple of years. I'll talk more about that later in the call.\",\n",
       " \"Through the first three quarters this year, we're almost flat to last year through three quarters, even with last year's huge Q2, if I were to summarize simply how we're performing this year is that our core business has experienced nice organic growth, our acquisition has performed well and our concentrated Tier-1 wireless carrier business is still delivering nice results, though as expected, they’re at a lower pace so far compared to last year and the timing of sales can be inconsistent.\",\n",
       " \"We feel good about our potential to continue organic growth in our core business, and accept the carrier related spending can cause wild swings for us. But we love that business and the opportunities that it presents us. Our strategy of getting to the end user customers and then making it easy for them to purchase in whatever way they prefer is no more apparent than in a wireless carrier ecosystem. And we're working hard to leverage those successes into new relationships and projects.\",\n",
       " \"In the third quarter, we also delivered net income of over $1 million. We did see a little pressure on our margins, which Mark will explain and talk more about in a few minutes. As we've said many times previously, we're proud that we can make money and be profitable at varying revenue levels. So even as revenues and margins move around a little bit as we transform the company and grow, we have a cost structure that's flexible and allows us to be very profitable.\",\n",
       " 'As I talked about on prior calls, the macro headwinds of wage pressures and our relationships with tariffs can affect our margins sometimes here is, since the costs associated with our production teams is built into our gross margin line and material delays can obviously slow us down.',\n",
       " \"We've taken the opportunity to invest in our people and operations to allow for increased production capacity at multiple of our locations. Rewarding and retaining our production talent is crucial for us and I'm thankful to be able to provide increases, so these loyal team members can share in our success.\",\n",
       " \"We're planning for our future and these [events] should allow us to support much higher revenue levels as we work to grow the business.\",\n",
       " \"Our backlog at quarter end was $8 million on third quarter bookings of $13.4 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we've seen backlog increase further and it currently stands at just above $10 million.\",\n",
       " \"This again illustrates the nature of our business where the significant volume of potential orders in our pipeline, and the timing of those orders can affect frequent changes to our backlog when a snapshot is taken at quarter-end. In other words, with sales volumes like ours, a million or 2 million purchase order can cause wild swings in a few days. As I've said several times in the past, this is about long-term transformation of the company and while an update every quarter is healthy, our results are easier to understand with a long-term view.\",\n",
       " \"I'm pleased with our bookings in Q3 and on that topic it’s important to note that a large portion of C Enterprises business is booking shift in a very short period of time meeting their sales will show up in our bookings number but often won't be material in our long-term backlog number.\",\n",
       " \"It's all about timing. Going forward we’ll continue to provide both a backlog and booking number each quarter as we've been doing in order to give visibility into how we're executing across our entire organization. During the quarter, we generated continuous sales from the Tier-1 wireless carrier ecosystem. Most of that is showing up in our Custom Cable segment and delivered by our Cables Unlimited team in Long Island, New York which performed extremely well.\",\n",
       " \"We also saw increased business from our distribution channels, as evidenced by the continued growth we're experiencing in our RF Cable and Connector segment which grew about 4% sequentially and a little over 10% year-over-year. This represents the third straight quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year for this segment, underscoring the success we're seeing in executing our strategy to drive more business through distribution.\",\n",
       " \"While the wireless ecosystem continues to be our biggest opportunity, we also see significant opportunities for growth in other areas. One of these is the Transportation segment where we saw some good sales growth this quarter, and believe there's an opportunity for both our custom and run rate products.\",\n",
       " \"We're just getting going with a new OEM customer that has a large public transportation opportunity that we feel very positive about. This is another good example of how we're working and starting to be successful in expanding the reach of our products beyond our historical target markets. We continue to see steady opportunities in other OEM market segments, which are primarily the industrial markets such as manufacturing, aerospace, defense, utilities, oil and gas, mining and agriculture.\",\n",
       " \"As I mentioned earlier, our strategy focuses on generating both organic growth through our continued penetration of our key market segments and also inorganic growth. As we acquire complementary companies, we believe we can help those businesses through investment and providing a reinvigorated approach to growth as they become aligned around a common set of larger goals. The acquisition of C Enterprises is a good example of how we're redeploying capital in a solid way to grow the business. In fact, I'm pleased to report that for the third quarter, C Enterprises generated sales of more than $3 million, well ahead of their historical annual run rate of $8.7 million.\",\n",
       " \"We don't necessarily expect that C Enterprises has achieved -- already achieved a consistent new run rate. But we've proven that in a fairly short time, we can generate a much higher revenue and profitability level in that business. As we know that the time we acquired C Enterprises, their margins were a little lower than our overall blended margins for the business. And so a bigger revenue contribution from them is going to impact our overall margins a little bit, which we saw in the third quarter. But as we've been able to expand the revenue line, we've been working to increase their margins, I have seen some decent progress.\",\n",
       " \"We continue to pursue a very robust and growing pipeline of acquisition candidates, our balance sheet remains strong and provides us with significant resources to go after additional acquisitions that make sense. And there's still a possibility of additional acquisitions this fiscal year. As far as acquisition targets, I'm generally interested in companies in the $10 million to $20 million revenue range to give us access to new product set and new customers or segments.\",\n",
       " \"I'd still love to find some larger potential acquisition targets in the range of $25 million to $30 million in sales. Every acquisition takes a lot of effort to integrate, in addition to the legal costs and other related costs. So I would rather put those resources to work on something larger and gain even more economies of scale. On a related note, I don't ever underestimate the importance of cultural fit when working through due diligence in an acquisition process. We're looking for talented like-minded leaders who want to be part of a positive long-term growth story. We want to get acquisitions right and not just go fast.\",\n",
       " \"As I had mentioned before, one area of product focus is expanding our overall offer of the small cell bill of materials, so we can capitalize on the identification opportunity related to the 5G build-out. We're also looking to potentially own other passive components that we can sell through our growing distribution channel.\",\n",
       " \"The 5G spend continues to be a big future opportunity, though not something we're consistently benefiting from today, we're having some good conversations on small cell applications, as well as on hybrid fiber opportunities that we believe will position us well for when that 5G spend accelerates.\",\n",
       " \"But we really haven't seen any change from the inconsistent spending pattern that's out there for 5G. We continue to see our distributed antenna system products perform well. And in small cell, we have numerous conversations going on with carriers, neutral hosts and other integrators on both standard products, and hybrid fiber solutions to try to spread out and get a stronger foothold in those markets.\",\n",
       " \"Our Cables Unlimited Group, which is the Long Island location where our team handled the hybrid fiber business has been doing such a good job getting products build and out the door that we've been given some new opportunities to do additional product types, mostly related to traditional wireless macro sites, which has resulted in some potential new customers. Not all these have come to fruition yet, but from a customer standpoint, we think we've gained exposure to some additional pieces of business that can diversify us a little bit while we also continue to service our Tier-1 carrier customer extremely well.\",\n",
       " \"In the coming months, we’ll continue to work on key initiatives to further evolve the company with a positive growth culture and sales mindset. To that end, we're working to add our upgraded talent in key positions as we find savings through synergies and redundancies, we redeploy that capital to invest in the right talent to help move us forward. As I mentioned on a prior call, we've been reviewing our overall sales organization and expect to launch a modified sales structure before the new fiscal year to capitalize on our offer to the market and to further our approach of doing business the way our customers want to do business.\",\n",
       " \"Earlier, I shared that we've added production capacity over the past two years at multiple locations. We still have some best practice work to do on our operations and facilities. And think that over the next several quarters, we can make even more progress toward upgrading our capabilities.\",\n",
       " \"Finally, returning to the results, we're pleased with the steady progress that we're making in our multi-year transformation of the company. Through nine months this year, we're basically flat to the first nine months last year, which included that huge second quarter.\",\n",

That plan calls for low double-digit organic growth and layering in M&A for inorganic growth.',\n",

Our net sales in the third quarter were $15.5 million an increase of $1.9 million or 14% compared to the preceding second quarter an increase of $3.7 million or 31% compared to the third quarter year-ago. The increase in net sales reflects a full quarter of sales contribution from C Enterprises as well as growth in both our traditional run rate business and our project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets. Gross profit for the third quarter was $4.3 million, an increase of 4% compared to the preceding second quarter and up 6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.',\n",
       " 'Gross margins were 28% of net sales declined when compared to 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter primarily due to product mix as the product set our Tier-1 wireless carrier customer bought this past quarter happened to have a lower margin. In addition, we increased wages at all of our sites in order to reward and retain our protection workforce and in some cases to meet state mandated minimum wage requirements.',\n",
       " 'Selling and general expenses were $2.6 million, or 17% of sales, compared to $1.8 million or 15% of sales in the third quarter last year. The $8.8 million increase was primarily due to absorption of the additional selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises business as well as increased compensation due to the timing of bonus accruals. In addition the most recent quarter also included cost related to marketing programs geared to increased sales with our distribution partners.',\n",
       " 'We also incurred cost related to the evaluation of ongoing strategic acquisition transaction. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share compared to $1.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the preceding second quarter and $1.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.',\n",
       " \"Turning to the nine months of fiscal 2019, net sales were $39.8 million compared to $40.3 million last year, which as most of you know included the largest series of orders in the company's history. Gross profit for the first nine months was $11.5 million compared to $14.1 million while gross margins were 29% of sales compared to 35% of sales in the same period last year. The decline in gross margins was primarily due to the product mix that the Custom Cabling segment as well as increased wages for production team.\",\n",
       " 'Selling and general expenses were $7 million, or 18% of sales compared to $6.6 million or 16% of sales in the first nine months last year. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises business and one-time cost of $100,000 related to this acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 partially offset by a decrease in commission expense.',\n",
       " 'Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was $2.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $5.1 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period last year. At July 31, 2019 working capital was $26.7 million, up almost $3 million, since year-end, current ratio was 6 to 1 and there was no outstanding debt. Cash and cash equivalent was $13.3 million at the end of the third quarter, down from $13.9 million at the prior quarter-end.',\n",

       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, we don't really break it down that way. But it's a pretty meaningful amount. And if you look at our growth over the last year in that segment other than you've got an acquisition thrown in there but the majority of our growth last year and it kind of continues quarter-to-quarter now has come out of that, that direct business or it's going to that same handful of customers, even if it did directly, we sort of we had it going both directly and indirectly, but it ends up in the same place to allow for the build.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " 'And is that business subject to all like any of these long-term contracts or purchase orders, or is it just very quick term business with the formalized longer term agreements in place?',\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, so we have master service agreements in place with all the key customers in that space. And in that process, we've been through kind of the traditional bidding that goes on in order to win and then retain that business. So we have -- we have long-term relationships in place. We the way that that's handled though is we take purchase orders spread out over the course of time, when needed. We work closely with the various carriers and integrators to understand their needs and try to project as best possible but as my comments kind of pointed out, it's starts and stops and kind of a holding fashion isn't necessarily consistent, but we're communicating directly with them daily and weekly to talk through those projections. So it's a it's a long-term agreement that they draw against when needed.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " 'All right. And could you dive into a little bit about some of these key customers like which carriers you have these MSAs with specifically?',\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, so we don't actually disclose that and that's a long standing approach that we've had, it’s the same customer we've been working with for a few years now. And then various folks within their services ecosystem that we do business with as well. But we've been asked to keep that to ourselves, let's say. So we don't disclose it that way. There's only so many potential customers out there though I recognize that.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " \"And then I guess what's really the differentiator between you and some of the other competitors both large and small that enable you to win some of this cell tower cabling business specifically?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, so I think there's a couple of things I mean, our engineering capabilities are really good especially on the hybrid fiber, power and fiber in one, in one cable, those designs are really great quality and the team has done a good job of putting those together and then I think our flexibility and then customer service and turnaround time, we're very customer friendly in the sense that we have a Custom Cable segment for reason, we call that for a reason, it doesn't have to be a standard off-the-shelf thing and while a lot of our larger competitors maybe would prefer to do a much larger run with hundreds or thousands of the same exact cable.\",\n",
       " 'When you get into the macro sites in particular that are being hybrid fiber fed for the remote Radiohead deployments. The links are inconsistent, the breakout of how many fibers and or pieces of copper or the sizes of copper that go into those change pretty consistently. So I think it fits right into our wheelhouse of, we can handle a significant volume, but we can tweak the designs and the production capabilities around that and still hit reasonable timelines where we allow our customers to do their network deployments.',\n",
       " \"So I think generally in that business, that's the reason for it. I think that same concept sort of follows through across our entire business, we have enough scale, where I think we can outcompete some of the little localized competitors that we have, it's a pretty fragmented market at that level. And then when we get into more of the competition with the big multinational, in some cases multi-billion dollar companies out there were designed for great quality, flexibility and design and fast turn kinds of business.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " \"And then just diving in since looks like things are going pretty well at C Enterprises you mentioned, could you kind of help make sense, I mean it seems like a pretty bargain basement purchase price, if I'm correct, it's like $600,000 but they're doing $7 million in revenue in just this quarter alone, they did over three like why was that such a bargain?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"We talked some about that at the time of the deal. And I think the ownership and leadership team there, we had some good, some good conversations and recognize that in combination with a larger entity and sharing some of the strategies and go-to-market capabilities specifically from a distribution perspective, which is generally how they go-to-market, that together maybe we were stronger than separate. So I think we've invested in some additional resources there which allows them to perform, the sales team did a great job of dragging in some additional levels of business.\",\n",
       " \"And I just think generally that team has benefited from having some investment being a part of something bigger. Yes, I mean we, by all accounts, I think it was a -- it was a great deal. But I think there was a business that was roughly breakeven, when we acquired it, and we needed to do some investments. And we were happy to do that and thankful as the way that they're performing.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " 'Excellent, that provides some clarity. And then aside from the scale, could you talk a little bit about from a strategic perspective, what C Enterprises brings to the company regarding your new customers or product offerings?',\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, it’s a great question. So I think on the customer side, we've done business for a very long time with a lot of different distributors, we've beefed up our distribution approach even before doing the acquisition, two of their largest customers or two distributors that we've done business with for years and have just recently in the last couple of years started to really grow.\",\n",
       " \"So I think that the relationships that they had with those two largest distributors are very helpful for us. It gave us spread us out a little bit from a customer perspective into some additional big relationships. And on the product side, it gave us more of a fast turn fiber offer than what we've traditionally done. Our Cables Unlimited Group that came in through an acquisition several years ago, eight or nine years ago is great at fiber Corning Gold House just like C Enterprises is. But I think most of their work is on the custom side, higher ticket items that require more engineering. C Enterprises gives us that fast turn book and ship kind of business that goes into some more traditional applications, data centers, traditional telco, those kinds of things, as well as the capability to do fast turn small cell fiber offerings, which is something that we believe will give us a nice opportunity going forward as the spend increases there.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " \"And good to see the backlog numbers here at $10 million, just historically like, what's the company's time to deliver right on that fast turns typically, I would think?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Well, it depends. I think if you go back to two years ago, when I started here, our backlog was traditionally $2.5 million, we just didn't disclosed it because it was not a material number. And if you took that and put it out over the course of the year, magically, that ended up being about a monthly kind of turn or a little more than that. I think now we see ours is built both with things that are going to go out in the next quarter. And if you go back four or five quarters, you kind of see the trend where we generally ship out our backlog. And then some because we have the book and ship business.\",\n",
       " \"But the backlog never goes fully away, we have some of that, some portion of that, that is long standing and gets drawn against over the course of several months or a few quarters. Generally though, whatever is in our backlog will go out within the fiscal year. So that's why I'm pleased to see that we're, we're booking new business and sort of backfilling that backlog every quarter at least for the last six or eight quarters.\",\n",
       " 'Josh Nichols',\n",
       " \"And then, just because you mentioned it for small cell been a big longer term growth opportunity like where's that now as far as today but the piece of business and where do you think that's going to be with the 5G rollout and transition over the next like 24 months or so?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, I think it's a small piece of our business today. We shipped some of our traditional coaxial offer into it. We're working on some fiber fed small cell opportunities today. I think the spend there is interesting because the local legislation comes into play. I think if you were to ask any carrier trying to deploy small cells, the design different location to location both because there may be different technical requirements, but also because local municipalities and local legislation isn't making it particularly easy to deploy those in a fast way. So I expect that to accelerate. I think certain cities and counties have found ways to streamline that process but\",\n",
       " \"I don't expect that the real spend there to start freeing up until next year is the hope, although we see opportunities here and there for different designs, and I think it still seems to be hung up and a lot of the political conversation around wireless and it look okay, is it safe? Some of those conversations that have proven out many times that it's safe, but that still drives a lot of the local conversation which delays it.\",\n",

Some of their product lines are more commoditized maybe than some of the other ones that we've traditionally had. We knew that going in and I think the team there has done a great job of finding the better opportunities that you know, we get paid for the value that I think we deserve, and the fast turn business and the work that that team does. So we're expecting it to come up a little bit. I don't think we expect an overnight massive change and they're not terribly low, Martin. They're not horrible, but when that -- when the performance there is as strong as it was, it's going to have an impact on obviously the average overall.\",\n",
       " \"So we've seen it come up a little bit, I think we're expecting it to continue coming up a few percentage points is kind of our goal at this point to really test and see what's possible both on the existing products but also as we move into some additional applications.\",\n",

And on the overall company obviously besides to the C Enterprises, it seems sounds like in the legacy business, there was reduction to gross margins quarter based on investments in capacity.

       " \"Well, so yes on the gross line, it’s little easier to talk about on that. And I think it's not unlike what we've talked about previously, that 30% or low 30s is a good spot for us with the product mix that we have today. I think as I said on the prior call, when asked kind of a long-term question, How high can the number go? Look, I think getting it up into the low 30s is a solid place with the product mix that we have today, as that mix changes, because our goal is to bring in additional higher margin product lines and drive opportunities in those spaces both organically as well as on the acquisition side.\",\n",
       " \"I think we can keep those margins back up there, 30% and above in the short term, long-term, I don't definitively know this quarter was a great example of when we performed really, really well in a couple of key customer accounts and or product lines, the customer happen to order some things that have that had a lower margin, if the mix has been a little different, those margins could have been up at that 30% number. So it's harder to put a long-term number in place. But I think our goal remains to stay 30% or above. And this quarter was an example of we did some investments on the production side, assuming that we're going to keep driving growth, not just short term, but going long-term.\",\n",
       " \"And we're going to have to have the right kind of people in place on the production teams to do that. Some of that was state mandated as well. We happen to be in locations where wage pressure is being mandated, which that's fine. It's built in there.

And we've got some meaningful things in our pipeline, it's got come down to timing really, my expectation and I think what we’ve seen with C Enterprises is I'm having a harder time calling that inorganic growth, the more days that go by and then being a part of the company where we're doing a good job of sharing business between the various locations and kind of traditional different sales models. They've done a nice job of working together both with the other West Coast business as well as the East Coast operations.

So sometimes it comes down to timing as to when they're going to make payments and when we receive the cash, so if you would also notice, we have I think $2,000 of bad debt over the first nine months, so the collections not an issue, we’ve not had that in the past.

I mentioned sales structure, we're going to get a little further down the path of getting our distribution sales teams operating more closely together. Because traditionally, while we may have called on some of the same customers, talking to completely different groups in some cases, so I think getting those relationships more centralized and getting us set up in a way that it makes it easier for our customers who do business with us.

In the short term, slightly longer term, I think we've done a decent job on getting shared business moving between the locations, but there's probably some operational opportunities but just with similar kinds of production capabilities on both coasts that we can likely leverage out of that as well.\",\n",

       " \"Okay, thank you, Rob. So drilling down on the C Enterprises, margins again. You're talking about gross profit margins are a bit less than then the rest of RF Industries. If you looked at net income profit margins, which maybe you don't even breakout or take by yourself, but regarding C Enterprises, is that also a little bit below or is that or is C Enterprises indeed showing at net loss?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, we don't necessarily break it out that way. But I'll give you a general answer, which is that that business is profitable for us at this point. And when we did the acquisition, we said we expected it to be immediately accretive through some things that we put in place to allow that and just allocation of the right people. And that continues to be the case. So that's a money making operation for us in this quarter, but it's been great for us through the roughly four and a half months that we've had them on board.\",\n",

       " \"So I guess my first question is about salaries, it seems that it has a bit of a negative leverage here because we had great, great revenues, but since salaries seems to have gone up in the revenues, and that's both in the cost of goods sold and in the various operating expenses. So is it, I mean, I understand San Diego is kind of an expensive place to live. But is that kind of like a one-time step function due to certain legal changes? Or is that something to continue, would we be able to get positive leverage in the future?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, so fair question and versus it being salary changes, most of the increases that we experienced show up on a gross margin line, because it's our production folks. So primarily hourly workers and in some cases, there have not been increases there in a few years, frankly. And so I think what you've seen is we've gone through increases that all locations to try to get people at the right market level, in many cases well above the mandatory minimum wage that exists in that location.\",\n",
       " \"There are further mandates over the course of the next few years in multiple places where we do have operations. But I think we've done a decent job of investing correctly in the people to allow us to grow the revenue line and keep up and these are the folks that are doing the actual production work on cable assemblies in particular, whether that's fiber or coax, or a combination thereof. So I think you did see a step change function in this quarter is now built into our gross margin line. And it's incumbent upon us to perform well, price things right and reclaim that margin level that we believe we deserve.\",\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst',\n",
       " 'All right. Is there opportunities to use automation to kind of the decrease the percentage of like human labor costs?',\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, so we've done a decent amount of that, I think it depends on the business, the word Custom showing up in any kind of our operation, sort of lends itself to there's a certain level of automation, but not everything can be automated. So I think we've done a decent job of automating what we can, when I first got here, that was something I was on a quest to go find who has an automated completely, and the issue pops up that, you can automate it for a million of the exact same thing, when you do 100 of the same thing and then change to something else, the ROI on that upfront investment becomes pretty tough to pull off. So there may come a scale level where we find an opportunity to do that again, but I think today we're generally kind of looking at the automation that we can do is already built into the bulk of the business.\",\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst',\n",
       " \"All right, and so in general, would you say that the trend in the industry is for going in your favor for more different, more customized solutions? Or is it, is it the case that sort of customized solutions have been tried out now? And then in the near future, they'll become like, kind of a large scale homogenous deployment?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"Yes, I think the scale of custom deployments, I don't see people planning better. And I say that because that that points itself to the fast turn business as well, there’s a custom part, which is you need 50, or 100, or 200, or something, or maybe you need 10. That's one component. The other is, and I needed in three days, in seven days, in 10 days, whatever the time frame might be, those two things combined, I don't think you're going to go away anytime soon, as I was leaving our office earlier today, for example there was a gentleman picking up cable assemblies, because he's got a job that he has to do and install on for a carrier, that pickup business and the availability for a contractor to back a truck, load it up with what he needs and get out and do the work doesn't seem to be changing and what small cells, if anything, I feel like it's going to get that much more so into a fast turn place in order, needs to be ready in a few days, and then available at the right location.\",\n",
       " \"So I feel like at least a portion of the business is going to stay the way that it is now, I think if we're talking both deployments, somebody wants to buy a million feet of fiber optic cable, that's not a space that we play in. And those will continue to be a large scale deal that gets deployed over the course of several years versus site by site where 100 sites, there may be two that are the same. And the rest of them are varied in nature which fits very well into our skill set.\",\n",
       " 'Unidentified Analyst',\n",
       " \"All right. That's good to hear. And, lastly book-to-bill ratio below one and I asked this question last quarter as well. I assume this is nothing to worry about just because your business is a lot of like short term models quickly fulfilled. So the kind of the book-to-bill ratio is not something that signifies what will happen the next quarter. Is that still correct?\",\n",
       " 'Rob Dawson',\n",
       " \"That's correct. Yes, it points the nature of our business, it is going to be booked and shipped in a very short period of time, which will throw off those kinds of ratios, but the best way to look at kind of the health of the business, our backlog remains strong. And this was another example as this quarter ended, where if the motors had to come in two, three, five days earlier than our backlog would have been even higher at quarter end, instead it ended at eight and then subsequent, it's popped back up to 10 again. So keeping by us disclosing our level of bookings in a quarter and where that leaves us for a backlog, we feel like we're being really transparent on kind of the health of the business around those various metrics.\",\n",
