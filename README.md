# Transcript-Analysis

The goal of this project is to try to glean insights off of earnings call transcripts to aid in the discretionary research process. It is meant to be exploratory in nature. 

There will be 2 main steps

	1. Scrape earnings call transcripts off of Seeking Alpha's website using Scrapy. 

	2. Use NLP (Spacy & NLTK) to analyze transcripts. 

One thing I am interested in, is seeing if Spacy or NLTK is able to group different industries together by using unique words/phrases mentioned in the transcripts. (i.e. refiners using words/phrases such as "crack spreads","gasoline","barrels", etc.)
