      "[['Herman Miller, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLHR)  Q1 2020 Results Earnings Conference Call  September 19, 2019  9:30 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Kevin Veltman - VP, IR & Treasurer', 'Andi Owen - President and Chief Executive Officer ', 'Jeff Stutz - Chief Financial Officer', 'John McPhee - President, Retail business', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Budd Bugatch - Raymond James', 'Steven Ramsay - Thompson Research', 'Matt McCall - Seaport Global', 'Greg Burns - Sidoti & Company', 'Operator', \"Good morning, and welcome to the Herman Miller's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\", \"I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kevin Veltman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\", 'Kevin Veltman', 'Good morning, everyone. Joining me today on our first quarter earnings call are Andi Owen, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stutz, our Chief Financial Officer; and John McPhee, President of our Retail business.', \"We have posted yesterday's press release on our Investor Relations website at hermanmiller.com. Some of the figures that we'll cover today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the GAAP to non-GAAP amounts in a supplemental file that can also be accessed on the website.\", 'Before we begin our prepared remarks, I will remind everyone that this call will include forward-looking statements. For information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements, please refer to the earnings press release we issued last night as well as our annual and quarterly SEC filings.', \"At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. Today's call is scheduled for 60 minutes and we ask that callers limit their questions to no more than three to allow time for all to participate.\", \"With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andi.\", 'Andi Owen', \"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin the call with highlights of our quarterly results, followed by sharing progress that we've made in our strategic priorities. \", 'In the first quarter, we built on our momentum from last quarter by starting the fiscal year with strong growth in sales and orders, led by our North America and Retail businesses. Consolidated sales grew 8% organically over last year, while orders were up 7%. We were especially pleased to continue generating positive results in the face of the ongoing global trade tension and tackling a broader geopolitical environment. ', \"Looking ahead, we're also seeing healthy levels of project opportunities in the pipeline. We've been encouraged to have more and more discussions with their customers about how we can assist in their efforts around attracting and retaining talent and help them design flexible, high performing workplaces. These discussions often highlight the power of the entire Herman Miller Group of brands to meet those needs. \", 'Complementing the growth in sales and orders, we posted improved gross margins this quarter, which were up 70 basis points over the same quarter last year. At the same time, our team continued to manage operating expenses very well. The combination of these factors helped drive another quarter of operating margin expansion with reported operating margins of 160 basis points above the same quarter last year, and adjusted operating margins that were higher by 90 basis points. ', 'We reported earnings per share on a GAAP basis of $0.81 during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share of $0.84 reflected an increase of 22% over the same quarter last year. ', \"On the strategy front, we remain focused on the four strategic priorities that we shared at our May Investor Event. Let me summarize them briefly for you. First, we're being very intentional about unlocking the power of one Herman Miller to help leverage our amazing portfolio of brands and global capabilities to their fullest. Second, we're building a customer oriented and digitally enabled business model aimed at reaching our aspirations in both the contracts and retail spaces. Third, we have clear opportunities to accelerate profitable growth in each of our business segments. And finally, we believe now is the right time to reinforce our commitment to our people, our planet, and to our communities in a more integrated and deliberate way than ever before. \", \"I'd like to share a few highlights of our progress over the last quarter. Our new digital platform to help our North American contract dealers to visualize our product offerings across all of our brands, remains in an excellent adoption curve. Our dealer network users created over 50% more projects than last quarter with the new tool and that's created over 3,500 projects since it was launched to support their selling efforts. \", \"As a next step in this rollout, we'll expand these capabilities in the EMEA region by the end of the fiscal year. This is just one of the ways that we are looking across our entire operation to ensure that we're easy to do business with for our customers, our dealers and our architect and design partners. Our profitability improvement initiative continues to gain traction as one of the key drivers in our aim to accelerate profitable growth. \", \"As we evaluate our progress to-date, we're seeing greater potential for savings and are increasing our savings target. Our original aim for $30 million to $40 million of growth savings has been revised to a target of $40 million to $45 million. We expect to achieve this run rate by the end of fiscal 2020 and finish the first quarter with an annual run rate savings of $36 million. \", 'As a reminder, in addition to supporting bottom-line improvement, these savings are also aimed at helping fund growth initiatives and offsetting inflationary pressures such as tariff.', 'We have a long history of seeking to create a positive and sizable impact for our people, planet and the communities that we serve, while at the same time creating value for our customers and our shareholders. As a result, we were encouraged by the recent business roundtable statement on the purpose of corporations to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders. We have a number of initiatives and working on around those priorities. ', \"For example, we've been exploring the potential for a broader plan around reducing and ultimately eliminating our use of single use plastics across our entire organization. As an initial step, we largely limited single use water bottles across our corporate offices. I've got to mention, John McPhee has joined us today to share more about our growth trajectory for the Retail business. \", 'So let me turn the call over to John to provide some additional background.', 'John McPhee', 'Thank you, Andi. With sales growth of over 10% last year and 12% this quarter, the Retail business has been and continues to be a growth engine for Herman Miller. Importantly, there are a number of initiatives that we believe will help continue that momentum. First, our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Batavia, Ohio, was fully operational at the end of the first quarter.', \"While this transition has required short-term investments the past couple of quarters, it better positions our business to provide enhanced service and reliability to our customers over the long-term. At the same time, the license that we acquired last year for the rights to bring the HAY design brand to North America is gaining traction. After establishing a HAY e-commerce site last year and opening the first two HAY studios in North America, we will be opening our third HAY studio early this quarter, which will be located in the Lincoln Park area of Chicago. HAY's product line has been an important contributor to our growing Design Within Reach contract business, as its furniture designs are great fit for the residential styles but more offices are including in their floor plans. \", 'In addition to our early efforts for the HAY brand, we opened three new Design Within Reach studios in the fourth quarter last year. While still in the early days, these studios represent promising locations for our brand and are off to a good start. ', \"One area where we've experienced pressure on our gross margins is related to net shipping costs. A major source of this pressure comes from growing consumer expectations that the products they purchase should come with free delivery. Compounding this issue is the fact that over the past several months we've experienced increasing costs from freight providers. To help address this, we are currently piloting a range of shipping models, where we expect to gain important knowledge over the coming months about how to better position product and delivery pricing for our space. \", 'On the cost front, we are in the midst of evaluating strategic sourcing strategies and optimizing our outlet store footprint and minimize shipping costs related to returns. ', \"Finally, we've been building new capabilities across our team with recent additions to our sales and marketing leadership team, bringing fresh perspectives compared with our existing knowledge of the market, while we are partnering closely with our Chief Digital Officer to build new digital capabilities including initial work around optimizing our e-commerce platforms, and mapping customer journeys, with a goal of finding ways to make the buying process as seamless as possible for our customers. \", \"On the profitability side, our investments in our new distribution center, ramping up HAY and the initial drives on earnings from studios that have been opened less than a year and related pre-opening costs were an estimated $5.5 million during the quarter. Even after considering these short-term investments, our operating performance is not where we want it to be and we are laser focused on driving operating margin improvement in this business. As we continue to lean into scaling the business, we see the opportunity over time for high-single-digit operating margins for our Retail business. At the same time, I'm energized by the passion that our Retail team who each and every day are making authentic modern design accessible to our customers. \", \"With that Retail overview, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff for a further discussion of our financial results in the quarter. \", 'Jeff Stutz', 'Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Consolidated net sales in the first quarter of $671 million were 7% above the same quarter last year on a GAAP basis, and up 8% organically after adjusting for the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign currency rates. New orders in the period of $677 million were 7% above last year. Within our North America Contract segment, sales were $458 million in the first quarter, representing an increase of 9% from last year. New orders were $468 million and a quarter, up 10% over last year. ', 'Order growth in North America was broad-based across all project size categories, and from a sector standpoint, was led by business services, information technology, and the U.S. Federal Government, partially offset by lower demand in healthcare and financial sectors. ', \"Our International Contract segment reported sales of $114 million in the quarter, a decrease of 1% compared to last year on a reported basis and slightly above last year organically. New orders of $117 million were 7% below the same quarter last year on a reporting basis and 5% lower organically. I think it's important to note that the International business faced challenging growth comparisons for the quarter. To put this in perspective, in the first quarter of last year the International business posted organic sales and order growth of 22% and 14% respectively. \", 'We believe this is important context for you to consider as you evaluate the performance of our International business this quarter. To be clear, this business has been a key contributor to our growth in recent years, both on a top and bottom-line perspective. And tough comparisons aside, it factors heavily into our strategy for driving continued growth in the future. ', 'With that background, lower year-over-year demand levels were experienced in the EMEA region, as well as India, while we’ve continued to see growth in the rest of Asia Pacific, Mexico and Brazil. ', 'Our Retail business segment reported sales in the quarter of $99 million, an increase a 12% from the same quarter last year. New orders for the quarter of $92 million were 11% ahead of last year and sales growth for the quarter was primarily driven by growth from Design Within Reach contract, the HAY brand, new studios and outlet stores. ', 'As John mentioned earlier, the first quarter reflected investments in new studio growth, a new warehouse and launching the HAY brand, all of which are initiatives that we expect will support continued sales growth and improved operating margins as we move forward. ', 'From a currency translation perspective, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to year ago levels was a headwind to sales growth this quarter. We estimate the translation impact from the year-over-year changes in currency rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated net sales of approximately $2 million in the period. Consolidated gross margins in the first quarter were 36.7%, which reflect an increase from 36% in the same quarter last year. This gross margin expansion was driven by manufacturing leverage on higher production volumes, favorable price realization and lower steel costs, along with our ongoing profit improvement initiatives. These benefits helped mitigate gross margin pressures at the consolidated level from tariffs and within our Retail business from increased net freight expenses and transition costs related to the new distribution center. ', 'Operating expenses in the first quarter were $184 million compared to $178 million in the same quarter last year. The current quarter included $400,000 of special charges related to the vesting of key employee incentive expenses associated directly with our CEO transition. By comparison, we recorded special charges totaling $5 million in the first quarter last year. Exclusive of these items, the year-over-year increase in operating expenses of $11 million resulted mainly from higher variable selling expenses and costs in our Retail business related to occupancy, marketing and stacking for new Retail studios, and the launch of the HAY brand in North America. ', 'Restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of $1.8 million related to actions associated with our profit improvement initiatives, including an early retirement program initiated last quarter within North America and facility consolidation projects in the UK and China. On a GAAP basis, we reported operating earnings of $60 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $46 million in the year ago period. ', 'Excluding restructuring and other special charges, adjusted operating earnings this quarter were $62 million, or 9.3% of sales. And by comparison, we reported adjusted operating income of $52 million or 8.4% of sales in the first quarter last year. And the effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%. ', 'And then finally, net earnings in the first quarter totaled $48 million or $0.81 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $36 million or $0.60 per share in the same quarter a year ago.', 'Excluding the impact of restructuring and other special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter totaled $0.84 compared to adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share in the first quarter of last year. ', \"With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give us an update on our cash flow and balance sheet. \", 'Kevin Veltman', 'Thanks, Jeff. Before I review our cash flow and balance sheet highlights, let me start with a brief overview of a recent refinancing transaction. Effective on August 28th, we refinanced our existing revolving credit facility. As part of this transaction, we upsized our revolver by $100 million from $400 million to $500 million, and extended the maturity of the facility by 5 years to August of 2024. After this transaction, the available capacity on our facility stood at $265 million at the end of the quarter. ', 'With that background, let me move to commentary on the first quarter. We ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $160 million, which was slightly higher than the cash on hand last quarter. Cash flows from operations in the first quarter were $53 million, reflecting an increase of 60% over the same quarter of last year. Increased earnings were the primary driver of higher operating cash flows in the quarter. ', 'Capital expenditures were $90 million in the quarter. Cash dividends paid in the quarter were $12 million. As a reminder, last quarter, we announced an increase of 6% in our quarterly dividend rate that will be paid beginning in October. This increase brings our expected annual payout level to approximately $49 million. We also continued our share repurchase program with repurchases of $8 million during the quarter. ', 'We remain in compliance with all debt covenants. And as of quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was approximately 0.9 to 1. Given our current cash balance, ongoing cash flow from operations and total borrowing capacity, we remain well positioned to meet the financing needs of our business moving forward. ', \"With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff to cover our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\", 'Jeff Stutz', 'Okay. Thank you, Kevin. We expect sales in the second quarter fiscal 2020 to range between $685 million and $705 million. The midpoint of this range implies an organic revenue increase of 7% compared to the same quarter last fiscal year. We expect consolidated gross margin in the second quarter to range between 36.6% and 37.6%. This midpoint gross margin forecast is 100 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflecting improved production leverage, lower steel prices and net benefits from our ongoing profit improvement initiatives. ', 'Operating expenses in the second quarter are expected to range between $189 million and $193 million. We anticipate earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.89 per share in the period and our assumed effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 23%. ', \"With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and we'll take your questions.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James. Your line is open. ', 'Budd Bugatch ', \"Good morning, Andi. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Kevin. A couple of questions if I could. Let's talk a little bit about gross margin, it's most notable in terms of segments. In the Retail segment, you addressed it qualitatively and perhaps directionally. But can we get a little more clarity on maybe some data on the impact of commodities, tariffs and what's the new distribution center transition costs would be called out for? And what that looks like going forward for the next quarter and the next couple of quarters?\", 'Jeff Stutz', \"Hey, Budd, this is Jeff. I'll start. John is here, so chime in John with any color you have. So -- and just to clarify Budd, you want to -- just Retail or you want to get a sense for cost price pressures and benefits for the consolidated group?\", 'Budd Bugatch ', 'Both if I could. I mean we -- with this segment model within the company and we obviously like to carry that forward with -- for consolidated results. ', 'Jeff Stutz', \"Yes. So let me start with the consolidated numbers, Budd, then we can talk -- we can kind of dig into a few comments on the Retail segment. So for the quarter -- I'll talk year-over-year, I'll just give you kind of a walkthrough of some of the major drivers on the gross margins. All-in-all, we were up about 70 basis points. Tariffs, tariffs pressures on a gross basis, of course, this is before any of the actions that we've taken, which we will be -- I'll cover in some of the other categories here, 90 basis points of pressure year-on-year. \", \"In the Retail business specifically, the impact of the net freight pressures that we referenced on the prepared remarks, about 50 basis points of pressure at the consolidated level. The distribution center move by itself, and John can provide further color on this of course, that's probably another 40 basis points year-on-year on the gross margin, negative. And then offsetting that we had a -- this combination of profit improvement initiatives that we talked a lot about, along with specific pricing actions that have been taken in the business accounted for about 210 basis points of benefit year-on-year. And then steel and commodity prices, also now a help to our gross margins, about 40 basis points of benefit. So I did my math right, that should get you close. \", 'Budd Bugatch ', 'We got 250 of -- this is I’ve taken consolidated, 250 of good guys, and I heard 130 of bad guys. That’s 120. What did I miss? Tariffs remind me the other one of the negative 40 of …', 'Jeff Stutz', \"Let me just walk you through it one more time here quick, just so that we're all on the same page. Tariffs of 90, pressure; freight related expenses in the Retail business, pressure year-on-year of about 50 basis points; the DC moves within the Retail business about 40 basis points; pricing and profit improvement initiatives collectively, benefit year-on-year of about 210; and steel and commodities account for another about 40 basis points of benefit.\", 'Budd Bugatch ', \"Got you. Okay, that's right. I missed the 50 as separate item. Okay. That's very helpful. And going forward, Jeff, how do you think they play out? What happens as you look forward?\", 'Jeff Stutz', \"Yes, sure. So our guide for the second quarter implies kind of the following headline assumptions. Tariffs, we think are -- continue to be a pressure year-on-year, about 60 basis points we would estimate. The freight pressures within the Retail business we think are on the same order of magnitude year-on-year, probably somewhere 50 to 60 basis points of pressure. Pricing and profit initiatives similar as well year-on-year, I’d call it maybe 190 to 200 basis points of benefit, are assumed. Steel and commodities, we can start to see a little bit more benefit from steel and commodity prices, mainly steel-driven. Just if you look at the directional -- the direction of the steel index, it's actually been drifting down. And so we should see about 70 basis points of benefit next quarter. And then, other puts and takes, we -- including mix by the way, probably it’s another 30 basis points of pressure. \", 'So all-in, I think our guide implies about 110 basis points of year-over-year improvement. ', 'Andi Owen', 'And then DC move, the quarterly, that goes away. ', 'Jeff Stutz', \"Correct, the DC move is largely done at this point. And then John, I don't know if you’d add anything to that at all? Any additional color on that?\", 'John McPhee', \"It was a huge undertaking in the quarter. But we moved about 700 containers worth of merchandise, besides the regular ongoing receipts of new goods coming in from the old facility into the new state-of-the-art facility in Batavia, Ohio. I was down there last week. It's up running and really will be a positive going forward, while it was a drain during the quarter.\", 'Budd Bugatch ', \"And so the delta for the transition costs were primarily the freight of moving goods, one from the other that don't repeat, right? That's the -- that was the -- that’s the nature of the costs?\", 'John McPhee', \"That would be one of the elements. We also of course, on a GAAP basis, were paying double rent. So we're paying rent on the old facility and the new facility. And just with the cost of getting everything put away and into the new locations. So all the subs mold with that move. But we are completely out of the old facility at this point and fully operational. We'd love to have you see at some point out of the new facility. \", 'Budd Bugatch ', 'And is there a delta in depreciation now that the new facility is up and operational? How does that work?', 'Jeff Stutz', \"Yes, Budd. There is going to be some additional depreciation drag. It's included in the guide. I don't have that number off the top of my head. It's going to be incremental, a bit higher than the old as you would imagine.\", 'Budd Bugatch ', \"Okay. Just a couple of other questions. I know, I'm going to limit myself to three I think. The digital efforts which is obviously of interest to many investors. How is that working in the Retail side? Can you give us some color of the mix of e-commerce business, what are you seeing on that mix? And since DWR is both a retail business and ultimately, maybe some contracts, can you give us some flavor as to how those revenues and profitability are working? Because obviously, the profitability is a major issue.\", 'Andi Owen', \"Yes. And hey, Budd, let me start off with a little bit on the digital transformation efforts. And then I'll turn it over to John. We don't break out this business in segments. So I'll say that we've kicked off a really large scale effort to upgrade our e-commerce experience. So starting with customer journeys, improved functionalities whether that’s new visualization, configuration capabilities, and also expanding our e-commerce presence across the brands and geographies. So this is pretty major undertaking and that is underway. We're also on the contract side looking at continued adoption of [MRL] and we'll continue, as I said, in our prepared remarks, expand internationally. We're also looking at launching two separate data analytics senior positions and data analyst capabilities. \", \"So along with the improved e-commerce presentation and stage, we'll also have a larger and much more capable data analytics team to back that up. And then we are looking at A/B testing right now for help with our retail shipping models, but we evaluate shipping freight and shipping revenue. We're testing a variety of things to determine what our next steps are going to be there.\", \"And then also looking at new pricing platform and products platform. So loading all of our products into one database, so that we can easily access them across all of our brands and then looking at ways that we can price more quickly. So there is additional effort around e-commerce that is far-reaching, improving our customer experience, improving our speed, improving our presence to the customer, understanding our customer better. And then there's also the IT backbone investment that we're making around products, that we're making around how we interact with our dealers on the contract side of the business.\", \"As far as the e-commerce side of the business in retail versus the bricks-and-mortar side, obviously e-commerce is growing as in every other retailer at a large rate and we continue to think that HAY will be a very, very, very important e-commerce presence. So we continue to expect to see growth in both of those areas. And John, I don't know if you’d add to that.\", 'John McPhee ', \"Yes, I would just say that we're looking for both quick wins and long-term wins. And so, we're implementing at the end of this month a series of changes to the dwr.com site first. And then based upon success there, we'll be rolling that out across our other platforms hermanmiller.com and hay.com. And then there's other projects that will take a little bit longer. And as Andi mentioned, going to one Herman Miller and being able to share a product information seamlessly across our businesses will be a huge advantage going forward.\", 'Budd Bugatch ', \"Okay. I'm sure others will get into more -- trying to get more specifics on the e-com side. Just last from me, Kevin, you did talk about the new revolver. Any changes to interest structure -- interest rate structure on any of that debt commitment fee differential, the rate differential?\", 'Kevin Veltman ', \"Yes, the new deal -- so we upsized it by $100 million to provide more liquidity. Our interest grid improved a bit in a couple of spots. We're at the spot, we're at on the grid. It'll be roughly the same going forward from an interest expense perspective.\", 'Budd Bugatch ', \"And anything on the commitment fee since you've upsized it? Do you have more interest expense from that?\", 'Kevin Veltman ', 'The amounts were somewhat similar to what we paid last time on a larger deal. So the basis points came down a bit. So that will flow through at a pretty similar run rate.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ramsay with Thompson Research. Your line is open.', 'Steven Ramsey ', 'I wanted to start with the specialty, the old specialty segment inclusion in North America, how the turnaround in those units is going. I mean, clearly, good to see a strong result from the whole segment when you include the old segment in. So just trying to get color on the headwind of those segments and the benefit if there was improvement?', 'Jeff Stutz ', \"Hey, Steven. This is Jeff. I'll start with a few comments and then certainly Andi will join in. So I want to be real careful. Hopefully you understand, we're reporting the business on the basis of the combined segment now. So I'm not going to give a ton of detail on the individual businesses. What I will say is, on the contract side, all of these businesses are largely contract focused. And those businesses are continuing to see collectively the kinds of growth rates that we are generally speaking, talking about in total. So good uplift in the majority of those businesses.\", \"As you know, what we -- prior to making the change, we've talked a bit about this on past calls, we have one of our subsidiaries that's healthcare focused that is actually seen pretty good top-line growth in the last -- as we closed last fiscal year, but we were struggling a little bit with kind of getting that translated to bottom-line profitability. Those -- that work is ongoing and we are taking that whole process very seriously, and we've actually made some improvements there. So I'm not going to give you a detailed color on each of those businesses. But I can tell you generally speaking, the businesses reflect the kind of contract growth that we're reporting in total.\", 'Andi Owen ', \"Yes, I would say, we see nice growth across all the segments. But to add to that, Steven, what we've also seen as we think about one Herman Miller and we bring all of these contract partners under one leader and one sales force, it’s how we're showing up to the customer, how we're showing up to the A&B community. We've really simplified our approach and we've made it easier for them to access many of these brands, and in some cases I think built awareness that we are all part of one group. So, I think that piece of ease of operation and efficiency is definitely showing up across the board.\", 'Steven Ramsey ', 'Excellent. And then -- I know this is a sensitive topic, but maybe high level, you can talk to any resistance to pricing and getting pricing in recent months? It seems from -- not necessarily peers but various companies and different channels, some resistance to pricing as further tariffs are being implemented?', 'AndiOwen ', \"None that we've seen it this time.\", 'Steven Ramsey ', \"Great. And then in International, just thinking about -- on the top-line, was it purely a comps issue or is there any fundamental slowing of demand there? And then on the gross margin improvement, with the slight pullback in sales, is that just a function of mix or is that a function of pricing that you've put through in the past flowing through?\", 'Andi Owen ', \"I would say primarily comps, Steven. If you look at the performance in International in Q1 of last year, the two-year comps are still on the 20s, which we're pretty happy with. We had some very large projects in our EMEA region last year. But one place where we have seen slowdown, which is no surprise, is the UK and that's been happening a while with the Brexit uncertainty. But we still see strong growth in APAC and LatAm and we have overall a lot of confidence in our international businesses.\", \"From a gross margin perspective and Jeff please add color to that, we've had a lot of efficiency that we've seen from our combination of our manufacturing facilities in Dongguan in Asia. And that's really helped us to capture some increased profitability across the international region as well. And I would just say to shout out to the international team and our teams in general, we've done an excellent job of managing operating expense and profitability this quarter in the face of some really interesting challenges. So I think the team deserves some credit for their ability to turn that profit performance with declining sales.\", 'Jeff Stutz ', \"Yes. Steven, this is Jeff. I thinks that's spot on. One little bit I'd add to that on the gross margin side is, that's a business now where we're seeing -- for a long time that business just didn't have the volume running through the various operations to tell a similar leverage story as we would historically get in our North American manufacturing operations. We're seeing more volume run through the factory now. Their ops teams have done amazing job and I think we're benefiting leverage basis in a way that we have historically as well.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt McCall with Seaport Global. Your line is open.', 'Matt McCall ', \"I actually want to follow up on Steven's questions. So, Jeff, you gave -- when you broke down to Budd about the different buckets of puts and takes, you said 210 basis points from price and profit improvement. What about just price? Did you have price enough to offset your cost if there wasn't any inflation or the tariffs impact, where you price cost positive without the profit improvement effort?\", 'Jeff Stutz ', 'Yes. Yes. ', 'Matt McCall ', 'Okay, I should have followed that up with, if so how much?', 'Jeff Stutz ', 'That’s no.', 'Matt McCall ', \"That's why I asked it. Sorry, yes but -- so what was the price cost benefit? And then when you think about the price cost outlook, just given what you said about steel, what does that turn into, just the pricing side?\", 'Jeff Stutz ', 'Yes. Probably 100 basis points of the number I gave you, also net of the tariff impact.', 'Matt McCall ', 'And is that -- so that the -- that was the Q1. What about in the guide?', 'Jeff Stutz ', 'Of the same order magnitude, Matt.', 'Matt McCall ', \"So maybe, Andi, you mentioned a comment on the business roundtable. I think the actual metric yesterday wasn't as encouraging and we've actually written some of things about some of the macro factors we're watching. But clearly, you guys are not seeing the impact of that. Can you talk of -- and it sounds like the pipeline is good. So can you talk about -- why is the -- why is that not more concerning? It doesn't sound like you're calling out any indications of concern from your dealers, anything like that. Why is the -- what do you think is driving the strength, despite what appears to be a little bit of a moderation in the macro?\", 'Andi Owen ', \"I think what we're still hearing in there, now the customers and the A/B community all the time. We're still hearing that the work for talent is really contributing to people looking at their workplaces, people understanding how they can provide places that people want to work. We aren't seeing a slowdown there. Some of it looks good in a short-term basis and a long-term basis, there are A&B partners, even architectural billings have been down slightly. If you look at the long-term in the last six months to 12 months, we aren't seeing indicators out there that are concerning to us right now. Now, obviously, as everyone else is doing, we're watching carefully. But right now, we really feel to work for talent. We really feel American companies and consumers are strong. Jeff, you have something to add?\", 'Jeff Stutz ', \"No, I think that's right. It's exactly right.\", 'Matt McCall ', \"And then I guess the -- two more quick ones. The SG&A outlook, it looks like there's a little deleveraging on a year-over-year basis implied, if we did our math right? Is anything you want to call out or explain there, or did we do our math wrong?\", 'Jeff Stutz ', \"No, I think you're right, Matt. I think there's a couple of things. Number one, we're off to a good start on the fiscal year. So expect -- and again, this is year-over-year, I assume your math is based on. There's going to be some drag from instead of bonus accruals, assuming we can keep the pace, right? That won't be earned if we don't earn it. It won't be paid if we don't earn it. But right now, that's what the guide implies. That's part of the answer.\", \"I think in fairness to -- some of this is, as Andi alluded to some of the investment we're making on various digital fronts, all actions that we think are mission critical to the strategic direction of the company, some of that is going to require some incremental investment and I think that's what would represent the balance of what you're seeing largely.\", 'Andi Owen ', 'Yes, for sure.', 'Matt McCall ', 'Okay. And then last one. The take -- you took your targeted savings or your savings target up. What drove that change? What changed with your outlook?', 'Jeff Stutz ', 'Yes, Matt. This is Jeff again. It kind of alludes to pricing. I think our pricing realization has lot -- has been a bit better than we had earlier anticipated. And as a result of that, that really accounts for the majority of the difference.', 'Matt McCall ', 'Okay. So pricing is lumped down with the profit improvement efforts?', 'Jeff Stutz ', \"There are -- this is where -- that's why I lumped them together in my walk, Matt, because there are certain pricing actions that we've taken that I would classify kind of act outside of the specific profit initiatives that we've been talking about. But at the end of the day, some of our profit improvement initiatives have been very directly associated with price actions. And so it's a little hard to draw the bright line in between the two. We've somewhat considered them collectively in our internal and how we’ve operated the business internally. So that's why I lumped them together. But yes, there are some in both buckets.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.', 'Greg Burns ', \"Just had a question about the retail demand trends. We've seen the -- it looks like the comp -- the comparable brand sales of -- the growth there has slowed down a little bit. So I just wanted to get your view on the outlook for growth in the Retail segment. And if you think you can kind of maintain the current pace, given that the comparable brand sales have been a bit lower than reported revenue growth? Thanks.\", 'John McPhee ', 'Greg, hi, this is John McPhee. So one of the things with the DC move was, it slowed our deliveries during the quarter, which impacts future sales going forward, right? We had to publish that due to the transition, our delivery times would be a little longer than historically they would have been. And so, we had some pressure there. But overall, I believe the trend is positive and certainly having the move behind us will allow our team to put 100% of their focus back on selling. So that should be positive going forward.', 'Greg Burns ', \"Okay. And then from a profitability perspective for that segment, I know that the DC move is behind you, so maybe some of the duplicate costs are rolling off. But what's your view on, what your profit outlook for that segment of the business for the remainder of the year? Do you foresee that getting back to positive operating earnings sometime this year? Thank you.\", 'Jeff Stutz ', \"Hey, Greg, this is Jeff. Yeah. So we outlined a number of things that we -- in our prepared remarks that we feel are temporary pressures in the business. Among them is the kind of near-term items that are, I think, behind us related to the DC move. There's some additional costs that I would characterize as they will be ongoing and we will ramp into improved profitability as we begin to leverage them. We talked about investment in the launch of the HAY brand as an example. The effect of having six stores today that are -- that weren't in place a year ago at this time and the fairly well documented data across our store portfolio would suggest that, that takes a period of time for those stores to mature. And so, if you factor all of those out, we think going forward our guide for Q2 first of all would imply something closer to breakeven operating margin for the quarter. So let's just be clear on that.\", \"But as we get into the back half of the year, we believe we start to see the ramp up of profitability against some of those investments. We're like closer to 3% to 5% in the back half as we kind of get toward Q4 op margins for that business. And then our job is to continue to ramp it beyond that, and we do believe that that's possible. It will take a little bit of time.\", 'Greg Burns ', 'And then, are your dealers currently selling HAY, do they have access to sell those products yet?', 'Andi Owen ', \"Yes. We localize several families of products throughout the first couple of quarters in a year and they have access to those products, as well as products that we can manufacture, outsource and we're ramping up sales and our dealer network in North America. And that as we work towards expanding, HAY will continue to have that same presence in other countries in the world. But so far, HAY has been very strong.\", 'Greg Burns ', 'And then lastly, you talked about the digital efforts on the Retail side. But on the contract side, what percent of your dealers have adopted those new digital tools? And maybe if you can just give us a little bit of color on the effect it has had on your orders? Like have you been -- have you seen increase in your wallet share, your dealers, at the ones that have adopted the new digital tools? Thank you.', 'Andi Owen ', \"I can't speak to an increase in wallet share at this point. But what I can say is that dealers have adopted it and the majority of our dealers have and will continue to. It's -- again, it's a gradual rollout dealer to dealer. What we've heard from our dealers over time is that we're very complicated to work with and also that it takes a lot of time to visualize and specify our products. What we're hearing from them is that they're saving anywhere from 30% to 60% time. So, it's taking them that much less time to actually design and specify the products, so that's helping them. [Hire a] designers, use the designers they have more effectively, and spend more time with customers. So, we anticipate we will see an increase in wallet share. We also anticipate we'll just see better interactions with our dealers and at more time, the savings from them. And Kevin, would you want to add anything to that?\", 'Kevin Veltman ', \"No, I think the point is, we've definitely hit in North America a pretty good cross-section of the dealer base of certified dealer network, that type of thing. I think that 3,500 products -- projects that had been visualized using this new tool starts to show the adoption. It was up nicely sequentially from last quarter, but we're still only a couple of quarters in. So to Andi's point, the key is freeing up time for our designers and sales people to focus on the customer and spend time with them.\", 'Operator', \"Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Andi Owens for any closing remarks.\", 'Andi Owen ', \"Great. Thanks, Catherine. Thank you all for joining today's call. We will, of course, be back to you in December with a progress update and I hope that you all have a great day.

Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for participating in our first quarter FY 2020 analysts’ call. Let me also thank the hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates around the world who work everyday to keep our purple promise, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.', 'When our strategic management committee presented the FY 2020 business plan to our Board of Directors last spring, we identified three significant challenges to increasing earnings this fiscal year, consistent with our stated long-term goals. One, beginning in the fall of 2018, it had become clear that global trade disputes were adversely affecting manufacturing in Europe and Asia, thereby slowing international shipping demand.', 'Two, our TNT integration was facing its most important phase, leading to the integration of European ground operations by the end of FY 2020. And three, we plan to add capabilities to enhance our services for the rapidly growing e-commerce market, which we expect to grow in the United States from 50 million to 100 million packages per day by 2026. ', 'These shipments will be destined increasingly to residences, and one in four packages will be short distance deliveries. While the backbone of FedEx is the B2B business, our unmatched ground and express line haul and short networks carry both B2B and B2C commerce with great efficiency. The lead in e-commerce we have launched or announced FedEx extra hours and express service which provides nightly pick up with the delivery the next business day.', 'In sourcing FedEx SmartPost packages for FedEx Ground delivery by peak 2020. FedEx Ground six and seven day delivery. Expanding the FedEx Ground oversized package network to approximately 100 facilities by peak 2020, new return services and thousands of additional pickup and shipping points, including $8,000 general onsite locations in less dense areas.', 'And finally, FedEx Freight Direct for heavy and hard to handle items requiring delivery over the threshold, the so called H-3D [ph] market. FedEx can handle millions of additional shipments generated by these new offerings without adding significant additional sortation capacity.', 'It should be noted a large amount of Ground growth will be short haul zone one that will be lower yield, but with improved margin due to increasing density and minimal line haul cost. There is a new video on our website that goes into detail about our broad portfolio and I hope you will watch it. Our services and capabilities and cost will be industry leading in the short haul zone one sector.', 'The FedEx Board of Directors endorse making these moves as FY 2019 came to a close understanding the short-term cost, as we believe by the end of this fiscal year FY 2020, we will have significantly repositioned FedEx for strong future earnings. The market is changing as volumes are moving out of the USPS. And we are in-sourcing more, we have a chart on the IR website that shows these trends.', \"Over the summer, these challenges increased somewhat due to the decision to not renew our largest Amazon contract and deepening trade disputes. While the Amazon contract represented only a small proportion of our revenues, the nature of our business is such that near-term profits will be adversely affected since the last bit of volume has significant flow through to the bottom line. However, we have closed additional business to replace this traffic, which is being onboarded and we are taking out significant costs which were unique to Amazon's requirements.\", 'Also, the global macro economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to reduce capacity. Specifically we will retire 20 MD-10-10 Aircraft over the current and next fiscal year, which will eliminate that fleet type from our air operations.', \"We are highly likely to also retire the remaining 10 A310 aircraft this year, which will also lead to the elimination of that fleet type. In addition, we are parking the equivalent capacity of seven MD-11 aircraft this fiscal year. Accordingly, assuming no recession, we will continue the initiatives announced in May and June with confident optimism about FedEx's long-term future competitive position and industry leadership.\", 'We posted a chart on our website that shows the significant customer correlation among our three core OpCos. Our ability to bundle Express, Ground and Freight services is essential to success in our competitive exosphere. FedEx Office and FedEx Logistics also provide important value added services to our portfolio against the major competitors we face every day.', 'Let me now ask Brie to amplify our views on the marketplace and the economy, then Raj to discuss current operations, including our plans for peak season. And Alan will give you more details on our financials. Then we will take your questions. Brie?', 'Brie Carere', \"Thank you, Fred. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll open with our economic outlook then dive directly into how we're tackling market opportunities and delivering solutions for our customers at FedEx.\", 'Comparing to where we were in June, our overall outlook for U.S. economic growth is down 20 basis points currently at 2.3% for real GDP. Our outlook has changed despite consumer driven growth of 2% in the U.S. in Q2 of CY 2019. This changes because the industrial sector remains sluggish due to an inventory build-up and increased geopolitical trade tensions. As you can see in chart number three on the IR site, U.S. manufacturing PMI has been very weak this year. Given that our industrial production outlook is down 70 basis points from June currently at 0.9%.', \"From a global perspective, economic growth has decreased as the developed world outside of the U.S. sees weaker growth and both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets. In Europe, ongoing decline in Germany's industrial sector is a drag on growth. While uncertainty over Brexit is impacting not just the UK where no sector has been immune to the negative impact, but its major trading partners as well. Growth in Italy remains week with Q2 CY 2019 data showing no gain in real GDP.\", 'In reference to chart four in the presentation, you can see Eurozone manufacturing PMI has been signalling contraction for most of the year. In Asia, Chinese industrial production growth had a 10 year low in July and exports remain week. Chinese exports to the U.S. of the client every month in 2019. More broadly all manufacturer -- excuse me, all major exporting economies have been impacted by the slowdown in trade, especially Asian economies with high exposure to China.', \"I want to highlight that Q2 CY 2019 global trade volumes declined year-over-year, which is the first decline since 2009. This decline coupled with JPMorgan's global PMI manufacturing export orders index falling from 47.5 and August from 49 in May leads us to expect global trade volumes will contrast this year on an annual basis for the first time since 2009.\", 'As we have stressed before, a zero tariff zero subsidy global trade environment is the most powerful economic growth engine there is. We will continue to push for policies that stimulate rather than depressed global trade.', 'Now, turning our focus to what we can control we remained laser focused on executing strategies across three key areas international, ecommerce, and small business. Right now our sights are set on an addressable transportation market totalling $550 billion worldwide. The majority of this opportunity lies outside of the United States where FedEx share has significant opportunity for growth. International is a clear opportunity for us with tremendous runway ahead.', 'As we integrate TNT and lower our costs to serve in Europe, we will be ideally positioned to gain share from the competition, the European team is gaining traction and accelerating the acquisition of parcel customers. Unfortunately, this momentum has been offset by reduction in industry air freight volumes between Europe and the United States.', 'In Europe, we are simplifying our pricing structures and are opening the valve for e-commerce for the first time ever to further stimulate growth. It is important to note that our European competitors have a larger ecommerce volume base, which insulates them from economic headwinds impacting commercial business. We are very excited about the e-commerce potential for our European business.', 'We are also creating new pricing and improving our value proposition between Asia and Europe. This is the largest trade lane in the world. Prior to the TNT acquisition, we did not have the European buyer base to pull this volume from Asia, as European payers make the majority of buying decisions in this lane.', 'Now shifting my focus to e-commerce, in reference to chart five on the IR site. In the U.S. more than 90% of incremental domestic parcel volume from 2018 to 2026 is expected to come from e-commerce period. This is why we are busy building a world class portfolio of solutions to best serve thousands of retailers in this space. We are very proud of the rapid innovation we have brought to e-commerce in the last three years and you can certainly expect more innovation in the months ahead.', \"On this same chart you'll see that more than 50% of the U.S. domestic e-commerce market is our addressable growth market with a CAGR of 12%. As the e-commerce market grows, so does the market for returns up 35% since 2015. Packages dropped off at our retail locations result in a higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency making FedEx even more competitive in the returns market. We're very excited about our network expansion with Dollar General. We will have 1,800 incremental locations open by peak. We also expect our [Technical difficulty] volume to reach a record high this holiday season.\", 'Innovation and customer value are driving every decision we make when it comes to e-commerce. We are very excited about making everyday a delivery day with the launch of our Seven-Day service at FedEx Ground. We are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 26% of the lanes. This move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share.', 'We are also building powerful relationships with many retailers and leveraging solutions like FedEx extra hours, and FedEx Ground zone one which is our local portfolio. Our local portfolio enables retailers to leverage local inventory and stores and DCs to take orders later in the day and still deliver them the next day.', 'We just forged a new strategic delivery partnership with Dick’s Sporting Goods. The majority of their spend with us is on their e-commerce business by leveraging our portfolio of ground commercial, home delivery and express services. They are getting the product to their customers faster, which of course is paramount to them and to their business growth.', 'Another retailer we work closely with is Chewy. Chewy was one of the first home delivery customers that benefited from our Six-Day expansion. Due to their one to two-day shipping commitment and 24x7 operations, they are ready to take full advantage of our new Seven-Day service. Retailers and brands, large and small have recognized our commercial teams for their partnership and for our ability to help them grow their business and successful compete in the market.', \"Also e-commerce will continue to create great opportunities for our LTL business. Our new FedEx Freight Direct service moves large bulky items into consumer's homes and into businesses. Backed by the power of the FedEx brand and the speed and reliability of our nationwide priority network, we are able to reach over 80% of the U.S. population, and we have a unique ability to serve as a large part of this $10 billion market.\", \"And of course, we can't forget about Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, who has recently been in three test markets, Memphis, Tennessee, Plano, Texas and Manchester, New Hampshire. Roxo was preparing to change the way on-demand e-commerce shipments make it to customer's doorsteps.\", 'While these e-commerce investments benefit the broader market, I am particularly excited about how this strategy will support small and medium businesses, who remain our most profitable customers. In FY 2019 our small and medium businesses grew more than 8% and there is still a lot of room to grow as there are more than 32 million small businesses in the U.S.', \"Speaking of being there for small and medium businesses, we will not apply a residential peak surcharge this holiday season, a decision that has received outstanding feedback from countless small and medium sized customers. It's a great way to help make our customers the hero as e-commerce continues to grow and become a major part of their business.\", 'Now let me turn the call over to Raj for his remarks.', 'Raj Subramaniam ', 'Thank you, Brie and good afternoon, everyone. As you are all aware, the global economic and trade environment remains very uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, FedEx remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. We are taking decisive actions to address the three topics that Fred covered in his opening.', 'Number one, reducing capacity, especially in our intercontinental network and overall reduction of costs in our Express business. Number two, completing TNT integration. And number three, leveraging our infrastructure at FedEx Ground and making targeted investment that allow us to successfully go all-in on e-commerce.', 'Let me talk about each of these in turn. First, capacity cuts and overall cost reduction at FedEx Express. We expect the current softness in air cargo demand to continue into calendar year 2020. As such, we will take action to reduce our intercontinental flights after our peak season to better match supply to demand. We have already decreased U.S. domestic flight hours and we will be aggressively looking for additional opportunities.', \"The Express team is intensely focused on overall cost reduction. This includes deferring non-critical hiring, limiting discretionary spending, and implementing structural costs initiatives such as the United States voluntary buyout program. In addition, we're looking at every opportunity to reduce capital spending, benefits from all these changes will be realized in the coming quarters.\", \"Secondly, let me update you on TNT integration. Overall, I'm pleased to report that we have picked up the pace of integration and are continuing to improve our value proposition for our customers. Cross utilization of combined FedEx Express and TNT networks, which we share on our previous calls was a major step toward full integration of the operations. In June, these capabilities expanded across Europe. The transit time for FedEx intra-European economy parcel shipments improved by at least one business day on approximately 40% of the European lanes across the 28 countries in Europe. We are well on our way to achieving full Ground interoperability in our pickup and delivery networks in Europe by the end of May 2020.\", 'Growing intercontinental packages into the combined European Ground network allows us to improve service, while simultaneously reducing our costs to serve. This will help us accelerate growth into Europe from all around the world. Asia-Europe lane, which remains the largest intercontinental trade lane is particularly important in this regard. Given our strong presence in APAC and significantly enhanced presence in Europe, we expect to gain share in this lane in the months and years to come.', 'Additionally, in Q1 we integrated customs clearance and brokerage services in Europe to provide a more seamless experience for our customers. This milestone ensures we are well prepared for Brexit no matter the outcome. Clearance integration is also very important for us to enable cross utilization of TNT road network for intercontinental shipments. And as mentioned on the previous call, Sales integration is practically complete. And now we are presenting a single phase to our customers nearly everywhere around the world.', 'And thirdly, e-commerce, Fred and Brie have discussed our robust portfolio. Let me now address the enhancements specifically underway within FedEx Ground, which is the backbone of our e-commerce strategy. FedEx Ground continues to transform the package delivery business in response to a growing market demand. Network investments including seven-day residential delivery, large package capabilities and SmartPost integration position us for future growth.', 'Leveraging the most automated network in the industry, we will once again offer seven day residential service to our customers throughout the peak season. After peak, the seven day residential delivery will become a permanent piece of our service offering. This will speed up our lanes throughout the week, and further extend our competitive advantage in some cases by two days.', \"We're also well underway in building our Ground’s large package handling capabilities to accommodate items like TVs, tires and furniture. This includes dedicated large package facilities, plus new handling equipment in more than 30 of our existing stations prior to peak. \", 'In terms of SmartPost, the integration of that volume into our network directly addresses one of the biggest challenges in the industry density. From a cost perspective moving these packages to the same service providers already delivering Ground commercial and residential packages goes a long way in driving density up and driving the cost per delivery down.', 'Integrating this volume provide significant growth opportunities with thousands of entrepreneurs who run pickup and delivery businesses with FedEx Ground.', 'We’ve already started transitioning SmartPost volume, majority of which will move during next calendar year. This should be complete before peak season in 2020. Investment in FedEx Ground was made and will continue to make in technology aim to optimize operations, reduce costs and enable real time decision making based on applied data analytics. We’re offering our service providers new technology tools, so they can make decisions about how best to run their business each day in terms of staffing needs, vehicle load plans and optimize routes. Arming our employees and service providers with the state-of-the art tools expected to drive efficiency in FedEx Ground’s operation, as well as the operations of service providers all the while strengthening the reliability of FedEx Ground service.', 'Several of these tools have started to be implemented in select markets prior to peak, immediate benefits will begin to be realized in fiscal year 2020, with increased benefits in the years to come. These investments will allow us to provide the speed and reliability our customers value, while offering market competitive prices as the low cost last mile provider. This means we are facing near-term headwinds including additional costs related to our service expansions and SmartPost volume integration. But these investments are necessary and will pay off in coming years.', 'And speaking of Last Mile, we’re strategically working with a number of retailers to leverage their physical infrastructure with our transportation and logistic infrastructure to provide market leading value proposition for the end consumer. Interest from retailers remains very high in this regard.', 'In closing, as we approach another busy peak season shipping season, we are well prepared to once again deliver exceptional service to our customers. We expect record breaking volumes in multiple Mondays during the peak season. E-commerce growth continues, which in turns drives strong demand for residential delivery. Peak season is four day shorter this year and operational intensity remains the same.', 'We have been preparing in close collaboration with our customers all year. The FedEx team of more than 450,000 outstanding team members is the best in the business and is ready to deliver the holidays once again for our customers around the world.', 'In summary, the power of our network, coupled with the hard work and dedication of our global team sets us on a path of long-term profitable growth.', \"Now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf to provide details on our financials. Alan.\", 'Alan Graf', 'Thank you, Raj and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter operating results were impacted by several factors. Weakening global trade and industrial production have resulted in less than expected demand for our most profitable Express package and Freight services. ', 'Express yields have also been negatively impacted due to the resulting mix shift, lower weight per package, and customer trade down to slower lower price services. These conditions are especially challenging in Europe, where capacity and network reductions are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks.', 'FedEx Ground operating costs were higher due primarily to our expansion of operations to six days per week, higher purchase transportation costs attributable to volume growth and expansion to six day operations and higher self-insurance expenses. Each transportation segment had one fewer operating day in the first quarter versus the prior year, which is estimated to have lowered earnings by approximately $100 million.', 'The loss of volume from Amazon had a negative impact to the quarter. Operating costs including depreciation also increased with strategic investment programs, including the modernization of FedEx Express aircraft and hubs and investment in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks, as well as enhanced safety and capabilities.', 'The modernization of our aircraft fleet lowers costs through enhanced reliability, reduced maintenance costs, and improve fuel efficiency. Partially offsetting these negative factors were the benefits from an approximate $300 million decrease in variable incentive compensation, FedEx Ground volume growth of 7%, increased revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground and cost reductions from business realignment activities, including the U.S. voluntary employee buyout initiated last year.', 'Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $11 to $13 per share. The new forecast reflects our lowered revenue outlook, driven by increasing trade tensions, and the corresponding weakening in global economic conditions, especially industrial production that has occurred since our June earnings release. With the increasing uncertainty of trade negotiations and government policies, forecasting customer demand and our corresponding earnings is exceedingly difficult.', 'Our forecasts assume moderate U.S. economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. A further ramping and anti-trade measures and/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business. While our current expectation is to earn slightly above the midpoint of our $11 to $13 range, we believe the range is appropriate given the current macro and business conditions we are experiencing. ', 'In addition to the impact of macro uncertainty, FedEx Ground operating expenses are expected to be higher than our previous forecast due to volume mix, lower than planned delivery density, higher wage rates and ongoing investments to enhance our e-commerce capabilities, including our expansion to seven day operations. The new forecast also reflects the loss of FedEx Ground business from Amazon that began in August.', 'Our FY 2020 effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment is now expected to increase 24% to 26% due to lower than expected earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. In response to these issues, we are taking additional actions on a number of fronts to better align our costs, including post peak reductions to the global FedEx Express air network.', \"We continue to expect to incur $350 million of TNT integration expenses in FY 2020 and $1.7 billion in total through FY 2021. We also continue to expect FY 2020 capital spending to be approximately $5.9 billion. While it's early in the process, we anticipate FY 2021 capital spending will be similar to FY 2020.\", 'During the first quarter, we issued $2.1 billion of debt. We use the proceeds to redeem debt maturing in this fiscal year, as well as to contribute $1 billion into our pension plans. We do not expect to make additional contributions to our U.S. pension plans this fiscal year. We also have no material debt maturities prior to fiscal 2022.', 'In conclusion, we are taking actions to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we are continuing to make strategic investments to improve our capabilities and efficiency, which we expect will drive long-term growth of earnings, margins, cash flow and returns. ', 'Now the operator can begin the question-and-answer session.', 'Question-and-Answer Session ', 'Operator', \"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\", 'Chris Wetherbee', 'Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to just talk about the reduction in guidance and get a little bit specific if we could. If you think about the difference of where you were three months ago versus where you are today, it kind of equates to almost a $900 million write down in the operating profit of the business this fiscal year. So if you give us a little bit more specific sort of buckets breakdown, what may be the lower revenues based on macro? And then maybe what may be caused by higher costs associated with certain restructuring the network to adapt to e-commerce that would be very helpful.', 'Alan Graf', 'Chris, I would say that the vast majority this 900 is the reduction of our revenue forecasts associated with the macroeconomic conditions that we did not expect. Some of the cost increases that you are seeing did have some impact, but the main reason was the macro. The biggest impact, of course, was at Express, and that was in international with a large degree of that in Europe.', 'Operator', \"We'll hear next from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\", 'Scott Group ', 'Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. So this is I think, the fifth straight quarter of either missing or cutting -- missing numbers or cutting guidance. Are you approaching guidance any differently meaning taking a more conservative approach here. Anything that you think that gives you some confidence or us some confidence that this is the final cut? ', \"And then I separately just want to understand, Raj, you said we're doing everything we can to reduce capital spending, and yet, CapEx is staying unchanged and now flat next year as well. So can you help us understand that? I know that's two questions, but hope we need some hand holding here I think.\", 'Alan Graf', \"Scott, I'll take on both. The lack of being able to hit our forecast is just the difficulty associated with forecasting in this environment. I don't think, we've been too aggressive based on what we knew at the time. You have noticed that, we've widen the range this year and I did mention that our current point estimate is higher than the midpoint of that range, so we've given ourselves a little bit more downside. I also said that we don't -- we're not expecting any additional weaknesses in the international macro environment from where we are today, which is a wild card. So I just want to point those things now to.\", \"As far as CapEx, trust me, FY 2021 would be a lot higher than $5.9 billion have we not started cutting already. I think there are two things that are really important to understand. And number one is, we have to continue to modernize the fleet. The profound impact of the lower costs and higher reliability of the new twins is just remarkable. And we're going to continue to do that, we're going to maybe stretch it out a bit, but not much because the faster we can get those in there, the faster we can enjoy those benefits.\", \"Fred mentioned the number of aircraft that we're going to take out a service either fully retiring or parking, so we're not adding capacity in our international network. And in fact, we're reducing that and we're reducing our domestic flight hours. But we need to modernize the fleet. It's very important. \", \"Secondarily, on the hubs at Express, where they’re underway, we have a lot of things that are committed. But the improved automation and processing capabilities of those two hubs when we finish are also profound in terms of the productivity and the amount of throughput we can handle. And we anticipate that we're going to need that. If we get further deterioration in the macro environment or we see something in the U.S., that looks like a recession, we’ll definitely cut further, but those are our plans at the moment.\", 'Operator', 'We’ll hear next from Jack Atkins with Stephens.', 'Jack Atkins', \"Hey guys, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you quantify the P&L benefits from the capacity and cost actions you announced this afternoon. And I guess from a bigger picture perspective, why are these capacity adjustments only being made now when it feels like we've been facing more challenging trade and industrial production trends since last December, what's prevented you from taking these actions before today? Thank you.\", 'Fred Smith', \"Let me take a shot at that. This is Fred Smith speaking. First of all, I think it's important to look at the things that we've said over the last few earnings call in the context of about what's going on globally. I mean, I watch the business press every day and I have to tell you, I think there's a lot of whistling past the graveyard about the U.S. consumer and the United States economy versus what's going on globally.\", \"So, the serious trade dispute began in the spring of 2018 and they escalated throughout the summer of 2018. And most people don't think about the fact that when China slows down because of U.S. tariffs or uncertainty or for whatever reason, as big of a victim, if you want to call it that, of the China slowdown is Europe, because Germany's contraction is because they're not selling as much to China, which is a huge customer of Europe.\", \"So remember, last spring, there was a tremendous amount of euphoria when we were going to get a deal, China trade deal. And then at the last minute, it broke up and then over the period of the summer there have been escalating tariffs on both sides and increasingly lowered industrial production and that's why we’ve put those charts up on the IR website.\", \"So we're reacting inside of FedEx to the same thing. So as we went into the fiscal year, we were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of restoration of normalcy that has not taken place. And the U.S. consumer, which is a remarkable driver of growth in employment, and all the things that are spoken about every day, sort of mass the fact that the goods producing sector, which we're in the midst of is much more global in nature than the U.S. consumer, which is largely services and certain consumption.\", \"So that's the reason that we began the year the way we began it, and should we have moved faster or known faster or what have you, I mean all I can do is report the numbers as we see them. And I would point out to you that last fall, we were the first people that call this out. And I remember very vividly. I mean, we are the leading prognosticator of this, we have 15 million votes every day in our system. And I remember when we made this call on CNBC, they took our heads off that we were, “blaming someone.” We're just reporting what's going on and reacting to these macroeconomic things. And as Alan said, that's why it makes us so hard to forecast. We think we've taken appropriate steps. We'll do more if we have to, but I can't give any better answer than what I just did.\", 'Operator', \"And from Barclays, we'll move on to Brandon Oglenski.\", 'Brandon Oglenski', \"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Fred, I guess coming off of that, I mean, clearly you guys have a culture of forward innovation and growth at FedEx. But I guess On the flip side, is there any like real ingrained process of the company that says, hey, we need to challenge every day what isn't working, because maybe even outside of these cyclical pressures. \", \"I mean, if you look at your LTL business, we can benchmark to other carriers that do better. Obviously, Express margins are at quite a low point right now. And you look at logistics or like FedEx Office, which we don't think have contributed a lot in the past. So, I guess, what can you tell investors that is the process for looking at things that maybe didn't pan out quite as well as you thought?\", 'Fred Smith', \"Well, I think you're a great person to ask that Brandon because you’re so called the deep dive, so let's talk about LTL. I don't think we have John Smith here to here today. First of all, there are other carriers that do better than FedEx with the exclusion of perhaps a little smaller carriers and ones sort of I'm not familiar with, I believe the better way to put that is there's one LTL carrier that does better than we do. And that's Old Dominion, and we're great admirers of Old Dominion. \", \"But Old Dominion operates a network that has I believe somewhere in the 200 and some odd stations, versus our 360. They don't deliver every day to every part of the United States. And they've been very brilliant in finding a niche that's for lack of a better term near TL. It's in that zone between LTL and TL and their average weight per shipment in much more dense network is about 350-400 pounds higher.\", 'So their margins are outstanding, and they have terrific and obviously, we benchmark them carefully as our other competitors, which gets to you your point, do we ever think about doing things differently? And the answer to that question is we think about doing things differently constantly. ', 'Secondly, in the Express business, there is a belief, including you, Brandon, that somehow our Express operation in the United States is not profitable. Our Express operation in United States is very profitable. And we have some of the best industrial engineers and operations research people in the country. ', \"So there has been this constant mantra for 10 years that we ought to put Express and Ground together. Well, my goodness, we’ve gained market share in Ground for 19 out of 20 years. And Brie and Raj just told you we think it's going to continue and our competitive advantage is going to improve. So we're very convinced that the way that we are operating is the preferred way. And yes, we look at it at it every day.\", \"The third thing that gets people fired up. And I guess, Scott Group just mentioned it about CapEx is we are profligate in terms of CapEx. The reality is about $0.60 out of every dollar we're spending on CapEx are to modernize the Express hubs, to put in this new technology, we can't get people in Indianapolis and Memphis to work it. They're not out there plus it improves the productivity. So the failure to do it would be very dire.\", \"And as Alan has said, and we've said over and over again, every time we bring on a 767 and to a much lesser degree, the 777 because we're not buying many other of them. It's accretive to earnings, the reliability goes up. So could we stop buying 767, and 777s? Yes, why don't we stop buying them, because we put a chart on the earnings -- the IR website today that showed the synergy between the three major OpCos. So 80% of our customers buy all three of the services.\", \"So, if you took FedEx and tried to subject it, let's say to I think it was BCG that came up to that diagram, you have dogs and cash flows and one thing or another. If you did not improve the Express company, unless your costs get out of control, you couldn't win in the Ground sector and vice versa.\", 'So, we are very convinced and we put up a chart that specifically addressed your comments about this, FedEx will unquestionably be the low cost producer in the domestic Express business because of the fleet modernization and that includes any new entrance into the business. ', \"Yes, we have higher pilot costs and AMT costs perhaps, than the third-party providers. We think that's a good thing. But our total productivity and our cost per tonne mile are down 2% over the past 10 years, in this year's dollars. I'm not talking about inflated dollars, I'm talking about 2019 dollars are 2% less than 2009 dollars.\", 'So the fleet modernization, yes, we could stop it and yes, we could stop that CapEx, but the competitive positioning against our major competitors.', \"And the last thing I'm going to say is, we basically compete in an ecosphere that's got five entities in it. There's UPS, there's DHL, there's a US Postal Service, and now increasingly, there is Amazon. That's who we wake up every day, trying to think about how we compete against and give the best services to our sales force.\", \"So, it reminds me of my days in the service where you run all these fake manoeuvres one thing another, it's a lot different when you got competition on the other side. So we try to beat these folks, UPS, and in particular has a very strong retail presence and both UPS and DHL have significant forwarding presences. So we’ve decided that we would basically cover those portfolio gaps with more focused capabilities, and that's why we operate differently.\", \"We carry retail freight on our purple tails and interline it, we don't have a huge forwarding operation. And we have a retail network that is smaller than UPS store franchise network, but utilizes partners as Brie talked to you about Walgreens, and dollar -- more recently Dollar General and some others. \", \"So the reason I'm going on about this, I'm not quite sure how this mantra got started, that we're hard hitted, or we're not willing to look, we'll look at anything. But what we can’t do is to change the reality of the math. We can't make the competition go away, I wish they would, just leave the field, they're very good operators.\", \"And the third thing that we have to deal with is the macroeconomic environment. And by the way, there's no company and no person that has been more vocal in our opposition to the trade policies that we are pursuing. Now, to be fair, I think it's not just the U.S., I think China is also pursuing bad trade policy. So you're taking a system over the last seven years that’s drawn more people out of poverty than in the entire previous history of the world, and essentially putting it all at risk.\", \"So these numbers on these macroeconomic production indicators, we didn't make those up. That's what's going on. So I apologize for the length of the response. But it's to this continuing drumbeat that somehow we're not willing to look at something and you take selective things like your LTL operation in as good as, all the others, it's not as good as one and it's not as good as the other ones in terms of margins for the reasons that I gave you. So it's important to look at this thing with those contexts in mind.\", 'Next question.', 'Operator', 'We’ll hear now from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.', 'Allison Landry', \"Thanks, good afternoon. So you talked a lot about the short-term cost inflation at Ground and driving down the cost of delivery longer term. I think you've done a pretty good job of explaining that to the market. But it sounds like you're also seeing some unexpected costs creep, higher wage rates, lower delivery density so forth. So, I guess, could you help us understand some kind of timeline for when we should expect to see some of the operating leverage and inflection of margins at the Ground segment, is fiscal 2021 the right way to think about it or do we need to look further out than that? Thank you.\", 'Alan Graf', \"I like your Ground margins, I think they're fine. And I think we told you early on in the intro, Allison, as at least it goes to zone one where we think we're going to grow really rapidly. We're talking about lower yields and higher margins. So I think Ground performing admittedly. The issue at Ground is there's just not the commercial traffic we'd plan to have, which has significantly higher density than home delivery does. Home delivery is growing like crazy and the commercial businesses not because of industrial production, and all the other things we said.\", \"So that's a fairly simple explanation. We're adjusting the model accordingly to do that. I think Ground’s in great shape. I think it's doing fantastic. And I don't see anybody making better margins than us.\", 'Fred Smith', \"Let me let me make one comment here, and then Raj and or Henry Maier, the CEO of FedEx Ground is sitting here so he can speak to this too, Allison. First thing that people need to understand the things we announced this spring and this summer, we just didn't dream them up in the last few months. \", \"We've been working on these for almost four years. And during that period of time, we have invested enormous amount of money in IT, which has been dragged through the P&L to make sure that I can make a statement and let me make it again because I think it may have gone over some people's heads.\", 'We will in the short zone market, the zone one market, the ship from store or ship from local DC, FedEx will be the low cost, high service producer, you can put the traffic in very, very late in night or in the morning and at lower cost than anybody and I mean anybody, all of the five competitors that I mentioned a moment ago.', \"So all of these moves that we announced were triggered by a series of developments. And the strategy has been in production for a long time. So we're very confident about where this market is going that Brie described to you and we're very confident in Ground’s position. But as Alan just mentioned, the B2B Ground business is being adversely affected for the same reason that the international PMI is going down.\", \"The trade effects and the goods production side of the house is much greater than it is in the services business. And that's being reflected across all our businesses; Freight, Ground Commercial, and particularly International. Henry, Raj?\", 'Raj Subramaniam ', \"Well, let me just add on to that by just saying that there's a strong divergence between the strong consumer sector and the weak factory sector around the world and U.S. as being no exception. That the industrial production in U.S. is expected to be flat to negative in the second half of CY 2019 that's the issue and once we get the commercial traffic -- that's the issue. Ground is doing very, very well. And we are definitely investing for the future and we are going to have the market leading value proposition, best service at low cost. So let me turn it over to Henry for his comment.\", 'Henry Maier', \"Allison, let me just add cost headwinds at Ground are largely six and seven-day, because there's a minimum number of people and to staff a billing in order to operate it prior to the volume and revenue coming on. The wage rate issue is a number of things. First is year-over-year driver rates, which are reflective of the intense competition for truck drivers in certain geographic markets, both in PMD and line haul.\", 'However, what we see going forward, as we transition out of the current model into the independent service provider model, which will be completely stood up on October 12th is annual, if not multi-year negotiations with those businesses about the rate -- about their settlement rates. ', \"Finally, we've talked about the robust labor environment out there. There are geographic markets, where it's highly competitive to get package handlers into the building. And while our automated network benefits us greatly in that regard for employees, where we're competing for the same unskilled labor in the market we have to be cost competitive. And that's just a function of the strength of the economy and the markets we operate in.\", 'Operator', 'And from Goldman Sachs we move to Jordan Alliger. ', 'Jordan Alliger', 'Yes. Hi, guys. Just sort of from a big picture standpoint, can you remind a little bit what your long-term earnings or profit growth targets would be sort of once we get past this noise? And perhaps assess the ability of things to bounce back. Assuming the economy is okay, and assuming you implement the cost initiatives and the capacity initiatives that you do. Do you anticipate as we look into fiscal 2021 and 2022, that sort of growth can exceed sort of that long-term EPS growth target? Thanks.', 'Fred Smith', \"It depends on your outlook for the economy for sure. I mean, we said we're going to be really well positioned by the end of 2021. Yes, we were late and over budget on the TNT integration, but we're there we're will be there. And I don't know what the economic environment in Europe will be at that point, but we will be able to significantly reduce our costs and improve our service for all the reasons we've told you about. That's one.\", \"Two, some of the things that we've talked about at Ground, like the loss of Amazon, getting ready for six and seven day, a lot of that stuff will be behind us. And we'll be ready to move forward. So given a decent economic environment, we ought to be able to easily hit our 10% to 15% earnings EPS growth going forward. But I can't tell you that that's going to be the case because I can't tell you what exactly the economy is going to look like right now. So if I'm a little gun shy, yes, probably I’m.\", 'Operator', 'Moving on to David Ross with Stifel.', 'David Ross', 'Yes. Good afternoon. Maybe a question for Mark, with Assembly Bill 5 out in California, I know since the extradition and refining [ph] the independent contractor model and now are moving towards an all ISP model. Is there anything in that proposed bill that could challenge the current ISP model or how are you guys viewing that right now?', 'Henry Myer', \"Hey, David, it’s Henry Myer. I've been designated the company paralegal for this call. Let me get it up -- let me give the people listening in a little bit of background on Assembly Bill 5. Back on April 30, 2018, The California Supreme Court issued a ruling in the dynamics case, which held an ABC test should be used to determine whether a worker who is an employee or an independent contractor. Assembly Bill 5 is just an attempt by the legislature to codify the dynamics decision of the Supreme Court.\", \"For those who aren't aware, there are a number of states that have ABC test, the A prong says an individual must be free of control and direction. The B prong a service has to be performed outside the usual course of business of the employer. And the C prong is the individual is customarily engage in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. \", \"This is intended to address individuals who are classified as independent contractors. We believe it's largely directed at the ride sharing and food delivery business in California. And because FedEx Ground only contracts with businesses that are incorporated in a good standing in the states in which they operate. We therefore have no individuals who are classified as independent contractors.\", 'All service provider employees under contract to FedEx Ground are subject to tax withholdings and are eligible for workers comp unemployment insurance and over time. And all of our service providers are contractually obligated to treat their workers as employees are registered as I said, in a good standing with the states and agreed to compliance audits by the company.', 'So therefore, we think that any risks that would accrue to FedEx Ground would be minimal to non-existent the way the bill is currently structured.', 'Operator', 'Helane Becker with Cowen & Company has our next question. ', 'Helane Backer', \"Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. Brie, I think you talked about demand from China being down between China and the U.S. and China and Europe. But did you speak at all to goods going from China to third countries? And then how those volumes are doing, for example, China to Vietnam and then Vietnam to the U.S. or Taiwan or places elsewhere in Asia. So maybe you could talk about trends you're seeing and goods moving that way, if at all?\", 'Brie Carere', \"So great question, obviously, right now, from an outlook perspective, we are seeing pressure on all intercontinental and even within Asia, all of intra-Asia really is connected from a supply chain perspective. So even if it isn't direct to China, we are seeing a lot of pressure intra-Asia. What I think is most important to note, is we both Raj and I mentioned, is we are under penetrated from a market share perspective between Asia and Europe and Europe to Asia. \", \"We now have unleashed an incredible buyer base in Europe which we never had access to before and we have traditionally been very underpenetrated in this lane, and Jill and I are locked arm and arm to grow share despite the macroeconomic headwinds. So I think that's really what's most important. And that's what's newsworthy for us as we think about growth moving forward.\", 'Operator', 'And from Oppenheimer, we’ll move to Scott Schneeberger.', 'Scott Schneeberger', 'Thanks, good afternoon. [Technical difficulty] in international priority and international economy in the environment and perhaps provide a perspective on the influence of fuel prices and the trade down dynamic, if and how that may factor into this updated guidance? Thanks.', 'Raj Subramaniam ', \"Scott, fuel prices have very little to do with this at this point. And I think there’s a macroeconomic environment and primarily the industrial sector of the global economy that's driving that change.\", 'Operator', 'We’ll go next to Bernstein Research, David Vernon.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking our question asking on behalf of David Vernon, how should we think about the greater than 20% increase in corporate center loss? And is there any outlook there?', 'Fred Smith', \"Well, we have moved FedEx Office out to its own now, as you noticed, and while FedEx Office itself for reporting purposes, reports a loss gives you that as a channel cost, if you like. It's a vital channel and we've talked about this over and over and over again, our most profitable packages come through FedEx Office, FedEx Office has got many, many places where you can pick up, drop off great relationship going with in-store at Walmart.\", \"So, I wouldn't be too concerned about that we have work to do on our logistics side of the house, we are working very hard on that. And I expect those will improve over time. But really at the end of the day, the real -- again, the real issue, I want to make sure I get this clear to everybody. All the things we've talked about. Our issue is international at Express.\", 'Operator', 'Now from Deutsche Bank will move to Amit Mehrotra.', 'Amit Mehrotra', 'Thanks, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask if you think 2020 will represent a trough in Ground margins that you can build on in 2021 given the, I guess, the SmartPost integration? And then can you just update us on the integration of TNT businesses in the UK, France and Germany? Where are those countries, given their size and when do you expect the integration to be complete for those regions? Thank you.', 'Fred Smith', \"I think that was two. I think, we've answered them both, but I'll try to stab at this again. We will be complete with those countries at the end of May 2020. Again, as you have well pointed out in your note, we were a little bit late, a little bit over budget on that. Thank you for that.\", 'And as far as FedEx Ground margins, again, we will have a lot of these things behind us, it will depend on our mix and economic environment about how fast we can move margins up, but we do expect our zone one traffic to grow rapidly and although at lower yield it will be at higher margins.', 'Operator', \"And with that at this time, I'd like to turn things back to you, to offer any additional or closing remarks.\", 'Mickey Foster', 'Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation first quarter earnings conference call.

As with our creative products, our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop and mobile devices. In Q3 more than 2.5 billion PDFs were opened in Adobe Reader on mobile devices. Adobe Scan, which has become the top document scanning app for both iOS and Android, has close to 35 million installs, with downloads increasing more than 30% year-over-year in Q3.', 'Strong uptake of our Document Cloud mobile applications, as well as continued strength in Acrobat subscription adoption, is driving momentum in the business. In addition, we launched new web-based services that offer instant access to Adobe PDF creation and compression capabilities from any browser. We believe these services are not only relevant to individuals looking to quickly get work done, but also developers who need to build best-in-class PDF document support into their web applications. We are investing in creative marketing campaigns to drive awareness of these capabilities and target new users.

Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q3, and we increased Creative ARR by $314 million. Strong acquisition, up sell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions continued during Q3, and were driven by New user growth, helped by many global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, a large funnel of users coming from desktop and mobile; and leveraging Adobe’s brand and new products to expand into adjacent creative categories.

In addition, there were Analytics Cloud subscription bookings delays with related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with the launch of our new Adobe Experience Platform. We are confident the enhanced innovation in Analytics Cloud, the introduction of our Real-Time CDP product, and the ongoing global roll-out of the Adobe Experience Platform will convert strong customer demand and the current pipeline into bookings starting in Q4.', 'We now expect to grow our total Digital Experience subscription bookings in fiscal 2019 by greater than 20% year-over-year.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of a day from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.', 'KeithWeiss', \"Thank you guys for taking the question. And very nice quarter particularly on digital media side of the equation. It does sound like you guys are having some sort of go-to-market and disruption impacts on the digital experience side of equation. I was hoping if you could dig in a little bit further to help us explain exactly what's going on that side of the business. What does it take to fix that? Because it's definitely something like you were much more optimistic about that business a quarter ago. And then maybe one for John is there any margin impact in terms of increasing investment and inside sales and some other go-to -market stuff that is going to take to get experience clouds back up to the growth rates you guys are expecting.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Great. Keith as you pointed out, it was a strong quarter, we were pleased with the growth across the businesses. Since I suspect that there'll be a couple of people asking about digital experience, let me go into a little bit more color on that particular opportunity. And let me clarify that wasn't any impact associated with macro. The interest from enterprises all sizes, different verticals in our comprehensive solutions remains incredibly strong. And even if you look at the targets that we've provided, it's clear that we are delivering strong revenue growth while actually accelerating the subscription bookings year-over-year on what is a much larger book of business because we do an apples-to-apples comparison.\", \"I think as you think about Q3, it's clear we have leading solutions in the first mile and the last mile. So Adobe Experience Manager campaign and Magento had strong growth. The Magento acquisition’s been viewed exceedingly well by customers. It's clearly very strategic and we grew the book of business greater than 40% in Q3. And actually have done a really good job of taking Magento into the enterprise. The other part that we're absolutely clear about is that there's a new generation of enterprise software that's going to emerge which will be required to digitally engage with customers across all these multiple channels. What it has to do is deliver first mile content experiences, that’s the content and commerce piece.\", \"It has to segment audiences now in real time across multiple channels. You have to do customer journey management and orchestration and you have to provide data and insights to enable these AI services. We've been focused on this opportunity just like we created the digital marketing category. We believe this is absolutely crucial for the experience business and so we built the Adobe experience platform from scratch to deliver what we call DDOM in terms of how we run our own digital business. Customers are really excited. It's the first software actually that exists that's designed to specifically integrate the needs of the CMO, the Chief Revenue Officer and the CIO.\", \"So our strategy with the Adobe Experience platform is that we want to actually augment the analytics capability, the audience manager capability with what we are doing with these new services as well as the real-time CDP in the market. We're really excited about the multiple installations that we have as well as the interest globally. You can argue we were maybe a tad aggressive, Keith, about the timing adoption, but this phase shift that we've seen in no way diminishes the magnitude of the opportunity or my belief in the lead that we have. And so as I think about the business, as we think about the targets, we're leading in this particular category. We saw as I said some delays in the bookings, but that has in no way changed our excitement and optimism about the business. So hopefully that helps give you some color associated with each of the businesses.\", \"The last thing I would say is that we talked about Marketo specifically. And there I would say our natural inclination was to perhaps focus our aspirations on the enterprise business, serve our existing customers that's going well. Mid market continues to be a huge growth opportunity. We have the leading product in that space and much like we drove growth in the Magento business; our focus will now be the same on Magento as well as Marketo. And so we've created a unified organization; it's going to drive - align demand generation, customer support. We have the right individuals in the field. It's organized the right way. So I'm excited about that as well. I know I was a little long, but I thought I'd just give you color associated with all of those businesses. And again the Adobe Experience platform that is really our platform that deals with future of what we are doing around analytic services, what we are doing around campaign services. And so when bookings are light you certainly see some impact on consulting as well.\", 'JohnMurphy', \"Yes. Keith, to answer your question on investments here. They've been factored into the targets that we issued for Q4. And as you've seen those targets we continue to expand, our operating margin as we had expected through the year as we said the second half would accelerate expansion. So the investments are embedded in those targets and as Shantanu said, we're focused on really driving that big market motion like we did with Magento.\", 'Operator', 'Next we hear from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. ', 'KirkMaterne', \"Thanks very much. Maybe I’ll flip over to the digital media side the business which actually had a really strong quarter. Shantanu maybe the stat that stood out to me was actually some of the subs growth in the emerging markets. And can you just provide a little bit more detail on that sort of how you feel like you're monetizing those opportunities, how that is coming along? And maybe just talk a little bit about the opportunity maybe internationally because I know that sort of just sort of taking off right now. Thanks.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Sure, Kirk. And yes when we look at digital media ARR both across the creative as well as the document business, we just continue to see strength. If you look at our targets for the combined year, I mean it's clear that driving approximately $1.6 billion of net new digital media ARR. Creativity and design have never been important. A couple of points; the first is mobile. What we've been doing with the mobile applications and having mobile be an on-ramp especially in international as well as key emerging markets. What we've seen with the Lightroom system that we've developed photography is such a universal phenomenon and Lightroom's a great product.\", \"So we're driving adoption across a couple of dimensions. The first is the number of people who come in from mobile and only buy a mobile subscription through an app store. The people who come in through mobile but then realize that there's more to Adobe's creative offerings and then come in and download a desktop application as well as then adopted. We're seeing significant growth for document cloud also in these international markets as they are migrating from the perpetual version of the product as well as engaging on the web. This is something that we started to talk about which is people just coming from a web; they want to create a PDF; they want to export PDF. That's seeing traction. So and frankly Stock we actually did some really interesting work with Stock. Stock was a primarily a US product but as you have more international content, as you have the search capabilities available, so the services revenue is also increasing. So just across the board as we talk about new customer acquisition, as we talk about focus on engagement, mobile certainly has momentum and services like Adobe Stock both in the US as well as international. And the last thing I'll say is that the DDOM that we have really gives us insight into what's effective in those markets. So rather than have a one-size-fits-all where we spend our money digitally, how we engage with our customers; how do we price the products appropriately. China is again seeing really good growth as it relates to our team offering and creative cloud. And so across the board, it just reflects creativity as important and we're the leader.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.', 'BrentThill', \"Great. Shantanu just back on the digital experience business, if you plug in your fourth quarter guide, you're going to come in a few points below your full year guide. And I'm just curious I think the Marketo mid-market and some of the other explanations makes sense, but this has been something historically that's been fairly inconsistent. I guess a question is how do you get back to more consistency in making numbers in this business? And if you could just comment as it relates to your [linear] [ph], why it taking so long to get someone in that seat for the new role. Thank you.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Well, couple of questions in there, Brent. And the first one is I would say as I pointed out at the beginning, we're growing our subscription book of business which is a much larger subscription book of business greater in 2019 that we did in 2018. So I think putting that in perspective, I would say clearly with the mid market our motion was perhaps a lot more in the enterprise. We saw tremendous success with Magento in the enterprise and creating a demand generation machine. I think having that aligned organization part of what I've done is I've been running this business is to align all of them quicker. I wish I'd done it even earlier in terms of having a combined Magento and Marketo mid market offering because that demand generation is a machine. So I'm confident that we'll see improvements as a result of those organizational changes.\", \"And the Adobe Experience platform when you look at it, Brent, nobody's delivered something like this. It is so innovative. We talked about it being groundbreaking and much like we did with digital marketing which is when we first came out we were decades ahead of the competition. We feel excited about that; customer interest is high; there's an ongoing on-ramp and maybe we were a tad aggressive but when you have the leader and you're driving such innovation, we have to be optimistic about what we are doing for customers. And we experience firsthand what it takes.\", \"So we're confident that we will continue to grow that business the way we have. And as it relates to the organization, I think I mentioned this last time as well. I intentionally put that on hold because I needed to get all of those organizations aligned. The product roadmap, the innovation roadmap that exists right now, Brent, is stronger than it's ever been as a result I think of various help over the last six months. What we are doing with delivering new services; the AI and intelligence services that are available; the delivery of the Adobe Experience platform; what we've done with content and commerce. Aligning that and getting that unified that is clearly the sweet spot of where other is helping and where I focused.\", \"And I think that would not have happened without somebody doing that directly. And so I'm actually pleased that I did it. And aligned the organization first. So it's in great shape for somebody when they come in.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS.', 'JenniferLowe', \"Great. Thank you. And maybe just to follow up on Brent's question little bit because there were a number of different items that came up there both in terms of getting greater product alignment in terms of Marketo and Magento and also organizational alignment. So is it possible to just sort of at a high level give us a sense of how much of this is product related issue of just trying to get the products working together versus just organizational? And as you think about how long this will take to kind of get back to where you'd like to be? Is that something that could happen in a quarter or two? Or could this be a more extended timeline to get all the things working the way you want them to?\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"So, Jennifer, again multiple questions there. First, let me let me end with that which is in Q4 we expect substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings in that particular business. So let me start off by that. I think when you introduce an upgrade to the analytics which is now available through the Adobe Experience platform; the customer adoption has been good. It doesn't have to do with the product issue. The product is years ahead of the competition as I said. It's a new motion. I mean what we went through, as we went through our digital transformation; people have to get ready for that adoption. And we are seeing that right now; we're seeing the on-ramp. So I would put that less as any product issue definitely not a customer demand issue.\", \"And it's just one of those things that you work through and you work through aggressively to ensure that customers get the value that they want. And again in Q4, we expect a substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings based on the pipeline and based on what we would do.\", 'Operator', \"Next we'll hear from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. \", 'MarkMoerdler', \"Thank you and congrats on the quarter also. This quarter even with the integration work in sales expansion driven by Marketo and Magento acquisition, you delivered a really good operating margin. Given what you looking --sounds like you're going to do in terms of the increased mid market focus in other areas, any reason why we shouldn't continue to see that margin continue to move up. Thank you.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Well, Mark, if you look at our sort of guidance for Q4 and look at what the operating margin guidance would be on the revenue that we outlined and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, it's clear that we are continuing to focus on the margin as well. And I think at the beginning of the year we had said you would start to see margins back in the 40%, that's certainly there. However, big picture I would say we really focused on the long-term opportunity and continuing to drive top-line growth. But the margins and the leverage in the model you saw that in Q3 as well across the business. And you are right in that the mid market motions are more marketing and generated by demand through the website and less through direct sales. So that would be better margins than perhaps an enterprise business. \", 'Operator', 'Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities has our next question.', 'JayVleeschhouwer', \"Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, I'd like to ask a sequel to the technology question I asked a quarter ago although without the plethora of three-letter acronyms that we talked about at the time. And still however with intent to understand how you're thinking about your technology or platform as a driver to content velocity usage and ultimately retention. So the question tonight is about AEM? Next year is the 10th anniversary of the Day acquisition and as best we can tell you've quintupled or more the revenue from that product. So perhaps you just talk about how you're thinking about the ongoing momentum in AEM? Any fundamental investments or re-architecture you work you need to do or are doing in AEM to continue to drive that as the focal point of DX? And then just a quick clarification in terms of the fixes that you talk about at least for mid-market in DX, are you planning to accelerate or implement any more of the self-service capabilities that we've talked about there besides the inside sales and other things you talked about tonight.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"So let me answer the second question first, Jay, which is certainly both the Magento and Marketo we have both self-serve capabilities as well as a ecosystem of partners. As you know with Magento having the open source community help us not just with bringing us leads, but also helping integrate with any point of sale or inventory or supply chain systems. It's a huge advantage and I think we're leveraging that. And also as it relates to Magento, we've already integrated that with our AEM. On AEM, content just continues to be a significant, significant differentiator and I referred to it earlier as the first mile experience that every customer has with a digital enterprise. Some really exciting things underway there. As you know, when we acquired Day Software that was a perpetual business, I think we effectively transitioned it to be a managed services business.\", \"We have some really exciting plans underway that we're starting to deliver to customers as it relates to fully SaaS-ifying that and making that even more self-serve in terms of people using that technology. When you think about what's happening with what's called headless content management that's an area of significant investment for us, so that people can automate their content production. AEM assets which is the assets product, there's a lot of excitement for that for content velocity as you pointed out. We talked a little bit less about AEM forms, but AEM forms also is a way in which people want to use AEM technology, so AEM has really become a platform; it's your web infrastructure which really exciting for us is there isn't a digital event that happens. Whether it's debate, companies introducing product launches, sports events that aren't completely run sort of on Adobe technology.\", \"And that's really exciting to see when we see these spikes in our traffic; we know what's happening in virtually every online event. And AEM is at the core of that. AEM had a strong quarter; it continues to be a way in which people are re-platforming their web and so stay tuned for more. But hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of the things that we're doing. The move to SaaS; the move towards headless content and asset management are maybe three of the ones I'd identified.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.', 'HeatherBellini', \"Great. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to a couple questions that were asked previously. One just thinking through the digital experience and some of the comments you made, can you give us a sense is it- is there anything to do from a competitive standpoint here? Is it really all go-to-market? And I'm just wondering kind of who you're seeing most frequently and if that's changed? And then I think to Jen's question kind of talking about margins, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about OpEx growth? And based on your comments and your guide for the Q4 and as such the full year, when we think about parsing your comment about investing for growth and margin, how should we be thinking about the pace of OpEx growth going forward? I mean you guys have been 20% or higher for the last few years. Obviously, there's M&A included in that, but should we be expecting just given the opportunities that are ahead of you kind of similar type growth rates as we start to think about the period ahead. Thank you.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Sure. So let me answer the first question, while there may be some point solutions that have point competitors or products that are there in the market that do similar technology for the vast majority of what we offer in digital experience, we are the undisputed leaders. And really as we talk about the innovation for new things like Adobe Experience platform, the real-time CDP, what we are doing with intelligence services, Heather, were, there really isn't anybody else who's offering capabilities similar to what we have in the market.\", \"I think as it relates to M&A if that was a question, there is nothing major that we look at and feel like is a gap currently in our portfolio. I think the combination of Magento and Marketo and what we've done with the Adobe Experience platform that gives us without a doubt the leading platform and a significant portfolio to continue to drive growth. I think what we are doing on the document side with the verbs and having the ability for people to embed PDFs or think of it as a PDF service, we're pretty excited about the opportunity associated with that. And we talk about creative. So hopefully that gives you a flavor as we talk about the $100 billion addressable market that's really driving our growth at this point. \", 'HeatherBellini', 'And then question on OpEx right, OpEx growth. ', 'JohnMurphy', \"Yes. Well, again on all-expense really, I mean I think when we look at margins in general where our goal is to continue to invest in top-line growth, but then obviously drive efficiencies both and how we look at our COGS and how we're looking at the rest of the P&L. And so you see that here in Q3 we are able to vary through a lot of like relentless fiscal discipline contribute to the lower OpEx in Q3 than probably was modeled and it came through and obviously in the EPS performance. And you'll see that again in Q4 as we've modeled it out. You see the operating margin expand again in Q4 based upon our targets.\", \"So we're diligently focused on that from time to time like we did with the acquisitions. We found opportunities to invest in growth and we'll do that, but the idea is to really always focus on growing our earnings as fast if not faster than revenue.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.', 'SaketKalia', \"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. John maybe for you and I apologize for the background noise by the way. Adobe continues to do a good job on generating new creative ARR. And so as you think about next year understanding that we aren't giving guidance yet, can you just talk about so the puts and takes to how ARR may look next year, particularly with some of the benefit of pricing that we got in fiscal 2019?\", 'JohnMurphy', \"When I look at ARR in more philosophically because obviously we have Analyst Day coming up where we'll actually talk a lot about next year. We've laid out many, many times the different drivers that we have and Shantanu covered a number of them when he talked about that earlier to the earlier question. So we have international markets. We've got new products. We've got single apps and mobile on-ramp that are really driving new users to the platform. And that's our -- one of our biggest growth areas. And that's still a focus for us. Yes, we have, I think other folks have asked about promotions before as well. And we use those; we've seen through our DDOM model that they're very effective in driving new users and then converting those to paid users.\", \"So overall we've got a number of vectors that we believe we can continue to grow ARR in the future and beyond.\", 'Operator', 'Alek Zukin with RBC Capital Markets has our next question.', 'AleksandrZukin', \"Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just the first one about the -- if it's possible to unpack kind of the -- where the greater magnitude of the bookings kind of headwinds came from, whether it was more the mid-market Marketo side or whether it was the Analytics side. And then just maybe one for John about the cash flow, outperformance in the quarter was a bit below our numbers. Was there -- were there any onetime issues there that should self-correct?\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Yes. Alek, as it relates to the bookings I would in order a sort of priority first talk about the analytics as it's moving to the Adobe Experience Manager, so the combination of analytics and audience manager sort of moving to experience platform with the real-time CDP. And then to a lesser extent the Marketo mid-market. So that's sort of how I would look at it as people are transitioning and upgrading to the Adobe Experience platform.\", 'JohnMurphy', \"And on cash flow, we're actually pretty happy with the performance, but we did have someone times in the quarter. We ended up taking advantage of some favorable vendor pricing by doing a couple large prepayments. And then also we had some timing of some tax payments in the quarter as well. So those impacted that, but excluding those items would've been well above a $1 billion in the quarter.\", 'Operator', \"Next we'll hear from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.\", 'SterlingAuty', \"Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned the softness in the Marketo bookings, specifically mid-market. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of that business is usually targeted towards mid market? And is there a different kind of product set or requirement than what you're currently offering that you think you need to deliver to get it back on track?\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Sterling, I think first to put it in perspective we saw growth. We're talking about the acceleration and mid market the way we did it for Magento in terms of sort of growing it across the enterprise. And so I think it's really all about having the demand generation machine, which is easier to fix in terms of getting that sort of motion going again in the company. And in terms of it being self-serve, I mean the product is actually applicable already across the mid-market and enterprise. So there are no product issues there. It really has been as I said the natural inclination was to go in the enterprise. And so continuing to accelerate the mid-market in addition to enterprise like we're focusing on Magento. And having that as an aligned organization so we can leverage our marketing is the two changes we've made.\", 'SterlingAuty', 'And the general split enterprise versus mid-market in that business?', 'ShantanuNarayen', \"We have such good market share across both of those segments as the leading B2B segment; it really is well penetrated across both. If there's any --this probably more penetration in the mid market and the smaller size of the large enterprises than the large enterprise, Sterling, if I were to give you some color on their current penetration within the enterprise.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Kas Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', 'KasthuriRangan', \"Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I just want to clarify, generally when you put out a newly integrator platform, the enterprise market is one that's a little bit more demanding and so they are the ones that are likely to delay purchasing, but here it appears that it's more on the mid-market side. So I'm just curious to get a little bit more color. What else could do you need to see in the product by which the customer base can move forward with confidence? And I've got to believe that just based on the new guidance for Q4 that we're not expecting a snapback in marketing or what used to be called marketing cloud bookings. So therefore should we expect whatever you expected for this year to actually happen next year, while not being specific about a growth rate. Thank you so much. \", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"So, Kas, first with respect to the bookings, let me again reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, which is we would expect the overall subscription book of business for all of the experienced cloud across mid market, across enterprise and across all solutions to be greater than 20%. So I wanted to make sure that that was understood despite what we saw in Q3. I think as it relates to your first question, the integrated platform that is really aimed more at the enterprise and that's the natural migration of analytics and audience manager customers.\", 'I think the mid-market is specifically as it relates to Marketo, so I just wanted to clarify that. And so there are no issues with respect to adoption in the enterprise, if anything as I said we were maybe a tad aggressive with how quickly they would adopt it, but we do expect to see substantial bookings in Q4 quarter-over-quarter.', 'KasthuriRangan', \"Got it. And the outlook for this combined newly integrated platform going into next year. What are the things that you could do or customers can do that they could not do with the previous product? Just trying to understand qualitatively how this changes things for Adobe. That's it. Congrats.\", 'ShantanuNarayen', \"Well, I think what we've been through, Kash, with our own move to digital, the ability to have a real-time platform where you can actually activate what happens to customers across multiple channels, it doesn't exist. I mean the first generation of dealing with these customers is a record in a database that is completely inadequate in terms of how people can engage with customers. So this is absolutely groundbreaking in terms of what can be done. So think of it as you know how many times have you gone to a website; you've bought a product and then the ad for that product continues to dog you for weeks.\", \"And maybe sometimes to add insult to injury, it actually says there's a discount now available for that product. That's sort of the thing that we're addressing or when you call in to a customer support and you've done something in a retail store or you've done something online and it has no idea about who you are and what you did. So I think this real-time CDP; the other massive movement that you know is happening is between known and unknown and the movement towards that with browsers. So we're the first to convert what was our leading position with DMP or data management into real time CDP or a customer data platform.\", \"So this is the ability to have one single unified view of a customer across multiple channels, understand how you acquire them; understand how you engage with them. So that's really what I think is an imperative for every company doing digital transformation. So that's our opportunity and our lead.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.', 'WalterPritchard', \"Hi. Sorry for the background noise here. John, just question for you on pricing as a driver. I've noticed in the past you have outlined in this quarter, you outlined the different -- some of the different drivers in the script. And I didn't see pricing there. I'm wondering sort of how pricing both the expiration of the promotional pricing as well as some of the pricing actions you taking over the last 18-months are faring as drivers of the creative business compared to what you've seen in recent quarters. Thanks.\", 'JohnMurphy', \"Sure, Walter. Yes, pricing is certainly is a lever; it's not one that we've ever used really as a driver for an annual price increase to increase ARR for instance. One of the things that we look at is the value that we're providing to the customers. And when we provide the value and we see that value resonate with customers then we price it accordingly. What we saw this year, of course, was the price increase that we did I should say last year for North America and then this year internationally in Australia and Japan, we seen those price increases be well accepted. We've customers who stay on the platform and the value was resonating.\", \"So it's something that we'll look at. It's not a core driver, but something that is one of the many levers that we can use to grow.\", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from Chris Eberle with Nomura Instinet.', 'ChrisEberle', \"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to touch on advertising really quickly. We had noticed that back in August Google had shut out Adobe PSP from their ad exchange. Can you talk about if that had any effect at all or maybe just kind of remind us the size of that business down, if it's material at all? Thanks. \", 'ShantanuNarayen', 'So the easy answer to that it really had no impact. That was one day in one part of Europe as a result of customer who used it inappropriately and we were backup and running. So that really had no issue. I mean the advertising business for us is important part of the Experience Cloud business. It allows the CMOs to have real attribution associated with their marketing spend. It helps with customer acquisition as the on ramp to a digital business. So it plays a strategic role and we have good offering and that it cuts across all of the different channels that people are looking to acquire customers on namely TV, search, display and video. ', \"So I think in particular where we are strongest right now is certainly in helping people with the new media type such as video and TV. So that's it as it relates to the ad business. I mean given that was the last question; I continue to believe that Adobe is not just driving but we are creating large market opportunities. We were pleased with our fiscal performance in Q3. And I am particularly pleased with the product road map and innovation that we are delivering across all three clouds to what is increasingly and incredibly diverse set of customers. Our strategy empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is certainly working. And we are executing against that strategy. Design and creativity have never been important. You've seen the strength in both the creative as well as the document business.\", \"And digital transformation and digitization continues to be an incredible opportunity. Clearly, FY19 will be another record year with strong cash flow and margin expansion. And as a plug, particularly excited about the innovation that we are going to showcase at MAX. It's going to be our largest Creative Event. And I hope to see you join us in LA for both MAX as well as our FA meeting.

Active customers grew 3.4 million year-over-year to 12 million customers. Net sales per active customer increased approximately 10% to $352, up from $320 in Q2 2018.', 'Autoship customer sales as a percent of net sales reached 69.3%. Gross margin for Q2 was 23.6%, up 300 basis points year-over-year as a result of continuing execution on the growth and margin vectors that we have shared with you previously. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin of negative 2.5% improved 410 basis points versus Q2 2018, as a result of gross margin expansion and scaling of operating expenses.', 'The inputs of our business remain strong, and we continued to drive topline growth at scale and optimize the business for margin expansion through disciplined data-driven decisions. Time and again, we hear from pet parents that their experience shopping with Chewy is one of the things that sets us apart in the industry. ', 'From our knowledgeable award-winning customer service teams to our broad assortment of brands, to our fast one to two-day delivery, to the convenience of e-commerce, high-touch personalized experiences drive customer engagement, which fuels brand loyalty and repeat purchasing. Keeping the customer at the center of everything we do is core to our mission of becoming the most trusted and convenient online destination for pet parents, and the team continues to execute well against our strategy of long-term sustainable growth.', \"Now I'd like to share a few business highlights from our Q2. Given the rapid and consistent payback levels from our customers, we strategically invest free cash flow in new customer acquisition marketing. We are disciplined in how we deploy this capital, closely monitoring key metrics like acquisition cost and lifetime value. To that end, in the second quarter, we launched a new Data Management Platform, or DMP, to more effectively manage our investments across current and future marketing channels.\", 'Moreover, we consider our relatively low levels of aided and unaided brand awareness as an opportunity to invest in studying the market and customer inputs more thoroughly so that this research can form the foundation of a broader brand strategy in the future. We expect that increased brand visibility and awareness will benefit all marketing channels, including search, and our team is excited about this next phase in our marketing strategy.', 'In Q2, another area where we made significant progress was on the data and customer segmentation front. We consolidated all customer pet and veterinarian data into a single master dataset to create a proprietary customer data platform allowing for clean, reliable and consistently formatted data. Our marketing and merchandising teams will utilize this data for enhanced customer targeting and segmentation across all our platforms on site and mobile app.', 'Our team is constantly identifying new ways to improve the shopping experience for pet parents. To that end, we made further headway into launching new features on our mobile app platforms in the second quarter. A sample set of these include voice search to enable customers to conveniently find their products of choice using voice commands to search and browse, and navigation redesigns, which are now providing a consistent and enjoyable browsing experience across all our platforms.', 'Our newest business, Chewy Pharmacy, continues to deliver strong results and received favorable reviews from our customers who love our overall value proposition [Technical Difficulty]. We are also proud to be taking the leading position in a joint effort with manufacturer [Technical Difficulty] enforcement of minimum advertised pricing or MAP, in the pet pharma industry.', 'We believe that fair and transparent pricing across channels in this space is a big trifecta win for our customers, our suppliers and the veterinarian community alike.

Now I will turn the call over to Mario, who will provide a more detailed review of our Q2 results and walk you through our financial outlook. Mario?', 'Mario Marte', 'Thank you, Sumit. Good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results highlight our business philosophy and focused execution. Net sales exceeded $1.15 billion, an increase of 43% compared to $805.6 million in Q2 2018, and Autoship customer sales reached $799.6 million, an increase of 49% compared to $538.4 million in Q2 2018, outpacing growth in overall net sales.', 'We ended the second quarter with 12 million active customers, an increase of 3.4 million customers versus Q2 2018 and an increase of 1.4 million versus at the end of fiscal year 2018. Gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a 300-basis-point improvement driven by our disciplined execution to improve product margin and supply chain efficiencies. Q2 operating expenses were $355.3 million or 30.8% of net sales, increasing 240 basis points versus Q2 2018. ', 'SG&A was $244.6 million or 21.2% of net sales. As we have shared previously, SG&A for us includes all fulfillment and customer service costs, as well as credit card processing fees, and share-based compensation, a non-cash expense. Excluding share-based compensation expense in Q2 2019 and Q2 2018, SG&A as a percent of net sales increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 17.4%.', 'The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was largely driven by costs related to operating as a public company. Advertising and marketing was $110.8 million or 9.6% of net sales, scaling year-over-year as a percent of net sales as our marketing investments continue to be primarily focused on customer acquisition. As a result, the recurring and long-term revenue stream from existing customers allows us to increase our acquisition and marketing investments in absolute terms over time, while also scaling this line as a percent of net sales. ', 'Q2 net loss was $82.9 million, an increase of $19.8 million compared to Q2 2018. Our net margin was negative 7.2%, improving 60 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of share-based compensation in both Q2 2019 and Q2 2018, net loss improved $20 million or 33.8% and net margin improved 390 basis points year-over-year. ', 'Q2 adjusted EBITDA loss was $29.2 million, an improvement of $24.2 million compared to Q2 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was negative 2.5%, improving 410 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin reflect our ability to execute on the growth and margin vectors that we have previously shared with you and gradually scale our operating expenses at the same time. ', 'We generated positive free cash flow of $9.9 million in Q2 2019, comprised of cash from operations of positive $21.8 million, partially offset by capital investments of $11.9 million. In the second quarter, capital investments were primarily comprised of cash outlays for IT equipment, capitalization of internal labor and the launch of the Dayton, Ohio fulfillment center. We ended the second quarter with $150.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, including proceeds from the closing of our IPO, which added $117 million of cash to our balance sheet, net of underwriting costs.', \"Now I'll turn to guidance. As a reminder, fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year, while fiscal 2019 will be a 52-week year. This will impact year-over-year growth for both full-year 2019 and Q4 2019. We would also like to note that historically we build our inventory levels when we launch a new fulfillment center, and in the third quarter as we prepare for Q4 sales. This coupled with our favorable cash conversion cycle may lead our cash from operations to fluctuate from cash used to cash production between quarters.\", 'For Q3 2019, we expect net sales between $1.19 billion to $1.21 billion, representing growth of 36% to 38% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2019, we expect the following; net sales between $4.75 billion and $4.80 billion, representing growth of 35% to 36% year-over-year. Adjusted for the extra week in fiscal 2018, year-over-year growth is expected to be between 38% and 39%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year is expected to improve 420 to 450 basis points versus fiscal 2018. Included in our EBITDA guidance are costs related to operating as a public company.', 'We are excited about the financial and operating results for the second quarter. And with that, I will turn over the call to the operator for questions. Operator?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Brian Nowak', \"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, I think it's interesting you have a new Data Management Platform on marketing. I'd be curious to hear about as you're looking at data, what do you think are the one or two key factors you need to bring new pet owners onto the platform who are pet owners but not yet current buyers? How do you target those people?\", 'Then the second question is on healthcare. Walk us through sort of the roadmap to really drive more of your current buyers to start purchasing healthcare and pharmacy products from you guys. Thanks.', 'Sumit Singh', \"Hey Brian, this is Sumit. Good to hear from you. I'll take the first one and then I'll probably have you repeat the second question. On the marketing side, remember we target -- I think it's helpful to recognize that primarily our spend is acquisatory marketing, direct response. And so not only are we able to target across offline channels and online channels such as the classical TV and direct mail techniques, but also across an array of digital techniques, starting with kind of the Google network moving over to social media networks and so forth and so on.\", \"And because of the nature of our spend and the response pattern we're able to not only target, we're also able to attribute spend pretty accurately. And the investment that we're making in our marketing technology stack continues to refine that attribution so that we can essentially effectively recognize the fact -- we recognize already that our customers live full lives across marketing channels. So for us it's about reaching them and then optimizing -- or optimizing both their experience as well as our spend on our side. That's how we think about it.\", \"And then second question was around healthcare that was not [live] [ph] customers to start buying healthcare products. Yeah, it's a great question. I think, we think about it in multiple different angles. First of all, most of our current healthcare growth, which we're pleased with is coming via organic momentum, both organic momentum of the business as well as the exposure that we are bringing to our existing active customers on the proposition of health and wellness, a broad catalog of superior customer experience, and utilizing mostly our offline and some part of our online tactics to be able to reach newer customers.\", \"So I said two things there. On active customers, we're relying on, A, the great conversations we're having with our customers that our customer service teams are having with our customer base. We're also relying on the knowledge that we have more than 3 million pet profiles on file and the way that we -- and the fact that we have a connection and a direct reach into these customers.\", \"On newer customers, go back to the tactics that we deploy and there we're actively utilizing existing channels to layer on the proposition of healthcare, not just pharmacy because we recognize how customers buy and shop across either prescription diet or medication, but could also use the health and wellness supplements, et cetera, et cetera.\", \"And then last but not least, don't forget the site merchandising efforts that we put in. Rx Product Manager is an example that we put in our customer engagement there, is something that we measure pretty maniacally. And we're happy with the way that customers are engaging with that particular product, and across our site merchandising assets.\", 'Brian Nowak', 'Great. Thanks, guys.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Doug Anmuth', \"Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a few. Just first on gross margins, it looks like they expanded about 300 basis points year-over-year and then also 70 basis points sequentially. Can you just talk about the initiatives that are having the biggest impact there? And then how do you think about that as you're kind of approaching the low end of your longer-term target? And then on Autoship, a nice increase there to 69% in the quarter. Can you just talk about how much of that was driven around promotions around Prime Day, and then if there is anything early around retention for that cohort? Thanks.\", 'Mario Marte', \"Hey Doug, this is Mario. I'll take the first part of the question, and then Sumit will answer on the Autoship. In regards to second quarter gross margins, there are a few factors here at play. One is, as we've shared before, as we grow the scale and predictability of the revenue, enables us to lower the cost out of the entire supply chain, which benefits us and benefits our partners as well.\", \"The second item is that we expanded our catalog and we're always looking for additional product to include in our product offering. In the second quarter alone, we expanded the SKU count by about 10% and three quarters of that was in hard goods, which have a better margin profile as we've shared before. And the third one is the mix of sales. As the percent of sales that come from existing customer increases, that provides a nice tailwind to our margin. \", 'I would say, going forward, that we do expect promotional activity seasonality to cause some gross margin fluctuations from quarter to quarter.', 'Sumit Singh', \"Doug, this is Sumit. I'll take the second part of your question around Autoship. So we are pleased by the fact that 69% of our net sales came from Autoship. I think there are a couple different factors. And to hit the question head on, nothing of this number was really driven by promotions around Prime Day. \", \"This is a longer-reaching number. And so there are a couple different factors that are playing in here in the increase. One is of course, I'll pick up from the point that Mario mentioned as his third point, which is as the mix of sales increases, you're sort of seeing the power of active customers engaged with Autoship program over a larger base. So that's one. \", \"Number two, I think I'll repeat the two inputs that we're constantly improving and improvising upon. One is the assortment that we put in front of our customers that is eligible for Autoship. And then two is the fact that our recommendation and personalization engines continue to sense and our care [indiscernible] recommend better and more meaningful choices for customers to be able to interact into when they're browsing and engaging with our site.\", \"The third thing that we're seeing there, which is I think interesting for me to point out and for us to observe as an entity are the hypotheses that our healthcare customers are building complementary baskets and engaging in -- and the way that they are engaging with the Autoship product. \", \"It was our hypothesis that with our way of engaging with our customers, the tactics that we use, the way we educate them, the products we develop, and the way we communicate with them, the response pattern for Autoship should even be stronger for healthcare and we're seeing that come through. So without getting into specific numbers today, I think I can leave you with some of those nuggets.\", 'Doug Anmuth', 'Thank you, both.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Your line is open. Nat Schindler with Bank of America, please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Nat Schindler', \"Sorry about that. Probably expanding a little bit on what Doug asked. If you look at your gross margin growth and compare that also to your Autoship growth, one thing seems pretty clear is that you're actually not getting the benefit yet or it seems that you're not getting the benefit yet from mix shift towards your higher gross margin products, i.e. away from food. Autoship would mostly be food, I assume. \", \"If that's the case, how much more incremental margin do you think that you could get besides vendor efficiencies, which you seem to be driving these, how much more could you get just for simply increasing the share of your revenue coming from hard goods, house brands and also pharmacy?\", 'Sumit Singh', \"Nat, elaborate on that question. Before I answer it, I think it's a bit of a broad question. I started tracking with you, but I lost track of the question kind of midway. Can you maybe rephrase that?\", 'Nat Schindler', \"Well, okay. Actually, could you give us a little bit more data on your mix shift in the quarter? Are you continuing to see mix shift towards higher gross margin products like hard goods and pharma? And if they are not the major driver as you have said of gross profit, the 300 basis points improvement on year-over-year, probably because they're too small at this point, I'm guessing, how -- if they became -- in your estimation as you grow those businesses further, how much more could they contribute to gross margin?\", 'Sumit Singh', \"Got it, okay. Here is how we answer that question, right. The way we think about it is that we're going to go back to the way that we're executing our strategy. The first part is doing more of the same, which is the larger the base of active customers, bringing on more customers to the platform and growing our assortment in a meaningful manner, are sort of the first bucket that we always talk about.\", 'And so the expansion that you are seeing today is attributed primarily to those three. Right. The second bucket that we always talk about is expanding or the way that we are differentiating ourselves with, A, the healthcare segment, and then B, bringing private branded assortment, not that is competitive to our national brands but bringing private branded assortment that is differentiating to our customers and filling out voids.', \"These are two vectors that we fired that haven't fully landed. And my previous response to Doug was an allusion of the -- was alluding to the fact that our healthcare hypotheses is of course the fact that when customers interact with healthcare, we should be seeing them engaged with Autoship and build mixed baskets.\", 'So a small portion of that is starting to show through. Essentially our hypotheses are starting to show through. But not much to talk about there. And then the third vector was -- the third bucket is our strategy on vectors that we have not yet fired or launched, which are future expansions. Does that help answer the question?', 'Nat Schindler', \"Yes, but just to maybe nail a little bit what Doug said before, you're already at 23.6%. You only have 140 basis points to go to the low end of your five-year target. With more mix shift, shouldn't you easily exceed that and way before five years?\", 'Sumit Singh', \"I think the way that we think about it is, we provided a five to eight -- 500 to 800 basis point expansion opportunity from the 20 points that we exited 2018 at, so just to sort of baseline it. And the way we think about it is that bucket number one and two that I talked about, right, should get us -- as you're seeing, I mean that's the major progress that we're making. So that's where we're delivering the margin. And then a combination of bucket one, two and three essentially over the long term gets us to the upper range of that.\", \"And honestly, we continue to improvise and innovate. So at some part of this is, we're kind of learning our way into this. And as we learn our way -- as we learn stronger, we update our guidance accordingly.\", 'Nat Schindler', 'Great, thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Deepak Mathivanan', 'Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Two questions. So first, can you talk about the benefits of the new Data Management Platform and the master dataset specifically with respect to the marketing initiatives? Should we expect to see ROI improve from better attribution and targeting from these? Is that something that would show up in net adds over the next few quarters?', 'And then the second question related to SG&A in the quarter. It was a little bit higher than our forecast. Obviously some of that was due to SBC and then the new fulfillment center line. Are there other areas like transport management systems, maybe from a technology standpoint or actually initiative standpoint where expenses are meaningfully incremental? Thank you.', 'Mario Marte', \"Thanks, Deepak. So Sumit will take the first question. I'll take the second one on the SG&A. Actually, let me just try to answer the SG&A portion. I think to your point, the percent -- as a percent of -- SG&A as a percent of revenue, it did increase, but it is really limited to a couple of items. \", \"One is we launched the new FC in Dayton, Ohio. We also booked higher share-based compensation expense, and that was a $37 million increase versus Q1. And then we also began to report some costs related to operating as a public company. If you normalize for those three items, Deepak, you are basically at the same percent of net sales as Q2 last year. So really, it's those three items that drove the increase.\", 'Sumit Singh', \"And the first one, Deepak, on the DMP, so there's two things that happen, right. So we -- one, we internally have now created a master dataset that connects our pet data, our vet data, our customer data all at the same time, which is a pretty powerful combination to have, because if you think about us as -- I want us to think -- internally, right, Chewtopians know that Chewy -- we don't think ourselves as an e-tailer of products and supplies. \", \"We think of ourselves as building an experience-led proposition on the back of product technology and good data. And that's essentially the stepping stone of this. So when you have data like that, it allows you to do a couple of different things tactically and strategically. The measurements since we just put it in, there is not much data or measurement to talk about, but I'll speak to you on two fronts on how we seek to utilize this information.\", \"One is obviously allowing us to better -- segmentation ability gets better and our targeting gets sharper. As we do that, the efficient frontier -- for us to find the efficient frontier and drive efficiencies through our marketing gets better. So that's kind of your point on are you going to be able to attribute better. Yes. That's our learning hypotheses and that's what we are leading in with. \", \"Number two, what it allows us to do is build experiences. I mean, think about the fact that we have the millions of active pet profile data that allows us to connect and personalize that experience into a customer, but not just that, when we recognized health and wellness needs, we can actually surface that and connect the pet parent to the vet community. And that's the second angle that we're thinking of it there.\", \"So there is two there. And on the back of product and tech that we're bringing to the -- to our platform and to the marketplace, that's how we think about those two connecting.\", 'Deepak Mathivanan', 'Okay. Mario, if I can just ask you to elaborate sort of related to that point on with respect to the full-year guidance, obviously, you raised the full-year revenue guidance and gross margins continue to see pretty good tailwind, but the EBITDA margin was only revised like 20 basis points higher on the low end. I mean are there incremental costs that you think as you go forward for the rest of the year that we should be aware of?', 'Mario Marte', \"Deepak, the way I would answer is that we do have incremental costs, that we're beginning to see those reflected in the Q2 results and us operating as a public company, Things like insurance and professional fees, and filing fees and the like. But we've accounted for that in the guidance we provided.\", 'Deepak Mathivanan', 'Got it. Okay, super helpful. Thanks, guys.', 'Sumit Singh', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Brent Thill', \"Great, thank you. You've done a great job of adding customers to the base. I guess many are asking about the competitive differentiators that you're seeing that are helping to stand out. Anything new that you're seeing from some of the larger players in this space that have been notable, either headwinds or tailwinds that you're seeing currently? Thanks for taking the question.\", 'Sumit Singh', \"No problem. This is Sumit. I'll take that one. It's good to hear from you. I think it's -- we are completely focused on running our business, executing to the strategy that we've laid out and ensuring that our team is fully focused and feels empowered to go out and deliver the results that we seek to deliver. From that standpoint, as you can see, we're focused on the innovation, we're focused on bringing the customer base on, we're focused on differentiating ourselves, we're focused on the same vectors that we always talk about, the healthcare, the private brands, expansion of assortment, the experience building. I think now what you're starting to hear us also talk about is our emphasis on building products -- experiences on the back of product and tech. And that's how we see ourselves. If there is a more specific question, happy to take it.\", 'Brent Thill', \"Yeah, I guess, just anything new competitively that you've seen from anyone in the last couple of quarters that's changed your view in terms of what the landscape looks like?\", 'Sumit Singh', 'Nothing that I would characterize out of normal run of the business operation.', 'Brent Thill', 'Perfect, thanks.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Mark Mahaney', 'Thanks. Could you just drill down on customer acquisition costs? What you saw in the quarter? And then just talk about how you think those should trend going forward. Thanks a lot.', 'Mario Marte', \"Hi Mark, this is Mario, I'll take that question. No difference in the trends that we've seen in years past. Q2, some of the input costs tend to rise a bit there, TV [ph] is a bit more expensive in Q1 on a regular basis. And we've seen that in prior years. But other than that, we didn't see a significant difference in the acquisition costs. I would say if you look at what did happen in our active customers, we did see an increase, significant increase year-over-year; 12 million active customers at the end of Q2, a 40% increase versus Q2 last year. So we feel really good about where we are in active customers.\", 'Sumit Singh', \"Mark, this is Sumit. Here's what I will layer on, on top of that then. So when you think about -- recall the commentary on the way that we go to market today in a way that -- in both our targeting and our response is acquisatory in spend, and we are starting to lean in, recognize the fact that there is opportunity for us to take advantage of our low awareness numbers. And therefore connect the dots across lower, middle and upper funnels, and refining our approach and sophistication in how we go to market. So I think that's what we mentioned in the earnings script as well. So as we go learn, I think we'll come back and talk to you more about that, but we expect that to drive a lot of good learning into our engine.\", 'Mark Mahaney', 'Thank you, Mario. Thanks, Sumit.', 'Sumit Singh', 'Thanks, Mark.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.', 'Eric Sheridan', \"Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one about Chewy Pharmacy. Obviously it's still relatively early days, but curious about what sort of uptake of the product you're seeing. How are you thinking about that product maybe arching or changing the trajectory of customer lifetime value on the platform as people sort of adopt it? And what are some of the key investments you think you need to make as you look out over the next 6, 12, 18 months to make sure you're successful in that vertical, just so it's front of mind for investors? Thanks, guys.\", 'Sumit Singh', \"Sure. It's good to hear from you, Eric. First of all, what we know is that greater than 75% of pet parents out there have at least one pet that has a necessity for a health and wellness check or a health and wellness need in some way or the other. Recognizing that we also know that we have 12 million active customers and we're early in that stage. Our level of focus and investment has gone in two areas so far. \", \"One in understanding our customer needs and providing an assortment in front of them, and then tying that back with an experience and targeted marketing, which is where I think the comment that I made was that the Autoship subscriber rate into healthcare, the stickiness of that customer, the way that they're building baskets, our hypotheses across the board on these three or four different metrics that we're tracking, we're pleased with it.\", \"The type of investments that we're making is we are investing sometimes ahead of the curve to protect customer experience, and that's how we do business. And I believe that's the right way to do business. And in that, we are expanding our capacity. Last time I talked to you about expanding our presence in the Phoenix location. So we have -- so we're shipping out of Phoenix now. There our licenses have expanded. We have now licenses to ship to 40 states from our Phoenix location. So we're coming along as planned. \", 'And then in Q2, we also opened another location where we brought on a wholesale license. So at this point we have not only retail licenses, we also have wholesale licenses in the way that we want to service our customers, as well as our vet community.', \"I will say one last thing. Our focus on building products for not only for pet parents, but also for the vet community is something that we are completely focused on. Last time I spoke about the Rx product manager launch, which our customers are engaging with. As we continue to interact with each other, I hope to come back and talk to you more about the products that we're building for the vet community, which we believe should be tremendously powerful as well.\", 'Eric Sheridan', 'Thanks for the color.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'Brian Fitzgerald', \"Thanks, guys. A couple of questions on the Salisbury coming online, can you remind us how the tempo progresses there in terms of -- and how that's been trending from ground break to launch? And on the transportation management system that fully rolled out across all the FCs? \", \"Finally one more on the logistics side. Given the Ohio and North Carolina builds, how do you think about regional penetration or awareness differences and how do you think you can penetrate those areas and those opportunities where you're less densely populated with consumers?\", 'Sumit Singh', \"This is Sumit. I'll take a crack at that. So three questions there. North Carolina remains on track to open next year. No change there, nothing new to share. Second question is TMS. We rolled out TMS. We consider this a Phase 1 successful roll-out. And we are rolling it out in three phases.\", \"And the next two, we believe are fast followers and the full roll-out will happen before the end of the year. The third question is how do we think about logistics across Ohio and North Carolina build and how can -- I'm trying to recall, how can we penetrate those areas of opportunity.\", 'Brian Fitzgerald', 'Yeah, thanks. The question was around building more East Coast-centric versus West Coast-centric, and how you think about regional penetrations and awareness differences maybe across different regions, now you penetrate those opportunities?', 'Sumit Singh', \"Sure. I mean if you look at traditionally, logistics networks in North America are built to support where the demand and population density lies. So kind of roughly breaking down -- that breakdown is generally 40% on the East/Northeast, 30% Mid; 30% West. And if -- we're very diligent and very strategic about where we place FCs. We have a long planning process that goes behind it.\", \"We want to connect the logistics arc in the right way. We take -- we look at where our transportation partners are playing. We want to make sure that our click to deliver -- our delivery to our customers is fast, reliable. All of those factors go into play. And on the back of that is how we are thinking about launching Ohio and North Carolina. If there is something more specific that you're going for, just ask.\", 'Brian Fitzgerald', \"No, that's great. Appreciate it, Sumit.\", 'Sumit Singh', 'Great.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mark Kelley with Nomura. Your line is open.', 'Mark Kelley', 'Hey, great, thanks guys for taking the question. I appreciate it. The first one is, can you just talk about the labor market a bit? I know it remains tight. But it sounds like some areas are tighter than others, like Wilkes-Barre for example. What are your thoughts on just how competitive you are in the market?', \"And second, along with your DMP commentary, it sounds like you're continuing to build out the marketing tech stack. I was curious what else do you think you need at this point and what investments you still need to make there?\", 'Mario Marte', \"Hey Mark, this is Mario. I'll answer the first part of the question. In regards to labor market and how competitive we are, look, we believe we provide our nearly 11,000 team members with competitive wages, good and improving benefits, and a great working environment, and we strive to do that every single day. So from our point of view, we've been successful at attracting talent in all our locations.\", 'Sumit Singh', \"I'll take the second one. On our marketing stack journey, I would characterize as us being 70% of the way there. We have a DMP, a DSP identification software and all that stuff already hooked up together. And now it's about really connect back and understanding how we really -- rather than treating these as singular unit systems, how do we collectively go to market with smart segmentation and smart attribution in the back. That's what we have to do.\", 'Mark Kelley', 'Great. Thanks, guys.', 'Operator', 'There are no further questions.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. I want to start today with a brief business overview. I will then turn the call over to Dave for a review of our financials. Our top line performance and earnings fell well short of expectations in the second quarter. Specifically, comparable retail sales were down 10.5% in the quarter. While we experienced improved conversion rates in store, softer foot traffic in Q2 weighed heavily on sales.', 'Additionally, e-commerce comparable sales were down 6.4%, with each month improving over the last. As part of our efforts to reinvigorate our e-commerce channel, we recently took steps to reorganize our leadership team and continue to make upgrades to our websites to improve traffic and drive conversion. On the cost side, we made the difficult but necessary decision in June to take a reduction in force. This action alone is expected to generate cost savings of $4.5 million on an annualized run rate basis. This coupled with continued expense discipline across the organization, drove a roughly 10% year-over-year decline in SG&A expense. We also held gross margin rates roughly in line with the prior year, but as with first quarter, the sales miss in Q2 was too significant to drive incremental profit dollars. In short, our results this quarter illustrates the challenges that persists across the business.', 'Having served in the role of Chairman of the Office of the CEO since June, it has become clear to me that we need to take more prudent and decisive actions to preserve liquidity and ensure we position this business to drive profitable growth. In response, this morning, our Board of Directors announced that it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. Advised by Greenhill & Company, the Board will evaluate potential outcomes from the review, including but not limited to a sale or merger of the company, continuing to pursue value enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, capital structure optimization that may involve potential financing, and/or the sale or other dispositions of certain businesses or assets.', 'Our Board has not set a definitive timetable for completing the strategic review. During the review process, we will be focused on stabilizing our financial performance while the Company also continues to search for a permanent CEO. There can be no assurances that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any particular outcome. This Company does not intend to provide updates unless or until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Additionally, as a result of this action today, we will not be conducting a question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks on the call.', 'In closing, I continue to believe in this business and the strength of these brands. I look forward to working closely with the Board to determine next steps for the business.', 'I would now like to turn the call over to Dave.', 'David Helkey', 'Thanks, Lisa, and good morning again, everybody. This morning, I will review our fiscal 2019 second quarter and year-to-date performance and key items on our balance sheet and cash flow. Sales for the second quarter were $84.9 million, a decrease of $11.5 million or approximately 12% from the second quarter last year. The decrease in total sales resulted from the net closure of 34 stores and 143 leased apartments , combined with a 10.5% decline in comparable retail sales.', 'By channel, the comparable retail sales decline of 10.5% was brick and mortar. Comparable sales were down 11.9%, while e-commerce sales were down 6.4%. Gross margin for the second quarter was 51.4%, a decrease of 30 basis points from the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the growth of our e-commerce business compared to our brick and mortar business.', 'Gross profit for the second quarter was $43.6 million, a decrease of $6.2 million or 12.5% from the second quarter last year. SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $45.2 million, a decrease of $4.9 million or 9.9% from the comparable quarter last year and was 53.2% of sales versus 52% last year. The decline in SG&A in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 reflects reductions in employee costs and occupancy expenses resulting from the closure of underperforming stores along with ongoing expense reduction initiative. The net loss for the second quarter was $3.5 million or 25% -- $0.25 per share compared to a net loss of $4 million or $0.29 a share last year.', 'Adjusted net loss was $2.8 million or $0.20 a share compared to adjusted net loss of $1.6 million or $0.11 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA before other charges for the second quarter was $2 million, which was down $2 million from the comparable quarter last year.', 'I will now turn to our year-to-date results. Sales for the first six months ended August 3, 2019, were $179.1 million, a decline of $20.5 million or 10.3% from comparable period last year. Comparable retail sales were down 8.7%, which reflects the net effect of an 8.4% decrease in comparable brick and mortar sales combined with a 9.6% decrease in e-commerce sales. Additionally, sales were impacted by the previously mentioned decreases in store count.', 'Gross margin for the six months was 53.2%, an increase of 50 basis points from the comparable period last year. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven primarily by the pullback in promotional cadence, slightly offset by the previously mentioned growth of our e-commerce business. Gross profit for the first six months was $95.2 million, a decrease of $10 million or 9.5% from last year.', 'Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first two quarters of 2019 were $93.6 million, a decrease of $8.3 million or 8.2% from comparable period last year. The decline in expenses reflects a reduction in employee costs and occupancy expenses related to the closure of underperforming stores and ongoing expense reduction initiatives.', 'Adjusted EBITDA before other charges for the first six months was $8.7 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 26.6% from the comparable period last year. Net loss for the six months of fiscal 2019 was $3.4 million or $0.25 per share. For the comparable period last year, the net loss was $3.8 million or $0.28 per share. Adjusted net loss was $2.2 million or $0.16 per share compared to adjusted net loss of $0.6 million or $0.04 a share for the six months ended August 4, 2018.', 'Turning now to our balance sheet. At quarter end, inventory was $67.7 million, essentially flat to last year. And debt net of cash was $47.3 million, an increase of $12.7 million from last year. Through the second quarter of 2019, we opened one store and closed 13 stores for a net reduction of 12 retail stores. We ended the quarter with 446 retail stores.', 'Capital expenditures for the first six months of 2019 were $3.8 million, an increase of $1.2 million from last year. Year-to-date capital outlays were primarily the result of investments in the implementation of an OMS platform, combined with modest store investments as we optimize our real estate portfolio. These investments represent a measured and revenue focused approach to capital expenditures that will continue as we move forward.', 'That concludes our remarks for today.

I'm pleased with the progress we made in fiscal 2019 as we drove performance through an increased focus on our menu, the employee experience, and the continued expansion of our off-premise business. I believe our performance this year also reflects the strength and differentiation of the Cracker Barrel brand and of our ability to execute our strategic initiatives. This resulted in us outperforming the casual dining industry for the fiscal year, and delivering diluted earnings per share that grew 4.5% over adjusted EPS in the prior fiscal year, and exceeded our previously-stated expectations.\", \"Jill will discuss the financial results from the fourth quarter and our expectations for fiscal 2020, and I'll speak to you about our business priorities for fiscal 2020, but before that, I want to discuss some highlights from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter menu promotion featured Southern Fried Chicken, which as a reminder is the initial offering of our Signature Fried Chicken platform. This offering includes a generous portion of four pieces of hand-breaded bone and chicken with honey for drizzling, two sides, and a choice of homemade biscuits or cornbread. The promotion also featured summer sides, which included corn on the cob, bacon baked beans, and banana pudding for dessert. This promotion was supported by 12 weeks of national TV, with the ad emphasizing the handmade preparation and abundance of the offering.\", \"Additionally, a significant portion of our billboards featured fried chicken messaging. I was very pleased with the menu promotion and marketing campaign, which drove strong traffic and check growth. We continue to be excited about this offering, which has been well received by our guests as well as our operators. It will remain a key feature of our menu, and we're looking forward to further leveraging the new Signature Fried Chicken platform.\", 'Moving to off-premise, we again saw solid growth in this business. It was a meaningful contributor to the top line results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our third-party delivery coverage. This service was available in over 450 stores at the end of the fiscal year, and in conjunction with our Southern Fried Chicken menu promotion, we also featured a family size offering available for both in-store pickup and third-party delivery that proved to be very popular.', \"For the full-year, off-premise accounted for 9% of sales, an increase of 150 basis points over the prior year, and we believe we're on track to achieve our target of growing it to 10% of sales by fiscal 2020. I was pleased with our improvement in retail sales versus the third quarter. We achieved positive comparable sales growth across most of our merchandize categories with kitchen, dining, and home décor performing particularly well. Additionally, we once again grew our gross margin rate for the quarter. I think our retail teams did a great job this year in navigating through an ongoing challenging industry to deliver full-year growth in both comparable retail sales and gross margin rate.\", \"In the fourth quarter, we remain focused on our employee and guest experience, and we continue to implement several initiatives in our efforts to drive higher employee engagement, which we believe leads to a better guest experience. Improving the employee and guest experience was a priority in fiscal 2019, and I'm proud that the efforts of our field leadership teams and store employees, especially our PAR IVs. While we still have work to do, I believe we took meaningful steps this year that will help us achieve targeted improvements in the coming year.\", \"Fiscal 2020, we will continue to leverage our long-term roadmap to enhance the core, expand the footprint, and extend the brand, which we believe has helped drive our success, and will continue to drive performance amid challenged industry traffic and inflationary headwinds. As we enhance the core, we will continue to accelerate and invest in growth drivers such as off-premise. From a menu perspective, we plan to drive top line growth by introducing craveable signature food and evolving our menu to strengthen our dinner day part. We're also focused on further enhancing the employee and guest experience and ensuring that we continue to deliver on our brand promise, pleasing people.\", \"And in retail, our teams are focused on driving growth by providing unique product and driving conversion of dine-in and off-premise guests to retail purchases. Fiscal 2020, we will expand our footprint by continuing to open new units, both in core markets and in California. We've been pleased with the guest response in California, and we continue to work on adjusting our operating procedures to improve profitability in this higher cost environment. We believe our Extend the Brand strategy will drive long-term value creation through other growth drivers such as Punch Bowl Social. We're very excited about this strategic relationship and we believe our investment is yet another way we can drive shareholder returns. We continue to work on the Holler & Dash business model, and we believe there is great opportunity in the breakfast and lunch focused fast casual segment.\", \"Now, I want to speak to some of the highlights of our fiscal 2020 business plans and priorities, and I'll start with our plans to enhance the core. Our Q1 menu promotion features our Homestyle chicken. This popular offering of two pieces of boneless chicken breast was previously only available on Sundays, but we are now making it available every day as part of our Signature Fried Chicken platform. Additionally, we introduced a new Homestyle Chicken BLT that is also a part of the promotion and features our Homestyle Chicken with a maple glaze topped with bacon, sweet n’smoky mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a bun. The menu promotion is being supported by national TV, with the ad continuing our strategy of more explicitly highlighting our food and value.\", \"If we look at build on recent menu successes, such as the rollout of our Signature Fried Chicken platform, one of our culinary initiatives in fiscal 2020 is the evolution of our menu. Dinner has been our most challenged day part, and while the planned enhancements impact both lunch and dinner. This initiative is targeted at strengthening the dinner day part by introducing new Signature craveable items, while also simplifying our menu to increase consistency and execution, and to provide a more optimized menu that better highlights our abundance, value, and variety. We'll be taking a phased approach with this initiative, which we believe will support the successful incorporation of the enhanced menu into our daily operations. I'm excited about this initiative, and we plan to have this test in a substantial portion of our stores in the second-half of the fiscal year.\", \"Our next priority is the accelerate off-premise growth through further expansion of third-party delivery, and improving off-premise customer journey. We've been pleased with the demand for third-party delivery, and we plan to make this service available in an additional 150 stores by the end of the fiscal year. Key focus in fiscal 2020 is improving the off-premise customer journey to ensure we are executing at a high level as we see continued growth in this business and that we are consistently delivering on guest expectations. To do this, we have several initiatives planned that are designed to strengthen our execution and create a better more seamless guest experience.\", 'A heightened focus on our employee and guest experience will remain a priority in fiscal 2020. We will continue to leverage our PAR IVs, who are important leaders and mentors within our stores, and our organization is keenly focused on consistently delivering high levels of hospitality and service, which we believe is both a key part of our brand and a differentiator.', 'Looking ahead for retail, our teams remain diligent in their commitment to improving retail sales, unique product offering, and by converting both dine-in and off-premise guest to a retail purchase. We plan to improve our conversion rates through a number of tactics such developing floor sets that quickly capture guest attention by providing additional merchandized offerings that easy to grab and often priced around the $5 mark.', 'Additionally, we will continue to support sales growth through our improved value assortments through retail offerings that provide our guests with products that are both stylish and functional. I am excited about our Christmas assortments, which include both traditional and whimsical merchandize where guests can find unique offerings at price points that easily fit within any budget.', 'Lastly, I want to speak to the strategic relationship with Punch Bowl Social that we announced in July. We believe this investment provides another growth vehicle by allowing us to enter a new and expanding segment to our non-controlling interest in this award-winning highly differentiated brand with strong growth potential. We are excited about the relationship, and we believe we can help Punch Bowl Social scale and reach its potential through this partnership. A Punch Bowl Social management team continues to operate its business from its Denver headquarters. We will provide input and strategic advice, but our main focus remains Cracker Barrel.', 'In closing, I am pleased with the progress we made in fiscal 2019 and in particular with our fourth quarter results. I believe our fiscal 2020 business priorities along with the continued strength and differentiation of the 50-year-old Cracker Barrel brand will continue to drive shareholder returns in the current fiscal year.', 'Jill Golder', \"Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sandy. I would like to begin by discussing our financial performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and then our outlook for the 2019 fiscal year. In this morning's release, we reported fourth quarter net income of $65 million or $2.70 per diluted share compared to prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.19 which excludes the impact of the 53rd week in the prior year quarter.\", 'For the full fiscal year, we reported net income of $223.4 million or $9.27 per diluted share, representing a 4.5% increase over the prior year adjusted EPS of $8.87. We reported EBITDA of $390.4 million for the fiscal year compared to $376 million in the prior year adjusted for the extra week. For the full year, we generated nearly $363 million in cash from operations, which allowed us to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders in the form of declared dividend that totaled approximately $195 million in fiscal 2019.', 'For the quarter, we reported total revenue of $787.1 million, an increase of 4.6% when compared to prior year revenue of $752.5 million adjusted for the 53rd week impact. On an adjusted basis, our restaurant revenue increased 5.4% to $650.1 million and our retail revenue increased 1% to $137 million. Our total revenue increase was driven by positive comparable restaurant and retail sales and the net opening of seven new Crackle Barrel locations.', 'Cracker Barrel comparable store restaurant sales in the quarter increased 3.8%, as average check increased 3.6% and traffic increased point 22%. The increase in average check reflected menu price increases of approximately 2.3% and to favorable menu mix impact of 1.3%. The fourth quarter mixed favorability was driven primarily by our Southern Fried Chicken offering and the growth of our off-premise business. We were again pleased with our off-premise business, which grew over 20% compared to the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter comparable store retail sales increased 0.4% with increases coming primarily within our decor, kitchen, and dining categories.', 'Moving on to expenses, total cost of goods sold in the quarter were 28.8% of total revenue versus 30.3% in the prior year quarter. Our restaurant Cost of Goods Sold was 24.6% of restaurant sales, a 140 basis point decrease versus the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower levels of commodity inflation and leverage for menu price increases. On a constant mix basis, our food commodity costs were approximately 0.2% higher in the quarter than in the prior year quarter, driven by increases in pork, fruits and vegetables and dairy.', 'Our retail cost of goods sold was 48.7% of retail sales, compared to 50.1% in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of reduced use of markdowns. Labor and related expenses were $276.2 million or 35.1% of revenue compared to $286.7 million or 35.4% of revenue in the prior year quarter. This 30 basis points decrease was primarily driven by cost savings initiatives and improved productivity.', 'Other store operating expenses in the quarter were $164.5 million, or 20.9% of revenue, compared to other store operating expenses of $160 million or 19.7% of revenue in the prior year quarter. This 120 basis point increase was primarily the result of planned depreciation increases related to investments in our strategic initiatives, and our decision to reallocate advertising dollars to the fourth quarter to support our summer menu promotions.', 'Door operating income was $119.9 million in the fourth quarter, or 15.2% of revenue compared to store operating income of $118.2 million, or 14.6% of revenue in the prior year, quarter.', 'General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $40.5 million, or 5.1% of revenue, compared to $35.4 million, or 4.4% of revenue in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation.', 'Operating income was $79.4 million, or 10.1% of revenue, an increase of 11% over prior year quarter operating income, adjusted for the impact of the 53rd week of $71.5 million or 9.5% of sales.', 'Net interest expense for the quarter was $3.9 million, compared to $4.3 million in the prior year quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 13.9% compared to an effective tax rate of 21.8% in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by the reduction of the statutory rate from the announcement of prior year tax reform.', 'Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the fiscal quarter with $36.9 million of cash and equivalents compared to $114.7 million at the prior year quarter end. This decrease was primarily driven by our investment in Punch Bowl Social. Our total debt was $400 million dollars at quarter end.', 'Before providing our fiscal 2020 outlook, I would like to speak to our investment in Punch Bowl Social. As we announced in July, we will be investing up to $140 million dollars to acquire the initial non-controlling stake and to provide growth capital for future development for Punch Bowl Social.', 'Punch Bowl Social is a highly differentiated brand with strong growth potential. These units have targeted AUVs of $7 million to $8 million and targeted new unit store level EBITDA excluding pre-opening of 17% or higher. It currently has 18 units open and expects to open an additional six units by the end of fiscal 2020. While Punch Bowl Social expects to have positive store level and company level EBITDA before pre-opening expenses in fiscal 2020. We anticipate their operating income will be negative in the near-term, due to pre-opening expenses.', 'Under the terms of the deals, we purchased approximately 58.6% of the economic interest and approximately 49.7% of the voting interests of the company. Our initial controlling stake was purchased for approximately $89 million. The remaining portion of the investment is to provide growth capital in the form of an interest bearing loans.', \"In addition to the third-party financing that Punch Bowl is arranging, we've agreed to provide capital of up to $140 million, inclusive of the $89 million for the initial non-controlling stake. We are excited about this investment. As we believe these unit economics combined with the potential for over a 100 domestic units are highly attractive, and we believe this investment is another way we can drive long-term value creation.\", 'We look forward to partnering with Punch Bowl Social to help us scale and achieve its potential. With that being said, with the growth brands such as this, there can be business impacts and timing shifts that lead to variations in near-term financial performance.', \"With respect to our fiscal 2020 outlook, everyone should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties associated with this outlook, as described in today's earnings release and in our reports filed with the SEC. For fiscal 2020, we expect to report earnings per share excluding any impact from Punch Bowl Social between $9.30 to $9.45. We anticipate that our investment in Punch Bowl Social will have an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.50, driven primarily by pre-opening expenses.\", 'Taking these impacts into account, we expect to report earnings per share between $8 and 80 cents, and $8.80 and $8.95. Although our guidance for Cracker Barrel as soon as industry performance for the full-year, similar to what we saw in fiscal 2019. Our near-term outlook is cautious due to the softening trends in the industry traffic and comparable sales in recent months.', 'Our earnings estimate assumes total revenue of approximately $3.15 to $3.2 billion reflecting anticipated comparable store restaurant sales growth in the range of 2% to 3% and comparable store retail sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect to open six new Cracker Barrel stores in fiscal 2020.', 'We anticipate our fiscal 2020 menu pricing will be approximately 2%. We expect increased food commodity costs on a constant mix basis in the range of 2 to 2.5% for the fiscal year driven by unfavourability in the dairy import categories.', 'We have locked in our pricing and approximately 45% of our commodity requirements for fiscal 2020 compared to approximately 50% at this time last year. Our retail teams are working diligently to mitigate the impact of tariffs, and while we expect tariffs to be a headwind, we anticipate that our retail margin as a percent of sales for the full fiscal year will be approximately flat compared to the prior year.', 'We anticipate fiscal 2020 wage inflation on a constant mix basis of approximately 4%. We anticipate net interest expense of approximately $14 million. This decrease compared to the prior year has driven by the benefit of interest income resulting from our lending to Punch Bowl Social. We expect an effective tax rate for the fiscal year of approximately 17%, which assumes the renewal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.', 'Taking these assumptions into account, we expect full-year operating income margin of approximately 9% of total revenue. This guidance includes a target of $11 million to $13 million in business model improvements resulting from sustainable cost savings. We anticipate that capital expenditures for the full-year will be approximately $115 million to $125 million, and that depreciation will be approximately $110 million to $115 million. Our guidance implies an increase in fiscal 2020 EBITDA of approximately 1% to 3% compared to the prior year.', 'And with that, I will turn the call over to the operator so that we can take your questions. Thank you very much.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Alton Stump', 'Thank you and good morning..', 'Sandy Cochran', 'Morning.', 'Alton Stump', 'Congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could just give us maybe a bit more color if you can on how much of an impact the new fried chicken product had on either mix and/or comps in general, and kind of what we should expect or potentially should expect over the course of full-year?', 'Jill Golder', \"So, good morning, Alton, this is Jill. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the fourth quarter we had positive check growth, approximately 2.3% was from pricing, and then additional check growth both from the Southern Fried Chicken and our growth in off-premise. So they were -- those two were split approximately evenly about 60 basis points to 70 basis points each in growth. So, we would expect some favorable mix into fiscal '20 from both of those drivers, but probably not to that level.\", 'Alton Stump', \"And then just real quick follow-up and I'll hop back in the queue. Just as far as your commodity guidance 2%-2.5% for the full year, should we expect -- is there a major volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis or should it be in that range for the bulk of the year?\", 'Jill Golder', \"That's a great question. So as we look at the quarters, for next fiscal year we've got commodity inflation in the range of 2% to 2.5%. The increases come primarily from two areas, higher pork due to the African swine fever, primarily driven by bacon, and then we also have dairy increases, which is driven by butter and cheese. We do expect some deflation on eggs, and that's primarily in the first half of the fiscal year from a favorable locked position that we have on shell eggs, so what I would say is you'll see some slightly lower commodity inflation in the first half of the year versus the back half.\", 'Alton Stump', \"Great, that's very helpful. Thank you, Jill.\", 'Jill Golder', \"You're welcome.\", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead.', 'Jake Bartlett', \"Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first question is about your guidance for same-store sales in 2020. I know your compares get significantly more difficult as '19 progresses. Just trying to gauge your level of confidence and maybe as part of answering that, if you could help us with the cadence of same-store sales throughout the quarter in the fourth quarter noting the kind of the differences in marketing spend versus the prior quarter? And then any commentary on current trends would be helpful.\", 'Jill Golder', \"So, as we look at our guidance for fiscal '20 on same-restaurant sales, I want to go back to the fact that what I said in the script is, for the year, we were expecting the industry performance to be similar to last year, but in the near-term we're more cautious, especially given some of the consumer trends that have been published in Knapp-Track through August, where we've seen some softening. And so, if you think about some of the impacts that might be impacting the consumers, the tariff impact, the recent oil price impact represents a risk to us. So, I would say is, as we think about cadence in the near term, we're more cautious. So, and then - and then on the current, the fourth quarter, we're not going to talk about our monthly trends.\", 'Jake Bartlett', 'Okay, but that commentary about the industry trends, we could reasonably assume that you imply your current trends would follow that sort of trend?', 'Sandy Cochran', \"We're just making a comment about the industry, Jake.\", 'Jake Bartlett', 'Got it. And then I also had questions about the implications of the Punch Bowl Social investment on your capital allocation strategy, and just you ended the quarter at a much lower cash level than you typically would have. Did you expect to take up your debt levels throughout the year? And then as also part of answering that, any changes or impact it would have on your planned share buybacks? I know that your current authorization is about $50 million, and any plans that the impact that could have on your dividend strategy?', 'Sandy Cochran', \"I'll start, Jake, and then turn it over to Jill if there's anything additional she wants to add. And I'll start by stepping back and just kind of summarizing the position that the Board – the longstanding position that the Board has had relative to capital allocation, which is that we first invest in our business, and then we look to have a sustainable, competitive regular dividend, a share repurchase plan as appropriate. We've just recently been able to do more volume in share repurchases, and then we've announced an expanded share repurchase plan. And then as part of our strategic initiative to extending the brand, we've looked at ways to make investments in the business that we felt would drive long-term shareholder value, which is what you see with the Punch Bowl Social investment.\", \"So, when you take all of that into play, additionally our targeted debt levels have been in the 1.5 times to 2 times for quite some time, and we're currently below that, so I think the investment in Punch Bowl Social was a use of cash which we are optimistic that it will be a long-term value driver. And so, I think that the Board will continue to operate within that framework as it sees opportunities, and we'll continue to navigate through an environment where we're trying to sort of balance all of those different demands on capital. We do talk about it at ever board meeting. So, Jill, I don't know if you want to add anything else to that.\", 'Jill Golder', \"So, Jake, I think what I would add is around the color with Punch Bowl Social, just to kind of walk you through the investment that has already been made, and then kind of how that $140 million that we talked about in our July press release and then we reiterated on the call. So, as a reminder, of the $140 million investment commitment that we talked about, $89 million was for our initial non-controlling stake, which was made in fiscal '19. Then that remains there's $51 million is for growth capital. And of that, we provided approximately $15 million in '19. So that leaves approximately $36 million remaining on that.\", 'Jake Bartlett', 'Got it, yes, thank you very much.', 'Jill Golder', \"You're welcome.\", 'Jake Bartlett', \"That's helpful, thank you. Appreciate it.\", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Gregory Francfort', \"Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I just had a couple. The first, maybe going back to the capital allocation, I think your CapEx is coming down a little bit next year, can you talk about the POS system and the rollout of that and how you're thinking about timing, and I think there's an opportunity to, and I may be wrong, but to consolidate more of the operations across restaurant and retail when that gets done, and so I guess I'm just curious the current timing plans on that. Thank you.\", 'Sandy Cochran', \"Why don't you go, Jill?\", 'Jill Golder', \"Okay, well, I'll start, and then Sandy can add. So, currently, we have 110 restaurants have our new POS system. In fiscal '20, we plan to roll approximately 50 more out to the system. And we continue to be pleased with the new POS system. It's easier for our team members to use; it's easier to train them on. We believe that this technology will enhance both the employee experience as well as the guest experience given the other enablers like tablets. So for example, what we've been doing, as we've looked at the rollout of our POS is we've been trying to pace it appropriately with other initiatives. I know we talked about that in fiscal '19, where we purposely slowed it down with the chicken initiative. And so, as we look to fiscal '20, we're trying to appropriately pace it.\", 'Gregory Francfort', \"Got it. That makes sense. And maybe just on Punch Bowl, I guess you're just under 50%. And in your guidance for with the $0.50, let's assume it stake is an unconsolidated affiliate or as you provide growth capital that pushes you over 50% and then it consolidates on your books and you are assuming you kind of fully bear the cost. I guess I'm trying to figure out like how you're thinking about that impact. And then, just as a -- I guess as a follow-up to that, I would imagine that the pre-opening on some of these boxes high. I think normally pre-opening comes in a little bit south of a million dollars, should we think of it in the kind of $1 million to $2 million range? Is that kind of a rough approximate range to think about pre-opening for store?\", 'Jill Golder', \"So Greg, this is Jill. I mean, I think there's kind of two questions in there. Let me start with the accounting treatment. So, we are accounting for Punch Bowl Social using the equity methods. So the way you will see that on our P&L is we'll have and it'll be aggregated on a net income line, which will say income or loss from unconsolidated investments. You didn't see this in fiscal '19 given the fact that we closed on the deal, right at the end of the fiscal year. So there was really no material impact on the P&L there. And that is our expectation of how it will be reported in fiscal '20.\", \"So, as we look at our guidance for fiscal '20, and we were trying to provide clarity for you all, in '20, we expect Cracker Barrel to come report EPS of $9.30 to $9.45 that excludes the estimated impact or investment of Punch Bowl Social of approximately $0.50. So then when you combine Punch Bowl Social, the implied EPS, the GAAP EPS then would be in the range of $8.80 to $8.95. To your point on Punch Bowls openings, given the fact that it's a growth brand, that as pre-opening expense, it also adds some uncertainty around the timing of pre-opening. There can be shift that impacted, so given those uncertainties, as we look to guidance, we recommended that -- we recommend that investors really focus on the EPS guidance for our core brand of $9.30 to $9.45.\", 'Gregory Francfort', \"I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you for the thoughts. I appreciate it.\", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.', 'Jeff Farmer', \"Great. Just following up on Punch Bowl, I appreciate what you just said about potentially how to model this moving forward, but so concept is expected to see that $0.50 per share headwind, I think that's roughly $12 million in net income in '20. So the question is based on the pace of Punch Bowl unit development, and theoretically increasing pre-opening as you get to '21, '22 and beyond, could that dilution number get bigger as you move past 2020, or I'm sorry, FY '20 or is there some other offset that could show up to reduce that $0.50 headland?\", 'Jill Golder', \"Yes, so as we said in our comments, Punch Bowl Social is a high growth brand. And so, we would expect to see pre-opening expense for some coming years, but beyond what we provided for fiscal '20, we're not going to disclose anything else beyond '20.\", 'Jeff Farmer', \"Okay. And then, I heard you mentioned that the DNA dollars, you guide into the DNA dollars, but G&A I might have missed it, looks like G&A dollars, were up 5% to 6% '19. I think that was materially higher than the revenue growth rate for the year as you think about G&A growth in FY '20, is there any color you can provide there?\", 'Jill Golder', \"So, G&A in the fourth quarter was primarily from incentive comp, and so we expected in FY '20 to be approximately flat as a percent of sales.\", 'Jeff Farmer', 'Okay. And then, the last one again I apologize if you touched on this but fairly large in the fiscal fourth quarter in support of the fried chicken as moved into the fiscal first quarter. In terms of media wait, TV weeks, however you want to provide the information? What can we expect in the fiscal first quarter versus what you just saw in the fiscal fourth quarter?', 'Jill Golder', \"So in the first quarter for marketing spending, we've added a couple of media weeks versus prior year, but nothing significant.\", 'Jeff Farmer', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Bob Derrington with Telsey. Please go ahead.', 'Bob Derrington', \"Yes, thank you. Sandy, I probably -- we're probably spending too much time on Punch Bowl given, so much we don't know about it, but I'm just curious the fact sheet you all originally provided us around the brand, basically called for, I think it expected new openings on 11 by the end of calendar 2020. The company's guidance, I think, is now for six new units in the fiscal year. So how do we reconcile the two? Does that mean, there's four more or five more plan for between the end of July and the end of the calendar year next year?\", 'Sandy Cochran', \"Yes. it's the difference between our fiscal years.\", 'Bob Derrington', \"Okay, all right. And I'm curious, are you comfortable with the unit economics of the brand, and the reason I asked that question is the -- I guess for the 17 units that are opened currently, I think that if the pack, she calls for an average about 23,000 square feet, which I guess at the estimated sales per store, that implies only a sales per foot of roughly about $330 per foot, compared to Cracker Barrel, which is well over $500. So I'm just curious, your perspective on this.\", 'Jill Golder', \"So hey, Bob. This is Jill. So as we look at the Punch Bowl, we believe there's solid unit economics, they're targeting AUVs of $7 million to $8 million. They have -- some stores will certainly exceed that their targeted store level EBITDA is 17%, or north of that. They're also -- we just opened or they just opened their first 10,000 square foot box or their smaller box and they are testing. So we'd like the unit economics.\", 'Bob Derrington', 'Can you give us some perspective on the capitalized cost per new store?', 'Jill Golder', \"No, we're just -- we're not going to get into a lot more detail that will leave that to some future discussions, and maybe we'll get into it in the Analyst Day, but we also think to add to Jill's point that there are some opportunities to improve the economics. First of all, with the learnings that we're having about the geographic differences in the models, how to improve the efficiency of models. So in their current portfolio, where we are pleased that the newest boxes are performing as strongly as they are, and we believe we can add value in terms of purchasing and some other cost structures, to even further improve the business model going forward. And as we understand more, and as we get further into this investment, we will update you all and give you a lot more detail about the company and its economics.\", 'Bob Derrington', 'Got you. If I could follow-up real quickly on the -- Jill, your comment about the near-term outlook based on things like Knapp-Track, et cetera, was there any impact in any way from the other hurricane that recently went up the Eastern Seaboard, either through loss of power or store closures, customers, transitioning, any kind of commentary there, was that a driver on this?', 'Jill Golder', \"Yes, Bob. Thanks for your question. We felt very fortunate that damage to our stores and our employee's homes was minimal from the hurricane. The impact was mostly to sales, and we believe that was in materials, but all of that is contemplated in our guidance.\", 'Bob Derrington', 'Got you.', 'Jill Golder', \"But I think what makes the -- an event like that difficult for us is that if you look at how many stores were closed, and for how long is one thing, but we can't quantify it, but we know we were impacted by are the people who change their travel plans, and then didn't make the trip down to Orlando. For example, so we didn't get the opportunity to have a meet with us along the route. And so, I do think that the storm, it went on for quite a long period of, a couple of weeks, and it was over Labor Day. It didn't help the trends in the industry.\", 'Bob Derrington', \"Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Jon Tower', 'Great. I just have a few, if I may. First, when thinking about the marketing cadence for the year, I know Jeff had asked something earlier on the first quarter, but given the fact that last year was so fourth quarter heavy with respect to marketing spend, how should we think about it rolling out through the balance, or for the full-year of 20? Should it be evenly split, or will there be certain quarters where there might be much higher ratings?', 'Sandy Cochran', \"Well, we always tend to put higher ratings in the second and fourth quarter, because those are just been much more important to us from a traffic standpoint, supporting the holiday period, and then summer travel period, relative to those comparisons to per year, I guess, in general, in FY '20, we expect our advertising expense to be relatively flat with prior year. One of the things we do is as the year progresses we do kind of think about shifting some of the dollars around.\", 'Jon Tower', \"Okay. And then, just going back to dinner, it's been a sore spot for the business over time, and it sounds like you're attacking this with some new products in 2020, and in the back-half of the year, some menu simplification, but I think you've also said in the past that, at least in previous calls, that greater competitive discounting has also been an issue for some of your dinner traffic. So when thinking about either product evolution, or how this menu is going to be framed, in the latter half of '20, should we expect these products to kind of address that value category more aggressively. And same thing with either the menu featuring value or advertising, perhaps supporting value more or so than in the past?\", 'Sandy Cochran', \"You are absolutely right, Jon, that the amount of discounting historically in the industry has certainly been a pressure, and for our competitors, they're only operating in the dinner day part. So that's where we probably feel it the most. Our work on the dinner menu is that we're attempting to do a variety of things. First, we plan to add new capable signature items. The Signature Fried Chicken platform is the first and maybe the best example of the kind of thing we're trying to do there. We are planning to delete some items, so that we're not adding additional complexity to the menu, and to allow our operators to improve and continue this consistency and the execution of the menu. But as we redesigned it, we want to highlight the value that is on our menu every day. So there we're looking at a new category called 899 Home Cooked Classics. It will -- we believe deliver a lot of value to our guests and it will be available every day. We will highlight some of our Cracker Barrel favorite section with in a way that we believe is easier for our guests to understand and to be honest, easier for our teams to deliver on the Brill side and on the server side.\", \"And then, we're looking at things like we're going to go ahead and we'll put the breakfast -- a component of our breakfast menu on the dinner menu to reinforce our breakfast all day category, some people because it's two different menus don't necessarily understand that breakfast all day and food that's complicated for our posts to provide to menu. So we're trying to accomplish a lot in the dinner refresh, but absolutely have in mind that we reinforce and highlight the value that we believe is so important to the brand and to our guest.\", 'Jon Tower', 'Great, thank you for the color. And the last piece I have is more of a clarification. The growth capital that you are providing for Punch Bowl Social, is that included in the CapEx guidance for the year of $115 million to $125 million?', 'Jill Golder', 'No, it is not.', 'Jon Tower', 'Okay, thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question is a follow-up from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Gregory Francfort', 'Hey, guys. I just had two quick other ones. The first is just on the retail business and margins, can you maybe frame up what the magnitude is of the tariff impact you are assuming? And then, I think you talked about retail margins being roughly flat next year kind of where the offsets are and what are the key initiatives that are driving that as offset? Thank you.', 'Sandy Cochran', \"We won't quantify the specific tariff impact. I can tell you that the teams have been working hard to identify ways to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. And when I say mitigation, first, we are evaluating whether we could source from different countries. We are working with vendors to identify ways to reduce the cost in some cases. We are working to in some cases no longer stock a particular item if we think that the price increase necessary would make it not sort of interesting to our guest. And then lastly, we are looking at where and how to increase prices on the floor. So, there is a lot of work being going on. I think the broader concern about tariff is whether in general costs across the board go up for our guest and it results in them in having less discretionary income which could affect the frequency and the way they think about eating out.\", 'Gregory Francfort', 'Yes, got it. That makes sense. The other last question I have. Just on the To-Go business, you had a couple of years of added push on To-Go. Can you give any thoughts or extra clarification on how that consumer is using the brand differently than your in-store consumer? Either frequency of that visit per year or a quarter or month, how do want to describe it? And drink attached or any other sort of ways they are using the brand differences or similarity that you are seeing helpful to just give us a broader picture? Thank you.', 'Sandy Cochran', \"That's a good question. I am trying to -– I don't think we yet understand how the frequency changes. I will make a couple a comments and Jill you can add to it. Individual To-Go continues to be the biggest component of our off-premise business. And within that, third-party delivery has been a surprisingly big part of that business. And we do believe that that is largely incremental.\", \"We have been pleased with the growth that we are having in the catering and the celebration meals. We have made a big investment in that with our catering vans and our catering services managers. And we hope that in fiscal '20 we can continue to build on that. I know our retail team is working hard to try to find ways that we can get retail attachment with off-prem when they come in and -– because we don't see right now the same level of retail attachment. And I know the off-premise team is working hard to try to drive things like beverage or a dessert, or upselling, and adding size, and how we can do that through either the digital app to do a better job of recommending or through the scripting on the phone when we are taking a call. I would say in general we don't see the beverage attachments with To-Go sale that we do with dine-in just in general.\", 'Jill, do you want to add anything to it?', 'Jill Golder', 'No, I think you covered it, Sandy. Thank you.', 'Gregory Francfort', 'Thank you, you guys for the thoughts. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'The next question is a follow-up from Bob Derrington with Telsey. Please go ahead.', 'Bob Derrington', \"Yes, hi. Just a quick accounting one, Jill, as we are looking at depreciation, that line I guess last year in fiscal '19 was up almost 15% at about $107.5 million. Fiscal '20's guidance is for only about the range you are providing implies a 2% to 7% growth on D&A. What's going on within that line? Are you running off some things? Is there much in a way not coming on? I would have thought some of the technology initiatives would be -- in the POS could be adding to that?\", 'Jill Golder', \"No, it's a great question, Bob. As you know, our depreciation had been stepping up as our capital steps up from our planned investments to support our growth initiatives like the platform for the chicken as well as the coffeemakers, some of the POS. So, a number of areas where we have been investing. You can see that our guidance for overall capital steps down next fiscal year versus this fiscal year. So, some of the slower rate in growth and depreciation is due to the fact that we plan to spend less in capital.\", 'Bob Derrington', 'Got you. And Sandy, as it relates to the dinner refresh, are those things –- some of the changes within the alterations within the menu designed to use some of the equipment that you invested in this past year supporting the rollout of your chicken platform?', 'Sandy Cochran', 'Oh, absolutely with the chicken platform just to the question what you just asked, the investment last year in equipment and installation of the fryer, the breading stations, the hot holes that was significant. And it was always intended to be a platform that over a period of time, multiple years adding to. So we started with the Southern Fried Chicken bone-in. We have just gone to homes the Every Day and this Chicken BLT Sandwich, which is awesome. We will be doing fried turkey again this holiday, which was very successful last year. And our new platform, I think will allow us to do it even at higher volume and with more consistency and easier on the back of the house. Then, we plan probably actually in the next fiscal year to be adding hand batter bread in tenders which we can use in themselves and on salads. So, we have a variety of initiatives planned by the culinary team over a period of time to leverage the investment that we made in the whole system of fried chicken.', 'Bob Derrington', 'Can you fry an entire turkey in one of those?', 'Jill Golder', 'No. [Indiscernible] we brought it, and our people do that.', 'Sandy Cochran', \"No, it's the turkey breast that we offered last year over the holiday. It's absolutely delicious.\", 'Bob Derrington', \"Down in the south, that's pretty popular item. Thanks, Sandy.\", 'Sandy Cochran', 'Thank you, Bob.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our prepared remarks.', 'Sandy Cochran', 'Thank you all for joining us today. As we look forward to 2020, we plan to build on our brand strength and execute our business initiatives to drive sales and long-term value creation. We appreciate your interest and support. And we thank you for your time this morning.', 'Operator', \"The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\"], ['Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI) 28th Annual Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference  September 17, 2019 11:20 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Jim Meyer - Chief Executive Officer', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Unidentified Analyst', '…with our next presentation of the conference, a slight scheduling change for those of you who are looking at the agenda, this is not David Frear. This is Jim Meyer, the CEO of Sirius XM. And so, he has graciously agreed to sort of [pinch in] [ph] for us. So, we’re going to just go ahead and wing it, how about that?', 'Jim Meyer', 'That’s great. ', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Well, thanks so much for being back.', 'Jim Meyer', 'I got up this morning, I apologize for my complete casual day, I got up this morning and thought, I don’t have anything to do, but work in the office today and thought really go casual, and then, David had a problem, and so, I came down here. So, anyway, hopefully it will be just as interesting.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Unidentified Analyst', \"I think we should go causal at the conference anyhow, so you’re supporting my theory. We’ll jump into and we’ll start with some high-level stuff. You know when – you know you closed the acquisition of Pandora for $3.5 billion and when you closed the deal you became really one of the largest audio entertainment companies in the world. You now reach over 100 million users. And so, just from a strategy standpoint, what is the company's long-term plan to be a provider of audio entertainment? And how does Pandora fit into that big picture strategy?\", 'Jim Meyer', 'So, as I thought about the acquisition of Pandora and thought through the opportunity and multiple discussions with the Board, I think central in those thoughts were a couple of things. Number one, as you already pointed out, I felt like we needed to get bigger to be able to play in this business going forward. You know when you talk to the music labels, probably the most important thing to them is hey, help me break new artists and certainly this platform now, as you pointed out, 100 million listeners positions us very, very well there.', \"So, I wanted to get bigger. This got us bigger overnight. Second, it gave us a major position in streaming, which – by the way I’ve spent 10 years telling, for instance, the OEMs, how crappy the Pandora algorithm is, is actually really good. And so – and now they say, well, that’s not what you said a couple years ago. Well, I was wrong a couple of years ago. The technology I'm really impressed with, but for me, one of the most important parts of this acquisition, one of the things that excites me so much about the audio entertainment business is I think there is a long, long, long runway for audio entertainment, and by that I mean I'm really confident my grandkids are going to consume audio entertainment and I’m going to go away and let them I’m really confident their grandchildren are going to consume audio entertainment.\", \"What we don't know is, how will it be monetized. And so, to me to be a leader, mid-term and long-term in the audio entertainment space, you need to get good at both the subscription side of the business, which we already are. Trust me, we can do a lot better, but we’re pretty good at it. But you also need to be good at being able to monetize the business through advertising or promotion. We were nascent in that business. We have good sales force, but our advertising revenue at Sirius was like 3% of our revenue.\", 'Now, you know, we’ve got a very large digital audio advertising business. And so, one of the things I love about the position we’re in is, we’ve got now two very powerful revenue engines. And we can more – mold, move to whatever that way is that ultimately next generation, next generation, next generation consumers choose to allow these business to be monetized, and I want to be a leader in both of those.', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'So, now that you’ve been integrated for, it is a little while here, you talked about the ability to pursue some, I guess cross promotional, cross product synergies. What’s your insight at this point? Where do you think the most immediate obvious opportunities are going to be for these two businesses to show a little bit more product synergy together beyond what we’ve already seen navigate?', 'Jim Meyer', \"So, I’ll give you both the positive side and the hard work side, okay. On the positive side, we’ve been able to take out cost much quicker than I expected, and with much less pain than I expected. So, please don't misquote me. I mean taking out costs is always difficult, but it’s come quicker. Frankly, the team at Pandora has contributed more to it than I would have initially expected to how we can, you know we could get much more efficient and move forward, and so, I’m pleased with that.\", \"Second, you know we've already basically bought back all of the shares that we issued to buy Pandora, so I feel like for investors it's almost like a free ride going forward in terms of the value of Pandora. And so, because of those two things – and I think this is a big deal for the first time in the history of Pandora. Pandora will be EBITDA positive in the second half of this year and is accretive now to our EBITDA, which is a great thing.\", 'Obviously, core in our thesis is that we need to stem the decline of listeners in the free business, and I really should have mentioned that when you asked my – earlier, I really want the free business, okay. I really – again I want to have a big subscription business and a big free business and I want to be able to take advantage, and I mean our companies, to take advantage of listeners as they migrate between those and monetize them no matter where they are, okay. And I think we’re going to get better and better at that.', \"We’re just digging in and we’ve only owned the company a little over six months, it’s almost seven months now, and we’re just really digging in on the listener decline, and it’s going to take work. It’s a solvable problem and I'm confident we’re going to get at it, but we’re going to have to stay at it and work at it.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'What do you see as real positive? What are the most immediate things you think that if you get right, you’ll start to see those trends improve?', 'Jim Meyer', 'So, what is root cause or just a lot of other things out there? You know, if you think about the all the other places you can go get free music starting with YouTube and work your way through Spotify, I hate Spotify, but you know the – that’s a surprise you can call me on that one, but as you work your way through it, those are all really good products. And so, we, first and foremost, have to make our product better, and we have some interesting things coming later this fall that I think makes the App functionally better and makes it easier to find content within the App.', 'The second thing, which is really one, two, three, four and five in my opinion is what do people listen, it’s all about the content. And so, I think what we’ve been able to do at Sirius over many, many years is build a really strong robust suite of content that consumers have found engaging and worth paying for, and that’s what we’ve learned. If you take content, make it interesting to people and make it easy to use, particularly in the car, they’re willing to pay for it.', \"On the Pandora side, we will add more and more content to compliment the algorithmic driven stuff. We will add more curation, which we also think is helpful. And an example is, we – you know we’ve announced a deal with Drake. It's a big deal. I mean, you know I've been doing this a long time, how successful it will be, we’ll see. I think we’ll be really successful. Drake is really fired up on this thing.\", \"We met with Drake and his manager in LA last week. They’re really, I think, coming at this the right way and in an exciting way, but I can tell you I don't think we would have had a relationship with Drake if it wasn't for Pandora, and that is Drake wants to be on a mammoth platform if he’s going to do the kinds of things he talked about. And so, I’m really excited. So, obviously, the key thing to get listeners back is content. Particularly, we also believe spoken word besides curation can help quite a bit. It obviously helps a lot on the Sirius XM platform.\", \"The third area is, the brand has not been invested in very well in the last three, four years as Pandora has fought its way through significant financial issues. I think probably the area that suffered the most was investment in the brand, and we’re looking at a lot of different ways to be smart about attacking that and [indiscernible]. And then finally, and again, this is another thing like the algorithm I joke a little bit about, but you know I’ve spent 12 years lying awake at night worrying about Pandora's place in new vehicle production.\", \"It turns out I should have slept just fine, it's not good, it’s not good. And so – and if there's one thing I think we do really well, we do a lot of things well, we have some they could certainly do better, but we work really well with the OEMs; we work really well on the in-car experience, audio experience, and I think you will see us focus more and more there, and I think obviously, there's a real opportunity to increase listeners there. So, hard problem, ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to tell you, not an easy problem. You are going to have to be patient with us as we work through it, but in my opinion, a solvable problem that we will get to stabilize and then get to terms.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I want to follow up on the OEM side. I guess first, just maybe any feedback you’ve gotten from the OEMs to the extent this has been a part of your dialogue with them about how they think about integrating Pandora? And then, you’ve never said its about having Sirius in Pandora, you said, its about having subscription and free, right. So, I guess the other way of approaching this is, you’ve got a huge opportunity to have a free presence in the car. And so, is it by definition the Pandora brand or there are multiple ways you can go after that now with the assets you have?', 'Jim Meyer', \"Well, I – it’s a great question and I think we’re working our way through that as you ask what our alternatives are. I do know one thing, we’re going to run, you know, trials in the mid-20 million, let’s just say next year assuming the economy holds, right and between used and new cars. We’re going to be thrilled if 35% of those becomes subscribers, okay. So, the way I look at that, just to make the math easy, we’re saying that 16 million, roughly of those people, okay to go wherever you want, not okay. We should be – if you don't want to pay in a subscription business, we should be working you hard than to get you into our free funnel.\", \"What that free funnel will look like ultimately? I'm not sure. Will it only be Pandora? Will it be a blend of Pandora and a tease of some Sirius XM free? I don't know. I can tell you one thing, as we get people into that free funnel, you can certainly expect that we will promote to them on a fairly regular basis the value of our subscription, the Sirius XM and attempt to get them back up. But we’ve got – we just got to get things to settle down a little and I’m positive the logic is correct, the implementations is not simple.\", 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Right. We’ve obviously acknowledged you’re not pleased with the direction of listener hours at Pandora, but the RPMs have actually trended very nicely. They were up 17% year-over-year.', 'Jim Meyer', 'Really pleased with them.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Could we dig into that, what’s driving that?', 'Jim Meyer', \"So, I think there's – it’s not ad load and we’re really comfortable where the ad load in the product right now. I’ll tell you something else, the Pandora team has some really smart people, I mean like people that teach the stuff at Berkeley at a Ph.D. level, okay, on the how to optimize ad load versus revenue, okay. And so, I'm really comfortable that we understand those dynamics where we've made progress and where we have a really strong digital ad sales force, I mean a really good one.\", \"I’m actually – I’m leaving here and having lunch with them as soon as we leave with our key management team from that sales force, but I'm really impressed by how – you know the tools they have, how they conduct themselves and their results. Where we’ve made progress? So, specifically to answer your question is, we didn’t have programmatic really as a vehicle to sell, we now do. And so programmatic has helped us.\", \"Video advertising is a much higher modernization than some of the other ads that we’ve run. We've done really, really well with video. And then, finally, quite candidly we’re just doing a better job of optimizing the ad space that we have and delivering that to our customers when they want it. I mean we’re just are operating better. And so – and I don’t see those trends falling off going forward.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I mean, essentially what I think you were just starting to allude to is growth in addressable right, and we’re still in very early stage there. So, where do RPMs go in a market where you’re addressable right?', 'Jim Meyer ', \"I don't know. I mean, you know, I – obviously we’d like to test our pricing power there and we’ll probably, you know, and not probably will experiment some there and see what we can do. You know, I am going to tell you our weakness. In the subscription business we, me, David, a few of our team, we’ve been at it so long that I'm much more comfortable kind of understanding the dynamics of the difference between price and its impact on certain things. \", \"We've seen a lot of price increases go through and kind of understand the elasticity. On the advertising side, I still got – we still got to learn that a little more. And so, I want to be careful that we don't lose any of the momentum we have while we go out and test that. Ultimately though, we’ve got to fix the listener hour decline. Oh! One more thing I like to comment on too, we had great success with off-platform advertising.\", 'So, for instance, as you well know, we sell all of SoundCloud’s ad inventory in the United States, and we have a revenue sharing agreement with them, that’s been great for us, and I certainly want to grow and expand the off-platform business as well, which if you think about it is, is a clever way to use that skill that we have.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is sort of a synergy questions, sort of a scale question, but the new company now offers music a lot of ways. You’ve broadcast satellite, paid streaming, ad supported streaming, on-demand and there’s different mechanisms for you to pay for all of that content, and considering how scaled you are, you noted how much more meaningful you are to artists and to music producers, they are an opportunity now to kind of restart the conversation about how you pay for all this to maybe make it more efficient?', 'Jim Meyer', \"You know, my position in the last three years and I've been pretty vocal about this is, I am trying really hard to have a good relationship as opposed to an adversarial relationship with the music labels, and I believe that works both ways, okay. So, I'm certainly not going to say that with the size of our platform, do things our way or you know we’re not going to do certain things. That's not what this is about.\", 'What I think is true is the labels understand our size and how important that is to them and we understand how important the labels are to our business, trust me. And so, honestly all I’m looking for as we work through that is a little bit of an unfair advantage in certain places.', \"You know an area where I still think a lot of listeners can be moved over to a monetizing funnel that is better for the labels and better for Sirius XM is continue to take listeners from terrestrial radio. And so, I think that's where you will see a lot of our thinking and our focus over the next 12 to 18 months.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Alright. Let’s talk about the Satellite Radio business? Sirius has added… ', 'Jim Meyer ', 'A really good business.', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'I was about to say you’ve added 1 million subscribers for each of the last eight years. You’re targeting approximately a million subscriber additions this year. At high level, what’s continuing to drive momentum in this business? Why has it been so sustainable?', 'Jim Meyer', 'So, first I want to say – thanks for that question. I want to – I am really confident in our guidance this year, okay, and subscriber’s revenue, EBITDA and cash flow, okay. So, let’s get that one off the table. In terms of growing at 1 million subscribers, I still see good growth in the Satellite Radio subscription business and I’ll tell you why I see it. Number one, we’ve never been a stronger position than the automobile.', \"We’re, you know our new car penetration next year should get to 80%, will get to 80% by, you know mid to kind of the middle of the year towards the third quarter, around it, please don’t hold me of the exact month, but it's – there's no doubt where it's going and we have a 120 million satellite radios in the fleet factory-enabled today. That number is going to 220 million, you know, if the industry keeps moving.\", \"Why is that important? The used car business for us now is really hitting its stride and ultimately opportunities from the used car funnel ought to get bigger than the new car funnel ought to get bigger than the new car funnel if you’re around long enough because the new car business this year, and so you have [indiscernible] there's all kinds of numbers out there, I know that everybody is going crazy, you know, about the car business, its down, its down 1%.\", \"I mean like, I love the business where it is right now, okay. And the used business is just as strong or strong. And so, between there, we have a steady and reliable funnel of trials coming that we've had good success on converting over. I think the other area though is our churn performance, I’m quite proud of. You know we have a big team that works on it. We’re really, really focused on it.\", 'We’ve made a lot of improvements in our service this year to add more value for our subscribers, and as investors are looking at our business over the longer term, three to five years, it is my goal to find that next step down in churn, which is going to be hard to do because our biggest part of churn is vehicle turnover, which is going to happen independent of us, but we can do a much better job if you think about it.', 'We know those vehicles can turn over. We can do a much better job making sure that relationship in that vehicle as it turns over moves over to the new vehicle that person buys and keep track of where that vehicle that get sold where that goes and to make sure we can get a relationship there. And so, I’m really pleased that where we are in churn and I think – you know, we know the number one element that drives churn is engagement.', \"When customers are engaged, they churn less. It’s kind of a no-brainer I mean who really pays for things, they don't really want it or don't really use, alright. I mean some of us do, but it’s done, okay. I mean most people don't pay for things they don't engage with. We’re really focusing more and more on engagement with one primary goal and that is we hope you could find that next stair step reduction in churn.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Well, one of the ways you're trying to drive more engagement on the Sirius brand is with streaming. In other words, you can stream this when you're not in the car, so it would seem like if you can drive that engagement wouldn’t that help lower churn, meaning if I don't think about Sirius as the service in my car, but as the service that I just use just because I change my cars I'm probably not going to be changing service into that scenario?\", 'Jim Meyer', \"Absolutely. And you know and I will admit in front of all of you, we didn't move quick enough, early enough on streaming. We are moving quick now, okay, trust me. If you at our apps in the marketplace, I couldn’t be prouder. If you look at the Stars performance either on, you know, in the Apple Store or the Google Store, how our apps are doing, you look up to take up every month now. You know our core customers that are now, not only listening in the car, but streaming our product elsewhere, it can’t help.\", \"I mean it’s got to help because inevitably it's got to help engagement, and I'm really pleased, and I think you can expect to see even more and more from us in the streaming area, and that’s only helped quite naturally by the Pandora technology as well. You know, in our latest streaming product that’s out there, we have a service for our premium customers called artist radio powered by Pandora. I particularly love the product.\", 'It is so simple and so easy to use. Of course, there are no ads in it, which for paying customers is – we know is what they demand and want and I think you’re just going to see more and more enhancement to our streaming service. We’ve got Howard Stern’s video out there, for instance. Howard, you know, I spoke to him a couple weeks ago, is really excited now about his works, you can see it. you know I don’t know what the next step is, that’s what he gets to do, but I – he’s a genius and he will figure out, I know, some exciting stuff in that area.', 'You guys should expect more and more video to roll-out now over the remainder of the year. It will be – you know we’re not going to get in the television business or the movie business, right. It’s not what we do. Our video will be all about enhancing the audio experience and really aimed at again trying to create more value for our customers and trying to make them engage more in the product.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Do you have large enough dataset yet on your subscriber streaming engagement to know whether it’s having an impact?', 'Jim Meyer', 'Not yet. But I could tell you we’re beginning to see really nice uptick in the amount of customers that are streaming. We know – I can tell you that customers that both listen in the car and stream at home do churn less, okay. And so, you know, I might not be the smartest person, but I know when something works, we got to be going to drive that and you should expect us to keep driving that area because like I can tell you, churn and unlocking churn if we can be successful is a really good way to continue growth once you get to a very large size on any subscription business. ', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"I can go back to something you’ve talk about, the 80% penetration of new cars, an element of that is the agreement you signed the Toyota where you're going to be off-standards. So historically, you haven't necessarily been in every single model of the manufacturer because some of the cheaper models were not necessarily going to convert. Is it just Toyota is unique? Or do you actually think that off-standard might be a more compelling model for your distribution going forward?\", 'Jim Meyer', \"So, I think two things. One, we will – we’ve been chasing the SAC curve, right. And so, the cost to put equipment in the vehicle has been dropping, you know, pretty consistently, right, and I think you've even seen a couple of quarters out of the last five where absolute SAC dollars were actually lower than a year earlier. That changes your thinking in the business. And so, you know, when the SAC is a certain level, we were really careful about making sure it was clear even with a wide safety barrier that we were going to get our money back in terms of putting that money in the vehicle.\", \"Two things have happened. One, the SAC has come down, and the second, we now realize the opportunity in the second, third and fourth owners. And so, the ability to get our [bait back] early on has dropped quite a bit. So, I think Toyota is obviously the first step. I can tell you when an automaker goes standard; it makes dealing with that automaker much simpler in terms of both on the engineering side and the marketing engagement side. It makes it easier for the sales people at retail to work it through. And so, you know, I don't know where this will go, but I certainly would like to see some more off-standard deals at the right economics.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I’m going to talk about your ARPU. That’s been a good story, it grew 4% year-over-year in the second quarter, which is above what would have been a historical trend in maybe 2% to 3%, so I guess the question would be is this increasingly price driven? Is it mix driven? And maybe just at a higher level, how are you thinking about the right contribution of ARPU growth to your revenue growth going forward?', 'Jim Meyer', \"So, we run the business for cash flow. Like I can tell you that and so I don’t – I obviously look at ARPU as a measurement, but I don't – I don't – for instance, I don't pay our teams based on ARPU achievement, okay. We do have other measurements that we think takeaway kind of some of the – some of the tricks that can be played with ARPU. You know I think we can really drive ARPU with a much lower subscription base, right, and not optimize revenue or cash flow. So, that's not all what I'm interested in.\", 'I’ve been please where we are in terms of our revenue growth. It’s obviously a combination. We have put through some price increases. We are also seeing an improvement in our mix. And so, the answer is it’s both and we, you know we are very careful about feeling our way through that and experimenting with certain things and seeing how customers react before we roll it out in that areas, in the ARPU area.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Right. And so, you know, historically your business has shown a high degree of operating leverage. You are experiencing some margin pressure in the satellite radio business this year. Can you just walk us through the moving parts? You know why that being experienced? And then, just longer term, do you feel like that historical operating leverage is going to remain intact? Or are there some differences we need to be accounting for?', 'Jim Meyer', 'I absolutely think in that mid-long term that operational leverage is not only core to the story, the investments story in my opinion. It absolutely will be utilized. What I will tell you we are really focused on this value, creating more value for our customers. You know we have a great business on the Sirius XM side. We think that we can improve that business even more by giving our customers more value. And so, for instance, allowing our select customers to stream in the short-term, hurts EBITDA, doesn’t help EBITDA because the cost of streaming is now observed in there.', \"We've added content cost to make the video business grow. We’ve added content cost for a couple of the other initiatives that we have in there. I'm really confident those are going to pay-off. And how are they going to pay-off? They’re going to pay-off in the two most obvious ways you mentioned that these are going to give us more price, flexibility, and they're going to give us the ability to do better and manage that customer – life of that customer in terms of churn, dynamics, and we’re just going to have to balance those going forward. But I think we’re really onto something. I really think that we’ve – we know our customers when they perceive more value, they churn less, and obviously, they're willing to pay more. And so, I think you’re going to see that's we’re all about in the next couple of years. \", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'So, you see the long-term operating leverage of the business intact. CapEx is a bit elevated now mainly because of the satellite replacement program.', 'Jim Meyer', 'That’s of the satellite radio business. Obviously, when Pandora comes in there…', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Correct.', 'Jim Meyer', 'We’re still waiting to see where that ultimate EBITDA margin comes in, comes out.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Correct. I guess I just want to get your thoughts around CapEx. I mean is it going to be the historical cadence as you go to replacement cycle, we see CapEx improve? Are there some differences in the way your business mix is evolving or maybe there will be opportunities to take your very rich free cash flow and accelerate some CapEx?', 'Jim Meyer', \"So, one, our CapEx is not going to be higher than it is right now, okay, if you're planning our business going forward. Second, we do have two satellite launches next year to replace two satellites in the upper band, okay. They – in the XM band, okay. They – we also have a spare that we’ll probably have to deal with sometime over the next three or four years. And then, the Sirius fleet will also become due kind of, you know, call it the 20, we have to begin probably in the 23-time frame. \", 'So, I think what you’re going to see is you’re going to probably see after we get these satellites launched, you know, a little bit of a reprieve, and then, probably backup to the levels we’re at again for a couple years, and then another reprieve after we get through that. You certainly are not going to see anything above where we are today.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And other than satellite is there anything that you’re looking at from a growth standpoint that would require you to put a little more capital into the business?', 'Jim Meyer', \"We – you know I’m always amazed at how much money can go into IT and IT technology, and by the way, I think it's one of the reasons why our business is operating as well. We put in a lot of really good tools for our managers. Those tools are extensive, so we continue to invest in that area, but I don't see it at a higher level than it is today, and the answer to your question is no, I don't see anything else right now. I certainly don’t see it.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"So, if you look at your balance sheet, leverage right now is 3.2 times, net debt-to-EBIDTA, which is almost a full turn below the four that you’re comfortable operating at, and really you haven't been a lot higher than this for a long period of time. And so, do you still think that four turns a leverage is where you target the business over the long term? Or is there anything about your business mix that suggests maybe the current area is more comfortable for the company?\", 'Jim Meyer', \"So, I guess I will say it this way. For the right opportunity, there is no reason why our business can't do really well, still at four turns a leverage when you look at our cash flow and where it is. So, the way I look at it, it gives us – it gives our Board a really strong tool, okay, that can be used if the right opportunities come along, and we decide to lever out before those opportunities. I'm actually pretty pleased with where our leverage is right now.\", \"You know, even with what we’ve done with Pandora, even with what we’ve done – by the way, I'm really pleased with the debt ladder we have and how we’ve been able to refinance it over the last several months, we think gives us a really strong – put this way, we never want to be where we were in 2008 again, okay, and I have a long memory, okay. So, we feel really, really good and I think that leverage target is there if we find a really good reason to use it. I don't know what that reason might be today yet.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Well, that’s what I wanted to explore, so coming down to the end of our time here, I mean it’s not just that you got balance sheet capacity, you’re generating $1.6 billion of free cash flow. So, the liquidate profile the company is very robust. You talked about a lot of ways you think you could grow this company more over time. I mean if you're looking for M&A opportunities, is it fairly clear you want to stay audio entertainment? Are there things that are tangential? Really, what are the criteria you typically use to say this would be accretive to what we do?\", 'Jim Meyer', \"So, we are not a conglomerate. We don’t – we don’t understand – we are not built to run a conglomerate, okay. We are not built like a private equity company or to some extent some of the Liberty companies that own, you know Liberty Media owns a lot of different things, right. We are in the audio entertainment space. We have found opportunities that are tangential to that like the connected vehicle space where we get one plus one being more than two and that business – one of the reasons I have been in that business, our OEM customers asked us to be in that business. They asked us for help in those other, so they don't run subscription business. They don't run churn models, except for GM, rest of them don't do it, okay.\", 'And so, we are able to help and make profit and make us more important to the OEM. So, that’s kind of the way I think about it. The way I think about the use of our money, whether it is cash, capital or open to buy whatever it might be, open the bar up is, first and foremost are we making the right investments internally in our business, and we are investing heavily both in content, marketing and development of product.', \"So, I feel and particularly on the satellite radio side, our path forward on the platform of new vehicles is very strong, which let’s all this stuff other stuff happen. Okay. We look at everything in terms of acquisition. Everything, okay. And I’m not afraid of any of them. They got to meet, the board has pretty strict criteria for what they want to see and those acquisitions and we have conversations with the board every quarter, kind of what’s out there and what we’re looking at and today I don't see anything right there that is substantial, another 3.5 or 4 billion kind of acquisition.\", \"And then finally, return of capital. And I think we’ve been pretty consistent about $2 billion kind of return of capital. As you know, our target had kind of been [indiscernible] dividends, I mean share buyback and 200 million in dividends. Our share price, I thought, and our board thought dropped to a level that made it a very attractive investment opportunity for us for earlier this year, and so our buyback was much higher than the normal rate. I think you're going to see probably our buyback and our dividend policy kind of still stay. Ultimately it will still smooth out back into that kind of same 2 billion a year.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Because if you don't find something to buy, you get into this perpetual conversation about couldn’t you buyback more stock. But then your float can shrink this so much it would be gone, I mean under what scenario would you look at the dividend say, we're prepared to a company where actually the dividend is a more meaningful part of what we deliver to shareholders?\", 'Jim Meyer', 'So, we have that discussion every quarter with the board. We have two discussions every quarter with the board. We will at the Board meeting in the second week of October for instance, we will remind the independent board members, which I think is really important and you want me to do this – not want me to, we need to make sure we do this, and that is, what does, you know Liberty has created backup to over 70% now, okay.', \"We remind our board every quarter with outside experts what does 80% mean and what does 90% mean. So that we just don't slip into those things without being very respectful of what that would mean to independent to the other shareholders of the company. I don't know what Liberty’s long-term goal is. I think Greg is talking here, you got to ask him. I mean, certainly it’s a discussion we have at the board level.\", 'We also have clearly had this discussion about what happens when we get to a certain level of buyback where either the float is affected to where it as a problem or Liberty may not want to go anymore, higher than that or we may not want Liberty to go any higher than that, right. The board may not. Would be put more in dividend. All those things are on the table. I don’t have – I don’t have any big statement to make on them today, except that they are all there and they are all certainly within our graph.', 'I think there are lot of examples of where very big company’s growth begins to slow and dividends become a more important way to compensate investors, we’re not there today, we may be someday, I don’t know. And so, I like having options and a lot of optionality so that our board can thoughtfully and make those choices and reward shareholders.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Jim, thanks for being here today.', 'Jim Meyer', 'Thanks very much.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'That was great.'], ['AT&T, Inc.

So Randall, John, welcome to Communacopia.', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Thank you, Brett. I would like to thank you for inviting me this year. So Brett told me last night, it’s my 11th year just to speak at this event, so.', 'John Waldron', 'It’s great. We appreciate. A lot of continuity.', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Yes…', 'John Waldron', \"We expect that to continue. I guess I am supposed to prompt you for some Safe Harbor language. So I'm going to prompt you for Safe Harbor language…\", 'Randall Stephenson', 'So before we begin, I would draw your attention. There should be a Safe Harbor statement up here. Some of our comments may be forward-looking subject to risk and uncertainties, and results may differ materially. And you can find further information out on our Web site.', 'Question-And-Answer Session', 'Q - John Waldron', \"Thank you. All right. So let's start with the big question around Elliott. And you’ve obviously given your perspective on what they think, what’s going on with the company. Just give us your perspective and what would you say to audience about where you're on the Elliott announcement?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"We -- obviously, you probably have seen the comments that we made publicly Monday after receiving a letter. And we've shared the letter with the Board, and the Board has discussed it in depth, obviously, and look it out from our view. So it's a mixed bag. There are some things in the letter that we look at and see, and it makes a lot of sense. And we need to push further and talk about it. There's some other areas, you look at it. And as you would guess, it's not quite as clear in terms of how that would make sense for us. But I mean look, these are smart guys, right? And these are smart guys, and they put a lot of ideas into the paper that we need to sit down, engage with them on. And at the end of the day, we're going to evaluate it and talk to them and see what makes sense for all of our shareholders. So that's kind of where we are.\", 'John Waldron', \"Okay, good. All right. Let's talk -- let’s get into strategy and what's going on inside AT&T. You recently reorganized, which has been a subject of some of the press. Some of the focus in the Elliott letter and more broadly, is around the strategy of owning a media company and a network company, and really trying to put those together. And you've been on the forefront of really trying to integrate those two models. Can you just give a sense for why you think that's the right strategy and how you've been thinking about pursuing in that direction?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Sure. In terms of the strategy, it's premised on a couple of really basic ideas or beliefs, I guess I would say. And belief one is, we believe people are going to spend more and more of their day watching premium content over the next few years. That’s been going on for the last 10 years, and we are seeing no indication that this is going to change. People are going to consume more content. As a result, we are absolutely convinced people are going to consume and expect to demand more bandwidth, more connectivity to watch that content. And if you believe those -- we kind of think those two beliefs are maybe unassailable, I mean, they’re kind of basic…\", 'John Waldron', 'Pretty fundamental…', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Pretty fundamental. If you believe that, then you got to like the assets that we put together, a premium media and entertainment company with I think the best large scale distribution business in the United States. So the question is the one you asked. Does it make sense to vertically integrate, to actually own both of those? If you had asked me that question, John, five years ago, it’d probably been hard pressed to make an argument for why it made sense, in the old world.', \"In the new world, we think it makes all the sense in the world. In fact, we think a company that can put together premium media, content creation and production with networks would have a significant strategic advantage. And the reason is the content creation business is changing, and it's not changing by a little. It's changing rather radically. And so while the consumer is going to continue to consume more and more premium entertainment, all of the growth is happening digitally.\", \"And so if you're a content creation company and you're making content to distribute in the old world, which cable, satellite, even movie theaters, that's probably not a very rosy picture for a content creation company. But if you're a content creation company and you have a direct line of sight, a direct path to a large set of consumers, then you have a unique competitive advantage. And that's the play we're running here, because if you just reflect on what exists within WarnerMedia, it's an amazing set of capabilities and assets, and is one of the largest scaled TV and film production houses studios in the world.\", \"Really -- there's just a couple that might be able to compare to them. They have an intellectual property library that is as deep and as broad as anybody's, covering all genres that you can conceive of. Think about HBO, the tastemaker brands within HBO and how unique that asset is. I think unrivaled relationships with critical talent around the industry.\", \"Now think about taking that and standing up a digital platform, which is the play that's being run by John Stankey and his team, a digital platform, HBO Max, will be the name of it and we'll be introducing it on October 29th. It's going to be really exciting. This is going to be different. This is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is not Hulu. This is different. Standing up a digital platform and driving fast penetration through customer relationships that you own in this distribution business. We have 170 million customer relationships, whether it's pay-TV, whether it's our broadband service or our mobility service, particularly.\", 'And so standing this up and driving penetration through that distribution platform we think is a very powerful opportunity. We have 5,500 retail stores where we touch customers every day. And in fact, if you just go through the numbers, we touch these customers 3.2 billion times every year. Do you think you can drive penetration of this kind of product fast through that, and if you want just a couple of data points.', \"We really had the business and begun integrating it for about a year. We had to keep the businesses separate after the trial till we got through the appellate process. We're about a year into this and just the old traditional HBO products. In the course of a little over a year, AT&T is now already by order of magnitude the largest distributor of HBO in the United States. In fact, if you go to the number two distributor, our penetration is 67% higher than the number two distributor, driving through mobile, driving through broadband, driving through the pay-TV service. The DIRECTV penetration of HBO is an industry standard and getting better and better.\", \"To another data point, Dish in the second quarter, did a hard drop of HBO, and they said we're not going to carry HBO anymore. There's a dispute on pricing. They dropped HBO. One of the largest distributors of HBO drops them in the second quarter. HBO grew 3% in the second quarter, how? Power of distribution. And so, look, I mean you just put this all together and we are convinced, the old saying, content is king. I am an evangelical believer in that. But we also believe distribution matters. We've always been big believers in distribution and the power of it, and that's what we're trying to pull together.\", 'John Waldron', \"Talk about advertising, just as a component piece, because your history in AT&T has not been -- -- you're an advertiser not, right?\", 'Randall Stephenson', 'There’s a lot of them, right?', 'John Waldron', 'Just talk about the advertising model as part and parcel to broader AT&T platform?', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. So we have had a large -- not -- well, it’s -- we've had an advertising business by virtue of DIRECTV and our other TV platform for the last four or five years. And so we have advertising inventory within DIRECTV that we have been kind of, I would say, not entirely mechanized, it's a bit of a brute force approach to selling that advertising inventory. But because we have all of the viewership data from set top boxes, we have viewership data on the mobile phones we're getting an amazing premium for selling that small advertising inventory in DIRECTV. When we did though, the Time Warner deal, now WarnerMedia, what came with it was a rather large inventory of advertising by virtue of Turner Networks. So TBS and all the NBA, and TNT, and CNN. And then a huge digital inventory, CNN.com, Bleacher Report.\", \"And so, we have been investing in technology. And we’ve made a really terrific hire, a guy named Brian Lesser, who has come in. And we made an acquisition of AppNexus. And it's just basically mechanizing this approach we've been using in DIRECTV. And we spent the last year and a half standing up the technology stack to now take the Turner ad inventory, which is orders of magnitude bigger than what we've had before. And drive the same phenomenon using the very targeting data that we have from all the viewership information, all the mobile information and drive advertising revenues off the Turner inventory. We will be going to the upfronts next spring, one face, Xandr, and representing all of the Turner inventory, we will be doing that next spring and we're pretty excited about what the possibility is here for advertising.\", 'John Waldron', 'So you just promoted John Stankey, you mentioned John Stankey earlier, into a very important job in the firm. Just talk about John Stankey. Why John Stankey? Give us a little bit of perspective on him and what his background is and why…?', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Why John on this particular…?', 'John Waldron', 'No, why you chose him…?', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes, okay. Look, a year or plus ago, we had said we're going to go out and hire an executive to run what is now WarnerMedia. And we wanted somebody to run a very traditional legacy, let's call it, media company, a media company distributing to the old distribution channels, cable and TV. There are a lot of people, you could have gone out and gotten to run that play and to run that business. So there’s a lot of people that are equipped to do that. That's not what we were doing. When we acquired Time Warner, it was recognizing that the business was going to have to make a pivot and it changed. As I said, the viewership is growing, but it's not growing on traditional legacy kind of platforms, it's growing on digital platforms.\", \"And we had to reorient the business to drive towards digital, standing up the digital platform, digital production, digital distribution, it's a hard play. It's a hard play to take a legacy company. Believe me I know we've done this a few times. But take a legacy company on legacy distribution models and business models and make a pivot into a digital distribution model. And so as you think about somebody who could run that kind of play and literally take an organization and move it like that, it's not a big list of people that you would look at.\", \"John, I think has proven. He's taken the organization, broken down the silos very quickly, which is not easy to do. When you've had businesses that have been as successful and as productive as he's have for so long. He's done a really nice job of breaking down those silos and getting the business reoriented toward HBO Max digital distribution. If you're going to go find somebody to run a big communication company, John Stankey would have to be on your shortlist for that. I mean, he's got experiences that are long, wide and deep in the communications industry.\", \"Now, if you're going to go find somebody who can do both, right? Take a media company that has transitioned to a digital distribution company, and pairing it with the distribution of a major communication company, you want to try to bring these two closer and closer together and monetize the advertising revenues. All the sudden that list gets really, really short. And so the Board and I’ve spent a lot of time over, who do we want to have run this play for AT&T over the next couple of years, because that's where we are in the evolution of our strategy.\", \"We have moved now from a build timeframe. 2018 and '19 was all about building technology, all about standing up new capability and new products. 2020 is go-to-markets. Go-to-market, take HBO Max drive through your distribution channels, take the Turner inventory drive into the Xandr technology platform. So as we thought about who is going to run this play for the next couple of years, there was -- it was a very short list and John Stankey quickly rose to the top. And I've been asked a thousand times, is he the heir apparent? First of all, the Board hadn’t informed me I am retiring yet. So I could take offense to...\", 'John Waldron', 'I don’t know, afterwards you would okay.', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Look, I will say, if Stankey is successful at running his play over the next year or two… ', 'John Waldron', 'Well, he is well positioned.', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes, he's in a pretty good position if he executes his play…\", 'John Waldron', \"Yes. Okay, good. Let's talk about 2019 priorities and 2020.\", 'Randall Stephenson', 'Sure.', 'John Waldron', \"In terms of -- you've obviously set out a number of objectives to hit in '19 and obviously focus on '20. Just talk about how you're feeling about the '19 priorities and where -- how you would condition people for 2020, in whatever way you want to answer that?\", 'Randall Stephenson', 'So coming into 2019, John, we had a little analyst conference before the year began. And I told all of the analysts and anybody listening that I had one really, really high priority for 2019, and that was get the leverage down. And just -- it was distracting. It wasn’t something internally we were worried about, but a lot of our owners were looking at it and our credit holders were looking at it. We were issuing debt. We said we just need to drive the leverage down and we want to get it down to 2.5 times debt to EBITDA as we exited 2019. I did everything at the company to get focused on that. In fact, executive compensation, go read our proxy. My folks at my table are highly incentivized to drive leverage down to 2.5 times and everything about the business this year was to get there.', \"We said to get there you had to do two things, generate $26 billion of free cash flow, and so monetize $6 billion to $8 billion of assets. The $26 billion, we said at our earnings call that we're raising that target to $28 billion. We will do at least $28 billion of free cash flow this year. And I'd say check that box, we feel really good. We'll deliver on the free cash flow. The $6 billion to $8 billion of asset monetizations, we are year-to-date at $9 billion. So I'm feeling pretty confident we'll hit that one. We’re past the number. You guys are numeric people, you probably recognize, the probability of that's really high now. But -- so we're at $9 billion year-to-date. We still have a number of monetizations queued up between now and year-end. You'll be seeing announcements on these.\", \"And the team has done a phenomenal job at driving the debt down, driving asset monetizations and cash flow. It's just been a really encouraging and fun year from that regard. As we think about where we go from now, now that we see 2.5 times is achievable, and we will get there. I said last month, you should expect us to start to bring share buybacks into the mix. Now, one of the things in the Elliott letter that I thought was -- actually, I thought it was pretty thoughtful is, should you be more prescriptive about what your capital allocation strategy is as you go forward? But look, this year has been about one thing, 2.5 times. I don't want management distracted and I don't want our owners confused.\", \"And as we’re issuing debt, I don’t want to people confused that we're not driving to 2.5 times. But now that we're seeing that, I think the Elliott recommendation actually makes sense, all right? So we'll have some conversations about that in terms of how we get a little more prescriptive in terms of what our asset -- what our capital allocation will be going forward. So check the box though on delevering, we will get to the objective and I feel good about that.\", \"The other one we said we have to do is just get wireless back to good sustainable growth. And I honestly believe that this would be one of the variables that was most likely to move the share price as we came into this year. And because of the FirstNet deployment, FirstNet has gone off the charts, it's been as good as we could have ever hoped, that's building the network…\", 'John Waldron', 'Talk about FirstNet for a minute.', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. So I'll take a moment. If you're not familiar with it, there was a legislation passed by the government that said, United States Government, you need to put in place a process to have a network, a nationwide wireless network built for the first responder community. After 9/11, it was a disaster. The emergency responders couldn't communicate. Their systems didn’t interoperate. And so they said, build a network for the first responder community. We came into 2016 when that bid went out, and we said that's a must win for us. And I'll explain why it's a must win, because first of all, whoever won this bid, got 10 megahertz, which is a deep block of really rich wireless spectrum to use to build this network. And if the first responders weren’t using it, you could use it commercially. And that was a really, really big issue for us.\", \"We said, this is a must win for us in 2016. The Board and I spent a lot of time on this and said, we're going to go after this. We’re going to go after it to win. And we put a very fulsome bid in place. But here's what's going on. To build this nationwide network, which we began in earnest really aggressively in 2018, you have to go out and you have to climb every cell tower where you're deploying this network nationwide. Why is that such a big deal?\", \"We have also, over my 10-year as CEO, invested well over $40 billion at aggregating a big portfolio of wireless spectrum. And this is really important, because we believe when the world of video came and you’re distributing video over wireless networks, you're going to need an amazing amount of capacity. So we've been accumulating this wireless spectrum, $40 billion plus worth of this. So put that spectrum to work. What do you have to do? You have to go climb every cell tower and put it to work. This is an expensive stuff to do across an entire country.\", \"Add to that, we're deploying 5G. What do you have to do to deploy 5G? You have to go climb every cell tower in the country and put up 5G antennas, and the hardware associated with it. Well guess what? By virtue of FirstNet, spectrum aggregation, 5G, we're climbing these cell towers one time and accomplishing three purposes. So we've been doing this and we're literally, over the course of about three years, are increasing the entire nationwide capacity of the AT&T wireless network by 50%. And I just don't know -- I've been doing this almost 38 years, John. Those words have never come out of my mouth to just back quickly, just boost capacity in a nationwide network by 50%. What's the byproduct to that?\", \"AT&T in the last year and first half of this year has just surpassed the competition in terms of wireless network performance. It is unequivocally the fastest wireless network and best quality network. We've exceeded the competition and the gap is widening. It’s not getting closer. That's a beautiful place to be for a company like ours, having a high quality network claim. And it's really important when you're entering a world of distributing premium video to our consumers over wireless networks.\", \"And so you put all this together, the wireless business got back to a nice growth profile in the first and second quarter. And we’re having nice growth. We’re having margin expansion. And we see this continuing. It's a beautiful platform for Internet of things. We will, as a result of all this work that I just talked about, we will have a nationwide 5G footprint by midyear next year, nationwide 5G by midyear next year in the really premium spectrum areas of our network. And so we're feeling really good about wireless. So as you think about the priorities; the balance sheet was number one; wireless getting into growth, number two. You see the stock moving as the wireless performance continues to move. We had a third priority, and that was our entertainment group, which is our broadband and our TV business.\", \"And last year, look, the margins were really compressing. And the business was down on an EBITDA basis, 15% virtually all year. We said coming into this year, we're going to get that thing stable. That was one of the areas people questioned the most whether we could achieve it, or achieving it? It was up 7% in the first quarter. 3%, I think roughly in the second quarter. Third quarter is going to be a little tougher, because NFL SUNDAY TICKET comes and you got to start recognizing that cost. It gets a little harder to get to growth. But I will tell you for the year, we’re feeling highly confident, check that box, feel good about that. The other priority of standing up HBO Max, we're way down the path, October 29. Again, you'll see what the product looks like. We will be launching it next year. WarnerMedia is still continuing to execute well. Revenue is up 5% in the second quarter, nice operating income growth.\", \"And then the last priority was network, which I talked about. So what we’ve told the team and what we’ve told the owners this year is as we go through 2019, don't check most of the boxes, don't hit most of your objectives, hit every single objective. And so far we're hitting everyone and as it stands right now, I'll be really surprised if we don't hit them all for 2019.\", 'John Waldron', \"That’s great, that’s great. Let's talk about mobility. There's been a fair bit of change in and around mobility and industry structure. Maybe most of it is kind of apparent at this point, and maybe there is more or maybe not. What's your perspective on where the industry is going? How you’re positioned? Do you see a lot more change in the structure of industry? How would you articulate that?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. So the industry is kind of in a interesting place right now. You have two of the competitors trying to combine and it's an interesting time for business right now looking at M&A. You do a vertical merger like AT&T and Time Warner. Government challenges it, and you go through extensive lawsuits and then you do a horizontal merger, Sprint and T-Mobile trying to come together. And the federal regulators say they're good with it, wave it through. But you see something we've never seen before. I'm not -- I can't remember it ever happening. State AG is getting together and filing a lawsuit to block it.\", \"And so it's hard to predict what the industry structure is going to look like. There are a lot of areas where it would make sense for industry consolidation to occur. We don't intend to participate in any of that as you might guess. There are a lot of areas where it might make sense, but the uncertainty in terms of how it's going to be treated by regulators makes it really hard to predict where the industry goes.\", \"The wireless industry, over the last year, I think some of it may be distraction and so forth. But it's been somewhat stable and it's something that’s widely competitive. There is a new promotion every day. But by enlarge it's been stable as we've seen it for quite some period of time, and people are working to put their unique value proposition together. You know what ours is, it’s premium, premium network of premium, premium content and that's our approach to the market. And everybody is talking a little different approach. Everybody is in an aggressive build cycle for 5G. So a lot of capital being deployed as well. But do we have a new player in the market in the form of Dish with a prepaid business and a lot of fallow spectrum? Does that coming into the market? And the AGs have a successful lawsuit and block it? And I honestly don't know how to predict it.\", \"I do think of the next two or three years, doesn't get radically different. If the Sprint T-Mobile deal gets done, everybody is -- Sprint T-Mobile, we know what that play looks like to run integrations of large scale networks. They have a lot of great opportunity. They'll have a lot of spectrum to put to work. But it's a two or three year integration exercise. Dish will have a rather significant period of time to build out network. So next two to three years maybe as predictable as they have been. As soon as you say that, something will change. But it's kind of my assessment of it right now.\", 'John Waldron', \"You mentioned 5G. 5G is a -- to our mind at Goldman Sachs has enormous -- an enormous impact to the economy more broadly, and not just to the wireless business and the telecom industry. What's your perspective on 5G? What -- how should we think as investors or as participant, how should we think about the impact it can have, and how are you positioned? So talk a little bit about it, just expand on it?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. 5G when -- it's interesting, when you talk to even sophisticated investors and so forth, and you ask what does 5G mean? And people talk “Well, the networks are faster.” Well, it's more than faster protocol. It is faster. And it's very low latency. Meaning the timeframe between initiating a command and actually executing and being visible to a consumer, or actually executing a command if you're in a manufacturing floor, those could be almost real time. We're talking about real time networking. And so it's faster. But what that -- what 5G facilitates goes so much beyond that.\", \"And there are a couple of areas that are worth, or noteworthy in my opinion. And the first is you're moving into an era of connectivity, like we haven't conceived of before. This isn't just marginally better. Like when you went to LTE, 20%, 40% faster, so this is different scale. Because in a world of 4G, you can put on a cell tower in a given square mile area, thousands of simultaneous devices. This, this, your car, thousands could be simultaneously connected to these networks.\", \"When you go to 5G, what changes is that becomes millions. Millions of simultaneous connections are now feasible within a given square mile area on this technology. That's a different business proposition for everybody who sits in this room and all the companies you invest in. So the connectivity goes to a different level. The security, this is the part we love, goes to a different level as well. You can in 4G, because you're using basically GPS technology, locate a device like this or this, or a car or whatever, within meters. In the world of 5G, you begin to locate devices within a couple of centimeters. You're measuring in centimeters.\", \"Now think about this, from a security standpoint, somebody in banking, who might have a card with say a large scale equipment manufacturer like Apple. But what that could mean to you in terms of security, being able to locate an individual within centimeters or a particular area, being able to set up geo-fencing in a particular area. And you can only access our data if you're in that particular area measured within centimeters. That's a big game changer as well. And then the part that brings all of this together is what the speed of this network will accomplish? Does it allow us to virtualize a lot of our functions, what do I mean by that?\", \"A lot of the capability therein all these devices, whether it's this or whether it's just a sensor or a connected device, the form factors and the size are a function of what you have to have in here, power. You have to have compute capability. All of a sudden, when you have networks this fast, you can begin to push a lot of these requirements, storage into the edge of the network. And so you're getting cloud distributed down to the edge of the network. This brings a whole different level of speed, but it also brings a whole different level of imagination in terms of what your form factor starts to look like.\", \"Millions of devices per square mile, literally being located within centimeters of each other with a whole different form factor in terms of power, storage and compute requirements. I mean, truly the Google vision of a few years ago that everybody laughed about that this becomes a screen, that's feasible, that is truly feasible. Sensors that are microscopic, because the power requirements are so much lower and where this allows you to go as a society. I mean, traffic management capability, because of sensors that are this cheap and broadly distributed millions per square mile, pipeline management, utility. I can go on and on. Autonomous cars, what it facilitates is a whole different level of thinking.\", \"And I have to remind people, if it goes here then think about how much of our country's infrastructure, day-to-day business activity is underpinned by this kind of technology. Then ask yourself, is it rational that the United States Government has a concern about who might be supplying that kind of infrastructure. And so you kind of try to wrap a ribbon around why all this makes sense and what you're seeing play out in the media and the press today, but it's an exciting time. Now where is AT&T in this regard?\", \"We feel really good about where we are. You need a really good cell grid to be relevant here, check that box. You need a nice portfolio of wireless airway licenses, spectrum. Check that box plus the spectrum that gives you this really hyper speed. We call it millimeter wave, but it’s a spectrum, it’s in a whole different stratosphere. We've been very aggressive. We have a really large block of that spectrum that we've acquired, either through government auction or we acquired a company that gave us a really robust block of the spectrum. So check that box, the ability to deploy the technology, thank you FirstNet. Check that box. The antennas are going up on the cell sites today. And you have the balance sheet to deploy the capital required to do this? Check that box. So as I said earlier, midyear next year, we will have a nationwide footprint of 5G and I'm pretty excited about it.\", 'John Waldron', \"Do you have a view, just incidentally, on 5G in the U.S. versus 5G outside U.S. in terms of where -- how fast the U.S. is moving competitively to deploy the technology capability versus what we're seeing in other parts of the world?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. I hear a lot of hyperventilating about the Chinese leaving us behind and the U.S. is being left behind. Look, I'll tell you, you have T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon all going aggressively, accumulating the spectrum required to deploy this, getting the spectrum cleared and the right bands to deploy this and working the standards of the technology. And so we have been aggressive. AT&T was hyper aggressive at working the global standards for 5G so that our network equipment providers can manufacture equipment and get us in the market.\", \"We are live commercially on the highest grade 5G standards based technology, and I think we're in 21 markets right now, Mike, I'm just -- you're shaking your head, in 21? And that number will move up as we go through the course of this year. In China, I'm not aware of any live 5G systems up and running. The Europeans, I don't even know that anybody has an RFP out yet, to be quite honest with you.\", \"So right now as it stands, the United States is leading. But look, it's a legitimate issue. The U.S. must lead in this area. We led in 4G, we led in 3G. What was a byproduct of that? Silicon Valley went nuts with mobility and because of what the U.S. did, Silicon Valley created an amazing amount of value by developing product and capability. 5G, I think will take this to a whole different level. It's not going to be a lot of little consumer apps, these are going to be big business apps, the apps that kind of -- applications that change how society works, how manufacturing is done, the U.S. must lead in this. And that's when John Donovan, who -- you asked about the organization earlier, he retired, he is retiring next month actually. He has led our technology organization for many years.\", \"And it's worthy of just taking a pause and reflecting on what's been done. Because John Donovan and his team drove virtualization technology as we talked about. Moving the technology in these networks, 5G particularly to what I'll call cloud based technology, for one of a better term and virtualizing it. This is a big deal, because when you virtualize these functions and then you create operating systems that manage them and you put those operating systems in the open source community, that's what we've been leading, that's what John Donovan and his team have been leading.\", \"You now inoculate yourself, from a Chinese competitor or a Chinese manufacturer, who may try to dominate the global supply chain. You have now taken technological approaches for how you address the Chinese threat to 5G. And so leading the world in this virtualization has been huge, not only has it been huge in kind of making sure that we have a technological solution to address the Chinese situation, but what is done to our cost takeout has been stunning. It’s worth a diversion, because the biggest cost in an operator like AT&T, the biggest cost we have is the cost to run a network, cost to run an IT shop, the cost to run all of the technological shop. That's our biggest element in our P&L.\", \"This virtualization, which we now have 75% of our network virtualized, cloud based types of architecture. We are now 17 -- roughly 17 quarters where the cost of this has been going down year-over-year 7% to 8%, year-over-year for about 17 straight quarters, that's a stunning development, for a company like ours to get yourself in a cost position like that to address pricing pressure, competition from the Chinese and so forth, it's a really powerful thing. And so just give John Donovan a shout out as he's retiring. I think the global telecom community owes him a thank you for what he has led here.\", 'John Waldron', \"Terrific. You talked a bit about the video piece of your infrastructure. But I want to get your perspective on video, the profitability in video and programming costs. Because one of the things that, as an observer of this industry for a lot of years, the programming cost issue, just the inflation in that element continues apace. What's your perspective on that?\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes, it's -- everybody bemoans cord cutting. And it's -- obviously, it's a phenomenon that is going rampant and it's not going to change. The industry -- it is a -- it's kind of its own corporate in this regard. Because programming costs -- particularly we talked about retrans costs, taking major networks and selling over-the-air type content into the cable systems and satellite system on a re-transmitted basis, those costs are just ballooning. And they're buying all kinds of sporting rights and so forth. And so those costs are exploding. And as a result, the cost of the average multichannel cable or satellite bill just continues to grow.\", \"Coming into this year, we said look if we're going to get this business stabilized we're going to have to make some really hard choices, as it relates to the programming costs. And we had a number of deals coming up for renewal. And we said, look, we're not -- it can't be business as usual. We can't just go out and sign these kind of price escalators and think you’re going to somehow create an environment where at a price point the consumer will stay in and a price point where you can be profitable in these businesses over the long haul.\", \"So we made some hard choices. We had a couple of folks drop this year, CBS, Nexstar, dropped us because we couldn't come to terms, in terms of what the pricing mechanism look like. Those were painful few weeks. I think John Stephens, my CFO spoke last week. So we lost as many as, I think 300,000 subs, because we had to take those drops. But look, it was the right thing to do. And we landed in a place that I think rational and reasonable for both the content providers, as well as us as a distributor of the content. But you're going to see these things kind of play out.\", \"And it's going to change how we think about these multichannel kind of offerings. And as retrans takes more and more of the money in this type of area, it’s going to put more and more pressure on what I'll call the fringe content. And the ability to continue to carrying fringe content in these packages and so forth. So the bundles probably gets skinnier as the retrans rights take more and more of the money. But that's just the reality of it. That's probably where we're headed.\", 'John Waldron', \"Let's talk a bit about the world, as we're wrapping up here. You are an astute observer of the U.S. economy. You have a sense of the global economy. Just maybe just give us your perspective on what you're seeing out there from an economic standpoint? Then I want to shift a little bit to the China dynamic.\", 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. So let China aside for just a moment, which is hard to do. Look, we came into this year and I thought this is going to be an unbelievable year, from just an economic expansion standpoint. Everything was queued up. Consumer confidence was really, really high. Business investments, which look, as I try to do correlations between what's good for AT&T and what are the economic indicators most relevant, business investment is the number one indicator I watch. I watch it like a hawk. It is probably the biggest predictor of economic growth and ultimately, customer attitudes than any other indicator. And for our business, it correlates with our business revenue streams, I mean, almost 1:1.\", \"And so coming into this year that was looking good. We've been on a number of quarters of sequentially the business investment of 6%, 7%, 8%, which is huge from our standpoint. We get into 2019 and that business investment thing starts doing one of these, and that's just a little bit of a yellow flashing light. I mean, not red flashing light, but yellow flashing light. And you start trying to get your head around what is going on. This is where you can't leave China out of this conversation, because whether it's China, or whether it's USMC, the Mexico trade agreement. I mean, it's just U.S. business is so dependent upon exports and trade. And when you have your two biggest trading partners kind of frozen between the NAFTA rewrite and China trade, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that business investment starts slowing down. And that's exactly what we're seeing.\", \"And I'm really hopeful that as we get into election season, there may be more motivation to get something done on these. Congress get the USMC voted out, let's get that trade deal done with Mexico and China brings some stability to this, because right now -- I try not to talk us into a recession. I don't think we're headed to a recession, but we're definitely slowing down. And you can't have that kind of slowdown in business investment and not find its way into the consumer ultimately.\", 'John Waldron', 'Do you have any further comment on the China situation, just in terms of its broad impact or your concern vis-à-vis the relationship between these two critically important economies and countries?', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. It's easy to be critical of the President in this. I got to tell you, fundamentally, I don't disagree with what he's trying to accomplish. It has been asymmetric. It has been asymmetric in a lot of ways. And not just in trade and tariffs and so forth, but just asymmetric in terms of technology, intellectual property, the licensing requirements of intellectual property, I mean it's not a secret that you can lose some of your intellectual properties protection when you bring it into China. And so getting aggressive on that, I actually applaud the administration for their approach and how they're thinking about that and processing. I don't think that's wrongheaded at all. It's painful, going to get through it. You'd like to see us find a path to kind of get something done.\", \"I also think that the administration's approach on 5G -- the Entity List through the Commerce Department and so forth, I don't think it's wrongheaded. Look, there was a day when the United States, if we dictated a technology path, it dictated for the rest of the world. But when you have 1.4 billion people in China and the kind of scale that we see in China, the U.S. can no longer dictate technology paths. And it's a different world. We're operating in a different environment. And so I think what the administration is doing, trying to ensure that we shore up western supply chains from the security standpoint as it relates to 5G, it's important, it's really important. It's fair to critique the approach and so forth. But in terms of the motivation, I think the motivations are right.\", 'John Waldron', 'What do you see as the biggest risk out there, just in terms of what could take the economy down? Is it just sentiment? What do you worry most about?', 'Randall Stephenson', 'What could take it down, what could slow the economy down, because I…', 'John Waldron', 'Slow it down…', 'Randall Stephenson', \"Yes. What are the things that can slow down, the things that are slowing it down right now; Number one, trade, all right, these trade issues are a burden on the economy; and there's another one that -- we're getting into the political season. And I think it's hard for somebody to argue that the Tax Reform Act that recently was enacted in '17, as it relates to corporate. I don't want to talk about the personal side, that's a whole different issue. But getting the U.S. corporate tax structure competitive with the rest of the globe, you would be hard pressed to argue that that has been anything, but really positive through the entire U.S. economy at large. And I don't mean, just the high-end of the spectrum of income earners.\", \"We are seeing, as a result of fixed investment being up, as we talked about, unemployment being at crazy low levels. And unemployment is at crazy low levels across all demographics. I mean, the African American unemployment rate is -- I mean, we ought to be doing high 5s. The Latino unemployment rate, it's at an incredibly low levels. Put on that, we're seeing for the first time in 15 years, productivity gains. As to see the kind of productivity gains we have seen for the first time in that long is nothing but a function of stimulated capital investment as a result of tax reform. And when you see productivity gains, coming into an election cycle, we all ought to recognize only by virtue of productivity gains, are we seeing for the first time in ages wage gains.\", \"And by the way, wage gains at the low end of the scale are higher than wage gains at the high end of the scale. These are good things. These are really great things for America. And I just hope that as we get into the campaign season, we will be thoughtful as we think about restructuring corporate taxation to recognize that there has been a lot of good and a lot of productivity that goes up and down the demographic and economic scale of the United States public. And I’d just -- that's one thing that as you think about the next two years, can we undo a lot of the benefits that have come as a result of what transpired in 2017?\", 'John Waldron', 'Randall, I really appreciate your time. Thank you for coming this morning. Good luck to you.', 'Randall Stephenson', 'Good talking to you, John. Thanks so much.', 'John Waldron', 'Thanks, appreciate it.'], ['Butler National Corp.

Mr. Stewart?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Thank you, Mr. Drewitz. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate you taking the time to dial up the phone and listen about Butler National. We have had an exciting quarter and as you can tell by looking at your 10-Q and the press release that revenue was up basically $3.5 million over quarter one of 2018 and were up $2.3 million from the quarter ended April 30.', 'So, our revenue and our income are following each other and we’ve had a successful quarter in actually two or three year in a row. Get nervous about that sometimes but they are coming along pretty well. Let’s start out by looking at the press release and you can all see that we did $17 million versus $15 million than in the previous quarter and $13 million the year ago. ', 'Our operating income was $3.5 million versus 740 – versus 900 a year ago and 746 and you notice our long-term obligations went from $3.765 million in April, $44.207 million in July and I would call your attention I will talk about it in a minute Footnote number 11 in the 10-Q tells you we have to adopt the new accounting provisions for capital leases and all kinds of leases. ', 'And so, you got to be aware that most of the numbers in here are distorted because of that adopting that information. So, we will cover those as we go forward. As you can see here, we spent $397,000 on R&D this quarter, compared to a year ago $318,000 and compared to the quarter ending in April $655,000. So we are continuing to invest in the R&D to keep the product line fresh.', 'On Page 2 of the press release you basically see that the Aerospace products increased 63% and Professional Services up 2%. We think that’s pretty good 2% increase in Professional Services basically in an agricultural and oil-based economy out there that is a little bit uncertain under the current policies with China and the agriculture situation. ', 'Our net income as we talked is $2.1 million, compared to $509,000 and our operating margin went from 6.7% to 20%. So, basically you are see in the Aerospace once you cover that fixed cost minimum the money goes to the bottom-line real quick. There is considerable material cost, but basically it’s labor and once you cover the overheads you are in good shape. ', 'Also, pointing out on the third paragraph on Page 2 of the press release, the $397,000 in project developments. You can look at all those numbers on the Professional Services and like I say, they are distorted by Footnote 11. ', 'Although they are very good and like I say, the 2% increase in revenue is not distorted. And the Aerospace down below has got a 63% increase in revenue and that’s distorted by one hangar lease, which is not as nearly significant as the lease in Professional Services. ', 'So our operating income from Aerospace increased from $357,000 to $2.3 million from previous year. We were pretty pleased with that. We think that’s good progress. Like our backlog is hanging in there at roughly $16 million, $16.7 million as of July 31 this year, $13.4 million at July 31 a year ago. ', 'And we had $16.160 at April 30, that’s up $534,000 from that and the shipments of $17 million. So, that’s sales I should say, it’s not shipments, it’s total revenue. ', 'And we see that as positive. We don’t see anything that’s really changing very much at this point. I have Aric here. If you had questions about Aerospace, sales, later on we can talk about those if we need to. ', 'I think now we should look at the 10-Q itself and you’ll notice we have some cash on board there and we also have some major capital investment coming up about $7 million trying to be in a position where we can do that. Those investments had to do with a couple million between $2 million and $3 million at Boot Hill to rework the electrical systems. ', 'So we don’t have brownouts at – when we had storms or somebody cuts the power lines between us and Garden City or somewhere else. We’ve had all those occurrences that cost about [$100] [ph] to $50,000 an occurrence. ', 'So we’ve got to spend some money to fix that. Avcon, we need to increase fab job that’s $1 million plus job and here in Olathe we are doing about $2.5 million of capital investment relative to BAI and we are doing some capital investment in Arizona. So, we are looking at $6.5 million, $7 million to be spent on capital investments in the next year or two. ', 'As far as the balance sheet goes, I would – you will see a new item under property plant and equipment called finance, lease, right to use, forty three million six hundred and eighty. That is not the purchase of the land and building. That is the accounting change. [It does] [ph] a present value of theoretically of what we are leasing. ', 'So that it’s fairly representative of what it would look like if we actually bought the thing, but it’s a distortion because of the accelerated depreciation, plus the interest cost is greater than the lease cost. That will go on halfway through it and then it will turn around and we’ll get the money to have more income that should have. So, anyway, that you just need to study that if it’s bothering you. It’s not really bothering us. We just want to make sure no one is concerned. ', 'Under current liabilities, you notice there is a $1,070,000 of current maturities, finance lease liability, which is a calculation per the SEC requirements. Compute that number. We also have a long-term lease probability down below $42,000,384, both of those are covered in Footnote 11. ', 'If we go over to the next page, which is revenue, that’s summary revenue in expense you’ve got cost to Professional Services and – it’s distorted by that big long-term lease and its valuation, so is depreciation and amortization. And of course, there is $1,097,000 of interest expense that is really paid as part of the lease payment. ', 'So, there is some distortion there. If you look at Footnote 11 and the Q, you will see that the total distortion is about $510,000 decrease in overall net income. So, I think that’s important. I think we are glad we finally got that thing put into the numbers. We didn’t necessarily agree that is what we ought to be doing, but we don’t set the rules. We just do the accounting. ', 'So, that’s where it is and we got it approved by our auditor and everything is wonderful. That’s filed on Footnote 11. It’s ASU 2016-02 Leases Topic 842 if anyone wants to following up on it. And I think that goes as far as financial information, we are really happy that we are moving in the direction we are moving. ', 'If there is questions on extension of the lease, and the buyout of the lease and the answer is, or extension of the contract and the buyout of the lease, the answer is, the extension of the contract seems to be moving. It’s moved slow for the last 2.5 years, but maybe we’ll get something to happen in the next month or two. I keep saying that to you and you don’t believe me, but that’s fact we are actually moving a little bit. ', 'Financing of the buyout seems to not be a major problem at this point. Thanks callers and we want to know where we stand on it fairly regular basis. So it’s a good thing. I didn’t say that they are going to loan us any money. ', 'That is just their interest. So, with that, I think, that’s probably the big question in everyone’s mind and I appreciate your patience. And I think it’s time for us to take calls unless somebody else here in this room has any comments. I don’t see any. ', 'Craig is in Arizona going to flight safety. So, if you have any comments you want to make over time here? ', 'Craig Stewart', 'No, I think you covered it.', 'Clark Stewart', 'All right. Thank you. David, we are ready for questions.

Please state your question. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Good morning, Clark, folks. Clark, it’s always been kind of a concern and we talk about it some on as option program. Is there any proved definition as to how that’s going to be allocated over timeframe and price and what the criteria is? ', 'It seems like it’s out there and I think it creates uncertainty on the stock price a little bit as to how that’s going to operate and so forth. Is there a definite plan that you have formulated yet or not? ', 'Clark Stewart', 'No, we probably will discuss that at our next Board Meeting which is coming up here in October and try to get that done. Right now, we’ve been trying to figure out how we make money and get all those. You realize that our backlog is increasing faster than our increase in revenue. ', 'So, that’s the reason we got to spend a little money here and there to try to get to the point where we can produce more products. But that is – that’s not been on the list until we get to the October Meeting, Tim. So, I can’t…', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay, well, as I say, I think once you can address that and give real clarity, it’s going to help the price of the stock. It certainly – it raises questions and hopefully you can get that handled. Also, on your – you’ve mentioned this - that about the – you are thinking the extension is looking better. Can you say what makes you say that? Are people – is everyone trying to get extension along with you or are we the only ones? ', 'Clark Stewart', 'We really don’t know what the other people are doing on it. We just know that we are trying to get the lottery to talk to us and deal with us on the basis that we really want to move forward and we are five years away from the end of the contract and that kind of doesn’t put a high priority on it except by us. And so we continue to pressure them and try to meet with them and we do meet with them and that’s why I’m saying, we – that’s about what I can tell you it is that we’re – we think we are moving forward. ', 'We are not moving backward let’s say that a week ago if you’d asked me I just said we are moving backwards. This week, I think we are moving forward. I couldn’t tell you about next week. So it’s a political situation from the standpoint of what the state really does and how they do it. What policy they are establishing as they do it and I guess my answer to you is it’s still in a pretty good state of flux. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. All right. Very good. Well, thank you, Clark. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'Thank you, Tim, for the questions. ', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sam Rebotsky. Please state your question.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Yes. Good morning, Clark and Craig. The backlog is $17 million. Last year, we did $32 million in sales and we are increasing. Can we keep increasing the backlog and is this backlog is profitable as the current quarter’s portion?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Okay. That’s a good question, Sam. I would answer that, but I think the backlog is about the same mix as the last quarter. I don’t see a difference in the backlog there. I think it’s a matter of how the cycle of getting this. We got airplanes that range from $0.5 million to $3 million or $4 million modifications when they show up, that’s a timing issue. ', 'We are shipping gun control units at Arizona and that’s a pretty steady flow. That backlog runs for couple years out there. So, the answer to your question is, yes, we are working the backlog on a regular basis and we see that it’s – profitability seems to be pretty stable in that group, if you agree with that Aric. I am looking at Aric Peters here and he is saying, yes, that’s a good statement. So, the answer to it Sam is, yes. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Now the fact that we did $17 million in sales and the backlog is $17 million, when do we expect to complete the backlog? Is it three months? Is it six months?', 'Clark Stewart', 'I’d say, the backlog as it sits right now, of course, it has new additions coming all the time. We will ship that $17 million over the next 18 months. What we don’t know the answer to is how much more orders keep coming in as we ship out the $17 million. So that’s in – yes, the answer is we are covered for at least 18 months, I’d say. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'And as far as the number of bids we have out there, is that, could you quantify the dollar amount of bids that we have on the new work that we are bidding on?', 'Clark Stewart', 'I couldn’t – I don’t have a good list of it. My guess is it’s in excess of $17 million. Probably close to $20 million. What we used to say is we have a book laying here with all these quotes in it. It’s worth five years of business. Now which one of these quotes is going to come in next week, we don’t have any idea. So that’s a tough question to answer because we do a lot of this stuff is quoted couple of years ahead of time. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. And the…', 'Clark Stewart', '$50 million in quotes out there. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', '$60 million in quotes?', 'Clark Stewart', '50.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Six zero?', 'Clark Stewart', 'No, five zero. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Five zero. $50 million, five zero? Okay.', 'Clark Stewart', 'That is correct.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. Yes, we purchased the aircraft, is it – it’s on the books, the new aircraft that we purchased? Is that’s on the books now?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Yes, that’s correct. It’s on the books. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. And so, were you surprised that the profitability [in the current] [ph] quarter?', 'Clark Stewart', 'A little bit. We forget about the fact that once we cover all those fixed costs, it all comes to bottom-line. We really don’t think about it that way is as we price this stuff, we build in that, the overhead associated with it and so we kind of lose track of the fact that contribution comes in. So, the answer is, yes, quite honestly we are little surprised. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'And I know you’ve been trying to buy stock and the window has been closed, when does it open up?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Craig, that’s your question. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'That window is open right now until the end of second quarter which is October 31. So we can buy stock anytime now – between now and October 31. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'And I mean, it’s nice that the price has moved up and it moved up on the earnings on your announcements and the activity increased, whether or not these are short-term or long-term buyers. Do you expect to tell the story a little more to get more people involved or what are we doing there?', 'Craig Stewart', 'I think we’ve still got the big story that everybody wants to hear is the story about it getting the extension and casino and aerospace split apart into two separate entities. I think we need to get closer to that happen before we go put a push on we found and we’ve done it based on earnings that it’s all temporary and we need something that will be more long-term. ', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Right. Well, hope you keep doing what you are doing if you could sort of replicate the profit of this quarter, I think you are just getting more attention. Good luck guys. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'Thank you. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'Thanks. Sam.', 'Craig Stewart', 'We appreciate the questions. ', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tony [Indiscernible]. Please state your question. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Good morning guys. I guess, just a question for Craig. I’ve noticed that since the inception of the stock buyback program, we’ve picked up, we, the company have picked up about two and a quarter million shares and I’ve also noticed that’s because of some footnotes, it says that, every single one of those transactions has been a private transaction. ', 'In other words, we the company have get to go into the open market to purchase any shares. Can you give us a little bit of color as far as where these two and a quarter million shares came from? Are they coming out of in a state? ', 'Or are they coming out of just an inactive shareholder? We certainly don’t need names, telephone numbers and so forth and so on, but just some sort of guidance as to who out there has two million or three million shares that they are anxious to sell?', 'Craig Stewart', 'These, the shares in general are coming for people that are contacting us. And it’s number, it’s not – most of them not been big chunks of – there hadn’t been anybody selling 0.5 million or 1 million shares. There has been a few that are close to 100,000 shares here and there. But most of them are people that are contacting us and, Sam, they would be interested in selling their shares. ', 'We did buy – we had been out in the markets. It’s been a while since we’ve been out in the open market. That was pretty slow and painful of buying 500 or 1000 shares at a time and there were lot of days that what’s the rules that go around that we couldn’t even buy any shares for a number of days somewhere out there that, actually most of the days that we are out there, we didn’t buy any shares. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Right. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'So…', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'That do you think if the reason that people are contacting you to see if the company has an interest, let’s say in buying 50,000 or 100,000 or whatever, it is just because of the relative illiquidity of the stock and the fact that they’ve realized that if they slam in the market for a 100k that they are going to adversely affect the company. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'I think that’s pretty accurate. I think rather than try to do it – and I think people realize too that if they try to sell 100,000 shares with the way the stock typically trades…', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Right.', 'Craig Stewart', 'To do that they either going to take you quite a while to do it and keep the price up or you are going to depress the price and not get as much of it. So, yes, I think it makes sense for – in those situations for people to contact us.', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. All right. All right. Are you in contact with a particular market maker or various market makers such that if they see a piece of stock during an open window situation that they would contact you, in other words, if – I’d just make this up. If night trading is shown a quarter of a million shares, do they know to give you or whomever in the company a call and say, I am being shown a block, do you care?', 'Craig Stewart', 'I know that that there is one market maker that would do that that we view as and been in contact with. I don’t know that a majority of the market makers would do that. ', 'I think much part of the market makers will try to transact those on the open market and that may be in fact that may be a real good idea to reach out to the market makers that are showing on the list there and let them know that if they get something that we’ve be interested. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'If they shown size, just give you a quick call?', 'Craig Stewart', 'Yes. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Sure. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'Now that’s great idea. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. Thank you guys. ', 'Craig Stewart', 'Thanks, Tony. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'Thank you, Tony. ', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dan [Indiscernible] Please state your question. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Hi, nice quarter. Based on the backlog that you’ve stated and the expected capital spending, what are we looking at from a cash flow position at the end of the day over the next couple years? You’ve made very nice healthy cash flows that at least $2 million or $3 million on average over the last several years. Is that $10 million number going to grow and the debt go down over time here?', 'Clark Stewart', 'The $10 million I would say, will go down as we make these investments and I think that’s true. We also had some people perching us to loan us some money to do some of this building expansion and we haven’t really analyzed that. We are really more concerned about figuring out how to get buildings taking care of on these airports where we have federal restrictions on the land for the military and we got a lot of questions to be answered before we can really move forward. ', 'We’ve negotiated lease here and New Century which is the old Naval Air Station in Olathe and it’s taken about two-and-a-half years to get all with everybody to sign that off and get it taken care of. So, that takes a while. The answer is, we are saving that some of that cash, so we don’t have to borrow so much land to do these things. ', 'So the answer is, the cash probably won’t grow a great deal more from where it is now and then have to put cash on hand and of course, we are on the casino it takes a couple million bucks all the time to $2 million to $3 million needs to be out there. So, that’s kind of the overall picture of it as I see it. Tad, do you have anything different on that?', 'Tad McMahon', 'I don’t see that – that’s my answer to the question is, probably, it’s going to go down, Dan. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. Over the next year or two, but then I would assume that your business plan is that cash grows over five years or is this the long-term cycle to spend?', 'Clark Stewart', 'You have to remember, our business plan we are looking at a new casino in Guymon, Oklahoma,125 miles. That city out there in the flat lands of the west where distance is not a real problem. We don’t analyze that that’s a 5% hit or 10% hit or what there is maybe 20%. And so we are pretty sure that’s going to be a challenge to maintain that revenue out of that city and the profitability out of that segment. ', 'From the airplane standpoint, as we all know, we are operating in a cycle where we had probably in 2005 and 2006, the airplane market right now, which is there is any problems with like Iran and these other places. We are going to have go back on some of the non-military sales that we have and those are significant. We are selling STC hits which are essentially packaging parts and high dollar paper. ', 'So, that will all stop. But I guess, what I would tell you is that, we are trying to maintain the activity we’ve had as we’ve done at the last year or so. But I’ve been telling you there is some possibilities if that won’t be able to take place as we’ve done. ', 'So, although we are working to do it that, like I say, we do have lot of orders out there and a lot of things coming about. So, that’s not a very good answer for you. But that’s really the facts. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. So we are looking at a 5% to 20% hit possibly on the professional service line over the next few years. Is that accurate?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Yes, it will happen in the next two years. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. And on…', 'Clark Stewart', 'When they start up, they are stronger in the first two or three years. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. And then, the aerospace, have we created a new baseline with our STCs and our R&D spending and stuff or can that drop by $10 million in a year also? Or are we really making more money over the long-term on that side? ', 'Clark Stewart', 'We are making more money over the long-term, clearly. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay.', 'Clark Stewart', 'We’d make the product innovation that’s caused that margin to go up substantially. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. Would it be fair to say the company would think it’s more urgent now than before to pursue the spin-off and the reverse stock split which also makes the cost of purchasing stock lower and cheaper for us buyers, because you have to buy fewer shares and to facilitate a better, more seamless management of both of the divisions?', 'Clark Stewart', 'I guess, the answer is that, we are proceeding basically as we have done than we think that we are moving forward with a good plan in both areas. I believe that there is no one causing anymore – more pressure on the extension of the contract and the spin out than we are. You can’t see it that we definitely spend lot of time every day on that topic. So, that is high on the list and it will stay there until we get it accomplished. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. Is the Board going to be merciful?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Pardon?', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'All right. Finally, is the Board going to be merciful in its decisions based on the restricted stock issuances to the shareholders you actually have to pay for voting rights and the stock price?', 'Clark Stewart', 'I am not in control with the Board. That’s going to be their decision. And… ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. Well, nice job for the quarter. Thank you very much. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'The compensation committee will deal with that issue. That’s what overall – like I say, I don’t – I am not the one running the Board, so. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. Thank you. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'You bet. Thank you. ', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dennis [Indiscernible] Please state your question. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Yes, my question is, the cost of professional services was $5.3 million from the fourth quarter, but only $3.8 million in the first quarter. So, can you help me understand the reason for the decrease? And whether that decrease will continue into the second quarter?', 'Clark Stewart', 'Just a minute. Our CFO is going to answer that question. That’s a technical question. ', 'Tad McMahon ', 'Well, I think you mainly have to look back at Clark said on the Footnote 11. Some of that decrease is the rent went away and it’s been reclassified into interest and depreciation. ', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. The depreciation and amortization increased from $0.6 million in the fourth quarter to $1.2 million in the first quarter. So, that’s like a $600,000 increase versus the decrease in professional services was $1.5 million. So that’s quite a bit of a difference between that. ', 'Tad McMahon ', 'The depreciation is – when you depreciate the $42 million that was capitalized in as lease, depreciation went up accordingly and the rent expense is no longer classified as rent expense and that’s $1.2 million. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'You can see on Page 10 of the 10-Q, Footnote 7, summary down there is this increased depreciation, $693,000 increase in interest expense $1.35 million, decrease in rent $1.218 million and that increase in expenses of $510,000. ', 'Tad McMahon ', 'So that change in accounting principle is – had an earnings hit of $500,000 this quarter that will continue throughout the year. So you extrapolate that, it’s about a $2 million hit on earnings for the one year?', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'Okay. I guess, the fact that I didn’t work out was the increased interest expense. So, if I look at that, then I’ll understand why cost of services went down so much. ', 'Clark Stewart', 'I believe that doesn’t turnaround till 2024. That will continue to see there.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) Goldman Sachs 28th Annual Communacopia Conference Call September 17, 2019 10:30 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Mike Sievert - President and COO', 'Braxton Carter - CFO', 'Neville Ray - CTO', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs', \"All right, welcome, everybody. We are going to go ahead and get started here with our next session. And it's always a lot of fun to welcome back to Communacopia the team of T-Mobile. We have Mike Sievert, the President and COO; Braxton Carter, Chief Financial Officer; and Neville Ray, CTO. Guys, welcome back to Communacopia.\", 'Braxton Carter', \"It's a pleasure to be here, Brett.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Brett Feldman', \"All right. Mike, I'll start with you with the obvious. You've received federal approvals for your merger with Sprint. So, congratulations, although you are obviously still contending with the states who are looking to block the deal through a lawsuit. Is there any update that you can give at this point in terms of your engagement with the states? Is there a potential route to a settlement or do you ultimately expect this to be resolved in the court?\", 'Mike Sievert', \"Brett, we’re very confident that the deal will close about three months ago. So, yes, we're in kind of uncharted territory. We worked really hard this year to bring about the federal approvals. We're very pleased with that. We think our story, we've been saying since last April, resonated very strongly. Of course, both the FCC commitments that we made and the DoJ settlement with the consent decree required changes in our plan. But as we very clearly indicated in the Q2 call, the changes that they represented were changes that allowed our business plan, our aspirations and every dollar of our synergies to remain intact.\", \"And so, it took a long time to get that done because we were very steadfast in making sure because we believed so deeply in this plan and that it's right for consumers and right for the public that we needed to -- there were certain core principles out of it that we needed to hold to, to make sure that not only were those good things preserved for the public, but that our business would be intact. And we're very, very pleased with how all that worked out. In the meantime, group of state attorneys general sued the deal and now we're facing that. And, of course, that's an ongoing litigation. We can't get into much detail on that.\", \"I'll tell you that we feel very strongly about our case. This is something that from the first day that John and Marcelo launched this deal at the end of April of last year, we've been very confident that this is positive for the economy that it’s positive for consumers, creates more competition, not less, brings down prices, makes us a better competitor to an entrenched duopoly of AT&T and Verizon.\", \"It’s good for jobs with net positive jobs at day one and every day thereafter. And that ultimately that's going to be seen by the public and by the decision makers in this case, either the attorneys general themselves or ultimately, if we go to trial on December 9th by the judge -- and it's a strong case, and we’ll let the merits of it speak for themselves. But beyond that since its litigation, I can’t give you too much color on all the ongoing details.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"All right. So let’s just follow up on it from a different angle here. In order to secure that federal approval, you did make a number of concessions, the most significant, you're ultimately going to be divesting Sprint's prepaid business, you'll be divesting the 800 megahertz spectrum to DISH. And you're also going to be supporting DISH's entry into the wireless market via a seven-year MVNO deal. So, the obvious question is. What made you comfortable that the merger still improves your ability to compete and win share and lean 5G while also enabling what could be a potentially disruptive new entrant in the form of DISH?\", 'Mike Sievert', \"Yes. I'll start and then Braxton maybe you can give your perspective. As I said, we had some core principles that were really important to us, and it took us a long time because we stuck to those principles. We wanted to be able to come out and be able to share with you that our synergies were intact and our business plan was intact.\", \"And remember, the vast majority of the synergies in this deal come from the network side. $26 billion of the $43 billion comes from not burdening the American consumer to pay for the fully redundant costs of two networks that sit right outside each other, but rather to bring those together into one larger network that's much more cost efficient and with a multiplicative capacity relative to the two standalones. That's where the majority of the synergies are. That plan is only being enhanced as time goes on and we are able to plan for the more detail than we had expected to be able to plan for it in advance of the close.\", \"Look, DISH is going to come in. They are going to be a viable competitor. On the other hand, there are opportunities for us in that competition. One, we're a provider to them. We made sure that the arrangement we have with DISH simultaneously accomplishes our goals and theirs. We can monetize the arrangement in a way that's attractive for our shareholders through the MVNO deal, but at the same time, we enable them to get going.\", \"We've never been a company that's shrunk from competition. We love competition. We thrive on it. We think competition plays to our strengths because we're a net share taker, and we're very confident in our business plan going forward with DISH in it as a viable competitor.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"And Braxton, as Mike just noted, you didn't have to reduce your view of synergies despite the concessions. The network side of it's fairly clear. What about the rest? How were you able to identify the same upside to the Company even with the concessions you made?\", 'Braxton Carter', \"Yes. First, I will say that we certainly have enabled with these agreements another competitor in the marketplace. That doesn't bother us in the least, Brett. You look what we’ve done for the last seven years. We’ve defined competition in this space. And we are more than happy to facilitate Charlie, and I would never bet against Charlie Ergen. I mean that guy is brilliant. He’s done an amazing job, building a company over the years, and he’s parlaying it into an entry into wireless, and he certainly has the wherewithal to do so.\", \"But to get to your basic question, first of all with the MVNO arrangement, we're losing the revenue and the margin associated with the prepared business of Sprint. But we're replacing it with a wholesale arrangement and not to go into specific details that is largely an offset, certainly different type of characterization. But when you look at the overall economics of the new T-Mobile, it was fairly neutral. Let’s leave it at that.\", \"Secondly, the disposition of the spectrum, that's a delayed deal that 800 megahertz is being utilized by Sprint and we cannot dispose of that, until we got to the point where we've migrated all the customers off the Sprint network and shut that network down. Delayed sale, significant proceeds coming into the Company, but not significant proceeds upfront, you've also seen that with the sale of the prepaid business.\", \"We've reduced the all overall amount of our bridge commitment associated with the deal. We've taken it from $30 billion down to $27 billion. Two factors, the proceeds from the sale of the prepaid and the significant over performance of T-Mobile over the last year-and-a-half allowed us to do that. We're hopeful we can still get this deal closed this year. But if we do in fact go to litigation, this deal will not close until early 2020.\", 'And when you look at the underlying foundation of the synergies, nothing that we agreed to in these dispositions really changed here. Remember two-thirds of the synergies are coming from shutting down that duplicate network. And the other third is really coming from back office, duplicate advertising, duplicate G&A, et cetera that has really nothing to do with the dispositions that have been agreed to. That coupled with how well we’ve done at T-Mobile throughout the pendency of this deal, we’ve not missed a beat. Quarter after quarter, we’ve continued to execute on the Un-carrier.', 'What Neville’s doing with the network has just been truly amazing. You saw at the second quarter, we took up our guidance on cash CapEx to the very high end of the range. I mean, he is going full blast in inuring amazing benefit to our Company. And that coupled with the brand momentum on what we’ve done from a marketing standpoint, our innovative customer service, we’re very happy with the trajectory that we’re seeing and very happy with what we’re seeing in the third quarter too.', 'Brett Feldman', 'So, Neville, let’s talk about the network a little bit. A key reason for the merger is that by uniting your low-band spectrum with Sprint’s mid-band spectrum, the new T-Mobile is going to be in a position to really aggressively challenge AT&T and Verizon in the 5G market. What are the key ways that you believe new T-Mobile is going to have a 5G network advantage? And how quickly can you factor that into your go-to-market strategy after you close the deal?', 'Neville Ray', 'Yes, a bunch in there, Brett. So, I mean, I think to build on Mike and Braxton’s points, we’ve been running at an incredible clip, building out a 600 megahertz spectrum that we paid a lot of money for and we really wanted to get into the market and into the hands of our consumers. And that’s the base layer of 5G service for T-Mobile and for the new T-Mobile. So, making progress on that this year has been incredibly important. We cover more than half of the U.S. population with our spectrum today, and we’re building as we continue on through the balance of this year.', 'The beautiful thing in the deal is, we have that big broad geographic layer of 5G in place. We add to it this mid-band depth of 2.5 gigahertz spectrum from Sprint. And we will add on top of that millimeter wave, we call it a layer cake, it kind of looks like a wedding cake, big low-band, mid-band, and then millimeter wave on top.', 'The fun thing for us is that we’re already deploying 600. We’ve done -- and Braxton, Mike and John have authorized me to do some work at risk this year in getting ourselves ready to deploy the 2.5 gigahertz spectrum as soon as the deal closes. Nobody is more impatient for this thing to close than me. I wish I was deploying 2.5 radio on the network right now, but we’ve done work at low-cost in terms of securing, permitting, and authorization to deploy 2.5. So as soon as this deal closes, we’re in a position where we can start laying down 2.5 radio on the new T-Mobile network.', 'So, why is that important? Well, one, that allows us to commence and move Sprint customers off of the redundant assets on to the new T-Mobile. That then is the path for us to decommissioning the redundant sites and generating the synergies that have burnt the hole in my head. $4 billion run rate on synergies from the network side is a phenomenal opportunity.', 'But -- so, the latter part of your question, what does that allow us to do from a competition perspective? I mean, I see us -- we’ve caught up with Verizon and AT&T, right? We have 326 million people covered with LTE. Our geographic coverage is effectively the same thing. So, we’ve caught up. We are right there with those guys, and we continue to make sure we stay in that position.', 'What happens now? When we go into that post-close environment, we can start to very rapidly lay down 2.5 gig spectrum and start to deliver a very transformative 5G experience, more sites, more sites, a lot more spectrum, and spectral efficiency of 5G. And the combining effect of those three factors allows us to lay down the network that moves from 30 megabits per second today to 400 megabits per second, a transformative increase in speed and capacity, 8x over the term of the program for capacity, 15x for speed. I want to do that as fast as humanly possible.', \"I caught up with AT&T and Verizon. Our intention is, we move ahead of them incredibly quickly, and we start that move ahead in 2020 and it accelerates in 2021. So, this business has been heavily reliant on network brand, the network perception for so long. We still have our work to do on perception. But our opportunity, now we've leveled the playing field with those guys on LTE, is in this 5G era with the spectrum assets we have, to rapidly move ahead of AT&T and Verizon.\", \"And I want those guys to be chasing my network and my team and our execution. And it's going to be very, very difficult for them to do with the spectrum assets they have in their hands to-date to compete with our experience on the network, which is very high speed, and very strong capacity. I’ll stop there and we will come back with some other thoughts in a while.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"I want to take a step back. Mike, we just talked about bringing the networks together. Once the companies are together whether it's later this year or early next year, how quickly is the new T-Mobile going to become relevant to consumers? I'm a wireless consumer. In the first hundred days or whatever the right metric is, when am I going to see from the new T-Mobile?\", 'Mike Sievert', \"If you think about what Neville just said which is the ability to not just be on par with AT&T and Verizon but to leapfrog them in capability, at the very moment that every American consumers taking a look at the industry again because 5G is causing reconsideration. That's fantastic. That's great timing, but it's a fantastic opportunity for us. Because if you think about it, with all the tens of millions of customers that we have, let's be honest.\", 'Most of those customers came to us because they saw something at T-Mobile that they loved in the Un-carrier value proposition. And in the back of their heads, they were wondering, to the perception issue that Neville just presented, they were wondering if they were trading something off to get that great Un-carrier value proposition.', 'And yes, here we are with all the success, even with consumers wondering in their head, am I making a trade off of some sort on the network? What happens when for the first time in this industry one brand can present consumers with both? You can do business with the Company that will give you the best value, treat you right, put you first with a customer centric strategy and have the best network, demonstrably the best.', \"And at the very moment, everyone's reassessing because 5G is causing you to ask and answer the question. That's a fantastic opportunity for us. So, we can't wait. We have to move really quickly. We're going to unify the go-to-market approach. We're going to have creative and interesting value propositions. We’ve had the time because of the pendency of this deal, as I joked earlier, has taken longer.\", \"But that's allowed us to write the software and get it in the market that allows us to close this deal quickly after it’s approved, and then launch a unified value proposition across all of the Sprint and T-Mobile existing customer bases and distribution, relatively quickly. And I think that's very important that we move quickly. I love the fact that our 5G strategy assumes mobility.\", \"Everybody keeps asking, well, where's 5G going? What's the business opportunity? Are you going to get into IoT, or is that what 5G is? Is it driverless cars in it? Yes, it's all that stuff. But make sure you don't discount the 300 million consumers in this country with smartphones. That's where the money is and it’s where the money is going to be for years to come, and when we brought 4G out, nobody really knew exactly what the innovations would be.\", \"We really thought it would be like a webpage on a mobile browser, loading faster, but instead, it transformed our economy and created massive companies. And the kids in garages making tomorrow's Uber, the 5G version of Uber, here is the question. What set of technologies are they going to assume for their innovations?\", 'Are they going to assume a Verizon like technology, which is ultra-fast wideband connections in some areas, parts of Manhattan and Sacramento and loop of Chicago and other areas as they try to build out, or are developers going to assume a technology that has a nationwide average of over 400 megabits per second, low-latency, high-capacity? Are they going to assume mobility in their innovations? Of course they are.', \"And so, to us, we love this hand of cards, because what makes wireless different from traditional Internet is its mobility, and we are going to bring transformational 5G experiences like consumers have never seen to every part of our network in every part of this country, and we are going to do it incredibly quickly. And it's a real source of strength relative to our competitors.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Let's talk a little bit more about your outlook for 5G adoption because we know what your roadmap is for deploying a 5G network. It's going to come very fast. You alluded to the 4G cycle and you are right. There are a lot of things we never saw coming with 4G, but the carriers definitely thought it was a big deal. You all subsidized devices, you were going to get a little more ARPU as a result of it. So, there is a bit of a push from the carriers, and it was a fairly fast adoption cycle for consumers. A common question we get is when are consumers going to want 5G? What's your view? What do you see out there that's going to incentivize the consumer who want to go from your 4G service to your 5G service?\", 'Mike Sievert', \"Yes. Any of us can talk about that. I can start on it, which is one thing that we’ve seen in the history of the Internet is that up to a certain level, we don't know exactly where that level is for wireless. Up to a certain level, consumers have an insatiable demand for speed and capacity. Don't bet against speed and capacity in a mobile context. We're nowhere near where it's fast enough for consumers.\", \"Now, there is an interesting question that says, when you have a nationwide average of 400 megabits per second as we will have, all across this country, and another provider has some isolated areas with a gigabit. Will that matter to consumers? Will it really matter to them? I'd argue that that's a fascinating question.\", \"But and the difference between today's 30, which all three providers generally provide, and 400, customers will have an insatiable demand for that capacity, and innovators in garages and from big companies are going to make sure they do because the innovations will demand and soak up that capacity. That's something we've seen all throughout the 20-year journey of the Internet, and don't bet against that over the next five years, in mobility.\", 'In the out years, there is fascinating questions about driverless cars and drones and augmented reality and IoT and plenty of enterprise networks slicing and plenty of interesting opportunities. Are we making investments in those areas? Absolutely. Do we think our spectrum assets give us a differentiated ability to compete in those areas? Yes, we do. But remember, the dollars today are with the tens of millions of people with smartphones and successors to smartphones.', \"Mobility, technology you carry on your body as you roam about the world, you want breakthrough speed and capacity for that mobile technology on your person, and T-Mobile will be uniquely positioned to provide it. AT&T is duly pursuing a strategy that looks similar to standalone T-Mobile. They're going to put a base layer out there. Verizon is pursuing millimeter wave. Only the new T-Mobile is going to have both breadth and depth to provide these kinds of transformational experience to everywhere people go, and developers will develop to that solution.\", 'Neville Ray', 'And if I could just pile on here, because this may sound like it’s this T-Mobile strategy thing, right? And Verizon and AT&T, how could they be doing something different? The irony is, if you go outside of the U.S. and you look at where 5G is being rolled out in a formative fashion, it kind of mirrors exactly what we’re doing. So, the best example I can give you right now is South Korea, a mid-band 3.5 gig strategy, they rolled out their services in early April, first couple of months was bumpy because they were still building, but almost in the same number of months, there are almost now 3 million 5G users, smartphone users on that network in South Korea.', 'They’ve got something close to 50,000 mid-band sites built out across the three operators. That’s a three-player market, by the way, very successful one. The usage, I saw numbers last week in a bunch of data that’s now public, coming out from South Korean government, capacity consumption in the mid-30 gigabyte per month range. So, from kind of sub-10, 2.5, 3.5x, not uncommon, and it’s all in consumers.', 'So, what’s happening? More video consumption, right, existing use cases become really great use cases in 5G. To Mike’s point, people can use their smartphones in all places, less Wi-Fi. So, they don’t have to trade off their great mobile experience in 5G now. They are doing way less Wi-Fi. And then, what’s emerging which is super exciting is some limited VR, but the augmented reality space and there’s a lot of great things happening in South Korea really starting to bring kind of new and exciting use cases to smartphones.', 'Though it’s early, they’ve only been active for, what, a couple of quarters, but it’s one of the best cases we’ve seen in 5G rollout that’s formative and meaningful. And where is it growing, where’s the money coming in? It’s in consumer. The Chinese market is about to pop. So, October 1st, National Day, we’re going to see, I don’t know how many sites, I hear everything from 50 to a 100,000 sites are going to turn up in mid-band across the three operators, 50 cities. They’re already preceding the market place with 5G terminals.', 'And so, over the next two, three months, we’re going to see something pretty powerful emerge in the Chinese marketplace on 5G in consumer smartphones. And so, it’s not like we’re the crazy guys who are doing something maniacally different from everybody else. The rest of the world is doing something different from Verizon especially, stuck on the millimeter wave island and different from AT&T. And it all comes down to the spectral assets that you have in our hands and the position that we are in with the new T-Mobile is a unique one in the U.S. with low, mid and high-band, and affords us the opportunity we’re so excited about.', 'And to Mike’s point, the timing is incredibly good for us, when you think about consumer adoption and interest in 5G is starting to start. We know we didn’t get a 5G iPhone this year, right? We can all hope and pray that there’ll be one next year, but 5G smartphones are going to go mainstreams as we move into 2020. So, that’s another great compounding opportunity for us to leverage and look at within the T-Mobile.', 'Brett Feldman', 'So, Braxton, you’re the money guy. It sounds like the Company is looking to build a premium 5G network, a premium 5G experience. Verizon’s already said that they intend to, at some point, charge a $10 premium for 5G, but you said 5G isn’t going to cost any extra. Why not? And if it’s not an ARPU story, how is it a revenue story for T-Mobile?', 'Braxton Carter', \"Yes. I think, first and foremost, the underlying business case is a massive increase in capacity. And when you look at the combined assets of Sprint and T-Mobile and the new T-Mobile, we are differentiated. And, I love the terminology that Mike use, we're going to leapfrog the network experience here in the United States for consumers and really be the testbed for all the innovation that’s going to develop, and we want that to be western-based and not the eastern-based.\", \"When it comes to the economics, we have a treasure trove of spectrum with this new T-Mobile. And we have a site density that is unparalleled by flexing once we have the Sprint network shut down, embedding those owned assets, creating a very dense network core here in the U.S. And you’ve seen the stab, 8x increase in the overall capacity of the business, a 15 times increase in the speed that's being offered over what can be done on a standalone basis with the assets that we hold today.\", \"The key here is we are economically incented to utilize and fulfill that capacity. We're the number three player in the market. We're the challenger. We don't have the scale. When you look at the margin differential between AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile, it’s all scale. I guarantee you we're more efficient than both companies.\", \"And by utilizing and filling that capacity with the ARPU assumptions that we have embedded in our case, which isn't monetizing, you create much more terminal value and shareholder appreciation by continuing to scale this business. And that's really the whole business case for the value creation, which is substantial with the new T-Mobile. So, we're very, very excited about it.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Okay. We’ve spent a lot of time talking about 5G, but we're still in the 4G cycle and your 4G business is actually showing continued growth. Your second quarter results had record low postpaid churn and you saw accelerating service revenue growth. And I believe it was your 25th consecutive quarter of adding at least 1 million net adds to the business, but when we're looking at the competitive backdrop here, some investors have started to question whether it's going to get harder. Verizon lowered price, you tweaked your race a little bit on a couple of plans, Altice is bringing in $20 unlimited plan. So, the question is. What's been driving the momentum in your business? And do you think it's sustainable in light of some of these changes that we're starting to see unfold slowly in the market?\", 'Braxton Carter', \"I'll be happy to start. Verizon didn't drop their price. So, they’re the first to tell you there's going to be no impact on ARPU. It's marketing. I think, first and foremost, if you look at the last three quarters, we've had lower churn than AT&T. When you look at postpaid as a category, we had lower churn than Verizon, last quarter. That tells you something about what we've done here. We've closed the gap on our network versus the duopoly.\", \"And on top of that, we've applied extremely innovative marketing. And believe me we have more of it coming in our back pockets. This created amazing brand affiliation with our customers and the momentum of this business is incredible. And you couple that with very innovative customer service. Our NPS is off the charts. There's so much momentum with the Un-carrier right now.\", \"And that's again what gets us really excited on new T-Mobile is the ability to leapfrog them from a network standpoint, where there is no way that they're going to be able to effectively compete the way they've competed for last two decades. Very, very excited about the future, and we're very pleased with the momentum that we’ve created over the last seven years under John's leadership with the Un-carrier, and that momentum is powerful.\", 'Mike Sievert', \"Can I say too, how proud we all are of our team for executing the way they are during the pendency of this deal? We've posted a number of just blockbuster quarters. I mean, Q2 was just a phenomenal demonstration of what our team can do and how differentiated the service they provide our customers really is. And at the end of the day, customers want to do business with a company that puts them first, that treats them right, that changes the rules of the industry in their favor.\", \"And the Un-carrier, to Braxton's point, it's become a phenomenon, and customers value it. And they're interested in what it is we can do for them. And we're just getting started. We have the highest -- as Braxton said the highest net promoter scores right now in the history of the wireless industry. The only thing that's not great about that is the wireless industry isn't famous for high net promoter score.\", \"Our brand has the opportunity to take on brand fame compared to any company in America and when we keep executing on this strategy that we've been executing on. I think, in many respects, we're just getting started, when we enter an era where we can not only continue to invest in this differentiated experience. When you walk into a T-Mobile store, it feels different than our competition, the people feel different.\", \"When you call us up and you don't get a robot and you get right to a person that's dedicated to you and a 40-person team that's incented to make you happy in our Team of Experts care strategy, it feels different to do business with T-Mobile than with our competitors, and really we're just getting started on all that.\", \"When we can simultaneously offer a demonstrably superior network experience, while continuing to invest to make that customer experience better and better while our costs fall because of the merger and we're able to invest in value for our customers, because of those following costs and rapidly rising capacity, there is massive potential to be excited about how we can translate that into consumer value. And the way it turns into revenues is they keep coming to us from AT&T and Verizon, as simple as that.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'It certainly sounds like that momentum has continued. Can give us any insight into the third quarter so far?', 'Braxton Carter', \"We're very happy.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"All right, I’ll take it. Neville, I do want to go back to buildout question. It's quite clear that if the merger goes through, you're going to have a spectrum advantage. We've written about this in every category, you stand head and shoulders above your peers. Another key element of deploying a 5G network is fiber. And we have heard from different parts of the industry that deploying fiber at a local level has started to hit some challenges. I was wondering if you can give us any insight into whether this is becoming a real impediment and does it any create a risk that you may have difficulty hitting some of these 5G network milestones you've agreed to.\", 'Neville Ray', \"Yes. I mean, again, this comes down to kind of the deployment that you're pursuing, Brett, right? And for us, the answer is not an issue. So, I mean, we're effectively -- we lease our fiber. And that's well more than 90% of our network. We actually do some fiber equivalent microwave for a small percentage where it's tough to get fiber. But we’ve had very few issues. We've actually contracted for the 5G era for the new T-Mobile with the lion’s share of our providers, the folks that are willing to step up to the pricing arrangements we want to see. We've already neck deep in that.\", \"So, we're not just taking care of the LTE network today, but we’ve been recontracting our business for the future that comes. And so, why is that story a little different from us? Well, our story on 80,000 plus cell sites, that’s a macro site deployment strategy. So, we have to get and make sure we’ve got gangbuster fiber to those locations. I'm not talking about building out hundreds of thousands of small cells for millimeter wave, the only fiber. I think, the Verizon stat was they’re going to pass.\", 'I don’t they’re going to do it or not, is this mythical, fictional? I don’t know. But 30 million homes, it was one of their stats with millimeter wave. I don’t know how you do that. It would take years and years to get the physical infrastructure in place, let alone the fiber assets that you need. You’re probably going to end up doing some form of wireless backhaul, instead of fiber, if that’s the density of deployment that you’re going to go after.', 'But every engineer in the room is going to tell you, if you’ve got depth of mid-band and low-band whereby you can stay on a macro-cell deployment, with 80,000 sites and not 380,000 sites, one is way, way more economically efficient than the other. And our strategy is a macro strategy. That’s how we’re going to go lay down the 400, 500 megabit per second network. We’re actually seeing those speeds in South Korea, ironically, on a mid-band on a 3.5 gig network already with a macro-based deployment. So, that’s the difference for us.', 'I am very, very comfortable with our 5G strategy. The areas where it sometimes can get difficult, is when we’re going into growing rural America where big part of the new T-Mobile plan is to actually make sure we have a kickass 5G network across the U.S. everywhere, including rural America. And we’ve been driving fiber into many communities in rural America for many, many months, if not years.', 'And the beautiful thing is, we go in, we contract, we put seven-year deals down for folks to run fiber into rural communities. And you know what that fiber comes in and the schools use it, the library can use it. I mean, we’ve been -- folks have criticized us, it drives me nuts, Brett, on this saying, you can never get fiber into rural. You absolutely can, if you put money down, and you’ve got a business case and a network proposition that supports it.', \"And so, not only are we bringing wireless, there are rural communities across the U.S. today that are benefiting with fiber deployment in their communities on the back of our wireless deployment. So, I'm very, very bullish in this environment.\", 'If I was sitting there staring at 300,000 small cells with millimeter wave, I might have a lot more concerns because that’s a tough nut to go crack. And quite frankly, I don’t know how they’re going to go do it. But that’s their problem, different strategy. I think, as soon as they can land some mid-band, that strategy will publicly change to something, which is more rational and aligned with what the rest of the world is doing.', 'Brett Feldman', 'Let’s talk about mid-band because there is presumably going to be mid-band licenses that could be commercially available next year, whether it’s CBRS process, we have some dates on that, whether to C-band process, you have some opinions on that.', 'Neville Ray', 'Yes.', 'Brett Feldman', 'I was hoping you can maybe give us your view on what the right policy should be for the FCC in terms of bringing mid-band market?', 'Neville Ray', 'Well, always more spectrum is good, right, never seen a megahertz we don’t like, right? So, can’t comment on millimeter wave right now because we are in an auction. So, we’re in a quiet period for millimeter wave auction that kicks up in December. But as you say, I mean, next year -- so, that auction, that millimeter wave auction substantially going to spill well into few Q1, somewhere in there, maybe Q2. There is a CBRS auction now being scheduled for kind of mid-year.', 'And CBRS, just to refresh everybody, there’s about 70 megahertz, 35 plus 35 of licensed spectrum is going to be auctioned. So, it’s not a lot. The Korean market I was talking about, and most places, it’s 3 times a 100 that’s being put into market. So, this is a small volume of spectrum. And I believe, if my facts are correct, you can only buy 40 megahertz of the 70 megahertz, as a single company.', \"So, that's something. It's got power limitations, it's got sharing requirements. You have to turn down the service on the coast when naval radar comes in proximity to the service. So, it does have some complications. It's not a great band, let me say, to build a network on. Opportunistic spectrum on top of your existing network, it has potential. And we're trialing and testing, and of course we're looking with interest at any of those bands.\", \"C-band is the next one, Brett. And, I mean, that's got to come after CBRS. So, maybe that can happen in late next year, maybe. I think, we'll hear something from the FCC, as we exit 2019 around, where they see this opportunity firming up and emerging. Obviously, we've been a strong proponent on as much spectrum should come to market as possible.\", \"There have been competing models around private sale, which I think is filled with difficulties and very, very problematic for the government, as well as the industry. But we'll see something, and maybe it's late 2020, maybe it's ‘21. But it's not -- it's going to take some time for that spectrum to become -- a band plan to be finalized, for radio to be manufactured, for handsets and all those pieces. So, there's several years before that becomes a formative mid-band opportunity.\", \"So that's, again, why we love the new T-Mobile opportunity. It's our opportunity to leapfrog, to get out in front, and deliver in the U.S. marketplace a true compelling 5G experience. That is not going to happen with the strategies from our competitors today, not going to happen in the timeframes. And we like to say, I think, one of the speakers earlier on said, we have a U.S. leadership position.\", \"We really don't. I mean, what's happening in South Korea and is about to happen in China is of a scale, we need to seriously worry about our competitive position on the global map with 5G. New T-Mobile can do a lot of goodness to accelerate and get us back in the game and making sure that developers and the industry and ecosystem becomes really strong and vibrant here in the U.S. marketplace. And we don't have to wait for two to three years for that to come about. That's something we should all be concerned about.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Braxton, earlier you talked about the incentives to fill the capacity in the new network and that example was to go for market share. On your second quarter call, you also said another version of that incentive is to support MVNOs. How do you think about what type of MVNOs make an effective partner for T-Mobile, particularly the new T-Mobile? And do you think that there's an opportunity here to have a broader relationship with cable companies?\", 'Braxton Carter', \"Well, I think, first of all, we have, with the new T-Mobile, existing relationship with a cable company, Altice, that we very much embrace and have agreed to with the federal agencies that will do good faith negotiations in a commercially reasonable manner to facilitate that on the T-Mobile network and we're happy to do that. We do commit to do that.\", \"I think you hit it right on the head. Wholesale is a very, very high-margin, low-cost strategy that utilizes capacity on your network to the extent that you have available capacity. And, we very, very much embrace that. It's part of our existing business model, and certainly will be part of the business model for the new T-Mobile going forward.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"I want to talk a bit about margins. And putting aside the merger putting aside synergies, we’ve already seen T-Mobile gross margins. A lot of that has come from improved network operating expenses. You have been growing your services revenue faster than you have been growing your network operating expenses. You've seen some improvement in SG&A, but that's still an area where you are spending the considerable amount of money. So, if you just think about the path forward on the current P&L, what is the algorithm for growing margins in the business as it is?\", 'Braxton Carter', \"So, I think one of the ways that I would look at this is, we are a massive growth company in an industry that really doesn't have growth. And it’s an acquisition-based model that it is expensive to grow. So, when you look at scaling of SG&A -- G&A, we are scaling. But selling part of the equation, you're not seeing as much scale as you would if we were the established incumbent that was just generally maintaining market share. And look at the amount of market share that we’ve taken in on growth over the last seven years.\", \"Our margins would explode if we moderated the growth in the business. That's not where we are at. That's not the path to the creation of long-term terminal value and shareholder appreciation. And while our margins from an SG&A standpoint are not greatly expanding, you're seeing some scale. I mean, you look at last quarter versus the prior quarter, we saw some improvement. The offset to true creation of value is cash generation and you look at the cash generation in the way that that’s ramping with the existing T-Mobile standalone.\", \"Ultimately that's the only thing that's going to drive long-term value. And that is a reinforcement of the point that we're creating more value by scaling the business, eventually that massive lift will come as you unlock that scale and your growth moderates in the future, but we’ve got many, many, many more years of runway, the enterprise opportunity, the geographical expansion, new business cases and models that will come out of 5G. This will be a growth story from many, many, many years to come. And with that, there is the trade-off. You're not really generating the margin.\", \"The other aspect that you've seen, and we’ve put it into our guidance the last two years, and you will see it again when we provide guidance for next year, is the investments of the network, you build it and it will come. There’s only been four times in the history of wireless where anybody reported the level of churn that we reported last quarter. The investments of the network are absolutely critical. And we are right now at a pivot point of investing in 5G, laying that platform.\", \"And what that's doing is driving more network OpEx because we have to touch all those sites and put up new radio. Neville has been brilliant. He’s humble but he’s been brilliant. He drove the industry to dual-band radios. So, we're out there touching these sites rolling out 600 megahertz. He did it with hardware that's fully 5G compatible and drove the development of those radios with our network provider ecosystem, Nokia, Siemens and Ericsson. Very, very, very efficient build versus having to touch it twice, but that's generating more OpEx.\", 'And you saw massive scale happening from a network standpoint in some earlier years of T-Mobile. What you’re seeing now is still network scale, but not as much, given the investment cycle we’re in with 5G. But the dividends that it pays from an overall modeling standpoint, the amazing progress that we’ve made in churn, the amazing scale that we’ve been able to achieve over the last seven years is well worth the price.', 'So, the message is, you want us to be a growth company. You want that trade-off for the time being. And in the future when -- and its many years down the road, when we are the scaled incumbent, then we’ll put a huge dividend in and play the game that way.', 'Brett Feldman', 'That’s a great place to end it. Thanks for being here, guys.', 'Braxton Carter', 'Very, very much appreciate it.'], ['Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Healthcare Conference Call September 18, 2019  4:45 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'David Meline - EVP & CFO', 'Arvind Sood - VP, Investor Relations', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Graham Parry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch', 'David Meline', \"[Abrupt Start] Company, we’ve seen good execution as we started 2019 as we drive volume-driven growth around the world in increasingly dynamic healthcare environment, managing a diverse portfolio, we have representation in six therapeutic areas that we're investing in and are commercializing.\", \"Recently announced the acquisition of Otezla to supplement our inflammation portfolio, which I'll talk about. We've also recently in July launched our first two biosimilars in the U.S. adding to the effort that we've already launched last year in Europe, continue to drive investment in R&D with a rising level of investment there and some exciting opportunities developing in the pipeline, working with the U.S. administration advocating for patient access, for affordability, and for the continued support of a healthy healthcare sector, and then finally driving towards continued long-term growth for the company.\", \"We've been going through a portfolio transition of the business where we're now facing competition for some of our legacy products, and we see in the first half of the year that's impacted our revenue with $11.4 billion of revenue in the first half with decline of 2% on a year-over-year basis, and our non-GAAP EPS has increased nonetheless by 3% year-over-year.\", 'If you look at the products that are experiencing nice growth for the company, quite a lengthy list, so starting with Prolia in the bone franchise, which was recently supplemented with our second launch in bone of EVENITY. Repatha is our entry in the PCSK9 area, and we’re experiencing 50% plus growth again this year from that product.', \"So we have very strong confidence in the growth of the product, Aimovig, our CGRP migraine product, first launch for us in that space, Parsabiv a Calcimimetic IV administered, we have a portfolio of six growth products in the oncology areas listed here, which are now annualizing at over $5 billion. And then finally, our biosimilar effort, where we've been working over several years on 10 biosimilars, of which three have now been approved and launched.\", 'Turning to the recent acquisition activity, we announced an agreement with Celgene to acquire the worldwide rights for Otezla, acquisition price gross was $13.4 billion and which we estimate on a net basis after tax benefits will be $11.2 billion. This is obviously an important addition to complement our long standing expertise in the inflammation area, it will give us some nice growth going forward as well as enhance and continue to help us to build out our presence globally.', 'And I think importantly for us given the strong balance sheet position of the company and strong cash flow generation in beyond this acquisition, we continue to expect to have plenty of financial flexibility to continue to look at other opportunities. If we you look at the pipeline highlighting several attractive opportunities for the company, first in oncology, our KRAS G12C small molecule inhibitor which is gaining a lot of attention and moving very quickly through the clinic, we have a platform of BiTE molecules, where we have a high level of conviction. The first of those of course, we launched BLINCYTO which is doing very well, and we have a number of other developments in this space of BiTEs. ', 'We also have, I would highlight a couple of Phase 3 trials underway, the first for tezepelumab, which is an antibody for asthma, in inflammation, and then Omecamtiv mecarbil in the cardiovascular area for heart failure. In terms of upcoming milestones in the clinical and regulatory space with our KRAS inhibitor, we’ll be giving an update in late September here in a couple of weeks at the ESMO Congress.', \"We expect also some additional pipeline data in 2019, including for our CD33 half-life extended BiTE as well as our EGFR BiTEs. We expect in 2020 to see our Phase 3 readout on tezepelumab with data. We have our Lp(a) program AMG 890 where we expect to launch our next phase of development in the first half of next year. In the biosimilar area, ABP 710 which is a biosimilar for Infliximab, we have an action date, a BsUFA date in the U.S. in December of this year. And then finally, our biosimilar Rituximab, we've completed now the Phase 3 trial.\", \"So, if you look at the total portfolio of biosimilars that we've been working on, 10 molecules which last year, the innovative sales of these molecules was some $68 billion. We've now launched three of those. And then we have several others that are in late phase trials, so we’ve submitted for approval, I think there's a good opportunity for this portfolio for the company.\", 'In terms of capital allocation, the priorities remain consistent over time, which is first and foremost to invest in our business through our own R&D activities internally as well as through business development. We also maintain optimized capital structure, which minimizes our weighted average cost of capital, and then we continue to provide growing dividend and returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases, which we expect to continue.', \"If you look over the period since 2011 for the company, you can see we've invested some $63 billion in the investment area through R&D, through acquisitions, as well as our own capital expenditures, and roughly an equivalent amount of $64 billion, we have returned cash to shareholders via share repurchases and our dividend, and we've also experienced very nice total shareholder return, which has substantially exceeded the S&P 500 index in that period.\", \"So concluding, we have a very good track record of execution as a company. We continue to focus on driving top line growth through volume driven growth. We're excited about the opportunity to add Otezla to the portfolio, focused on always looking for innovation in the area where we can have significant unmet need that we can address, and we always look to be first-in-class in differentiated molecules for our growth.

Yes. So as I mentioned, so we've recently in July of this year launched our first two biosimilars in the U.S. that being biosimilars for Avastin and which we call MVASI, and Herceptin which is known as Kanjinti. And I would say, first of all, there's a lot of questions about is the U.S. market developing? And is it functioning as a biosimilar market, and our answer to that is, absolutely yes. So, we feel confident that the evolution of the market will occur, obviously delayed vis-à-vis the experience in Europe, but as the first biotech company that faced competition from biosimilars, of course we have seen the impact and we do believe it's developing as it should. So that's point one.\", \"Point two is the FDA has established quite a high standard for approval, and there's only nine biosimilars that have been approved thus far in the U.S. of which three are coming from Amgen. So, we've seen a number of quite capable peers who run into challenges to get approval because of FDA’s expectations to ensure that they approve products that are going to be meeting the standards that they have.\", \"So again, notwithstanding that we believe the market is developing appropriately, we will continue to develop. In terms of the interest in our products, the biosimilars as I mentioned Avastin and Herceptin of course, we're well known to potential customers in the U.S. given our longstanding presence in oncology, and we're finding that there's a strong interest in those products from Amgen, I think in part because of the reliability of our supply as well as the proven track record for safety of the products that we produce.\", \"We've never had a shortage of products in the history of the company which is important in an area like this. So we believe that it will be a successful venture for the company, and we're excited about the opportunity, and more to come obviously we haven't reported any results yet in that we're in the first quarter of the launch.\", 'Graham Parry', \"And when you're thinking ahead about the sorts of penetration rates, you think biosimilars will get CGC, this is more of an oligopolistic market or do you see it’s more like a generic market, what kind of penetration of Avastin, Herceptin biosimilars?\", 'David Meline', \"Yes, it’s a great question. And obviously the experience that we have the best analog for us, of course, is the European experience where we faced biosimilar complication for a number of years. I would say, in the U.S. we'll have to see how the market develops there. Certainly, in the case of some products, such as Humira there are a number of biosimilars that have already been approved. There, the launch has been delayed and including our own, in our case until the beginning of 2023.\", \"But I think it will vary by product as to the number of competitors that come into the market, but given the size of the market, we think it'll be attractive and I think importantly for us, the barriers to entry are not insignificant, which starts with the technical capability to prove biosimilarity, which is not a simple task, and one of the reasons that we believe we’ll be one of the successful leaders in the space as the market develops.\", 'Graham Parry', \"I might just move on to the general pricing environment in the U.S., obviously it’s a very hot topic at the moment as the Trump administration seems to be wanting to push ahead with IPI at least appear to. Maybe, it's the tactic to try and make sure that the legislation passed in the Senate. But if we look at that, that IPI data with the HHS data, Amgen is one of the companies that comes up with the highest percentage of sales, where there is a big differential to international prices. So, we could perhaps address that specific element, and then the broader picture of how you see the drug pricing developing [indiscernible] US?\", 'David Meline', 'Sure. Yes, I guess first of all, we believe that reform is coming in the U.S. and the environment is going to change both due to the very competitive nature of the environment and the capable entrants to the market as well as the importance of affordability for patients in the U.S. which is obviously an important topic.', \"And our posture in this regard is really seeking three objectives as we interact, which we do very actively with the administration, the first being addressing and we believe there are a number of means to address patient affordability. Most recent example from Amgen is when we had a 60% reduction in the list price of Repatha which has a very positive impact in terms of the out of pocket expense for Medicare patients. So it's an example of addressing the affordability question which we think there are means to do that more broadly, secondly we think that access is important.\", \"It's been traditionally a market where patients have broad access to the latest modern medicines, and we think that's an important priority for the citizens and will continue to be something that they expect, and we support. And then the third priority, of course, is it's a very important sector of the economy and contributor to growth and jobs in the U.S. And we continue to enjoy support from the administration of Congress and the Senate who appreciate the importance of the contribution of biotech to the U.S. economy, and we always seek to keep that in front of people. As to the various means to improve affordability and access, obviously, IPI is one of those, we've not been a proponent of that measure, but we think there are a number of other means that need to be pursued to ensure ongoing affordability questions and access for patients.\", 'Graham Parry', 'Specifically on IPI, we discussed Moxie we expect there to be legal challenges and what was your expectation of it actually being able to pass on something which is interesting one?', 'David Meline', \"I think that would be a complicated path cycle that change the environment. And not only we think it's not a good idea, but the actual execution of that I think would be very difficult.\", 'Graham Parry', 'I’d like to switch gears on the recent Otezla acquisition. I think consensus valuation around that expectation was probably around $710 billion. So your 13 headline came in a bit above that and sort of communicate this tax benefits it exceeds six to 11. But perhaps could you help us understand what is that seeing the value of the product that street is missing clearly over the line on this slightly high valuation?', 'David Meline', \"Yes, thank you. Yes, so first I would comment that we continue to be very interested in adding to the company's portfolio with a particular focus on the six therapeutic areas where we have a presence both commercially and from an R&D perspective, we think inevitably, there's the best planning assets. And it tends to be those that have the expertise and have the presence in a particular area such as we do with inflammation where we have a long standing\", 'presence and capability in that area. So we were excited when the opportunity arose, we move quite aggressively on that opportunity. And for us the price as you said, 1311 after tax. You know, we looked at it, we have a mandate that we are pretty rigorous around, which is to demand to expect a return to our shareholders above their own cost of capital when we do acquisitions.', \"And this opportunity clearly exceeded threshold and there's a few key value drivers that we shared with the market to help them appreciate why we believe that we will indeed get a return for our own shareholders not just of just the sellers. And the first one being, we indicated that we believe over the next five years that we can generate growth for the product in the low double-digit percentage range. That compares with I believe the last 12 months of something around 25% growth for the products and we think that we have a very high level of \", 'confidence to achieve that kind of growth.', \"It's been approved in 50 countries and launched I think in a little over 30. So there's good growth opportunity not only in the U.S. but also internationally. We also believe that there's work being done to expand indications and that will also support the growth of the products. So value driver number one is continued growth of differentiated products that's well established already in the market. Second key driver of value, of course is the intellectual property, protection that the asset enjoys, we indicated that our legal team is confident that we'll have exclusivity in the U.S. at least through 2028. And we listened pretty carefully, our legal team is pretty well versed in terms of this area, and so we feel confident about that conclusion.\", \"And then thirdly, we gave some indication of the cost that we’d be taking on board with the asset and we think there's some very nice synergy opportunities for the company, in terms of both strategically as well as the leverage we can get from, we're offering all of the employees that are involved with this business, employment with Amgen, and we think there's great opportunity for them with the company and we believe will be able to grow and generate a nice return for the company.\", 'Graham Parry', \"So what's next on capital allocations and the target areas for biosimilars? What do you think there?\", 'David Meline', \"Yes, it’s a good question. And often, there's a discussion about well, this versus what about something else? And the answer we have is given the strength of both the balance sheet, we finished the second quarter with some $22 billion of cash. And if you look over the last several years, we've been generating typically upwards to $10 billion annually in free cash flow, very strong financial position.\", \"So we were clear as we announced this deal that we’ll continue to be in the market looking for additional opportunities to add to our own portfolio via business development and that we focus as I said earlier, we think the best buyer is typically somebody who's in an area, and has the expertise to understand what good looks like in terms of finance, and has the capability and contacts in the commercial environment. So we tend to focus at least on the later stage, business development opportunities in those areas where we have established a strategic presence.\", \"And what we've said is that we’ll continue to actively look, this doesn't interrupt our ability to seek additional acquisitions. And quite frankly, the way the market is evolving, we think there's going to be additional opportunities coming our way and we remain optimistic of those opportunities. And then finally, we also confirm that we expect our dividend continue to grow, which is important for some of our shareholder base, and that we see a continuation of returning excess capital to shareholders via repurchases which again we expect will continue even after having deployed some capital to this acquisition.\", 'Graham Parry', 'Question for approval like me to innovate, which is one of your more recent launches, a huge amount of noise around the launch but also an awful lot of competition discounting et cetera. So we think of volumes but the revenue is perhaps under initial expectations on the street. And so can you talk us through how you see that market developing? Do you think it will be able to retain that leadership from the market share and will there be get point which pricing volume is about beneficial?', 'David Meline', \"Yes, well the answer to the last part is yes, indeed, we continue to be very confident of this as a great opportunity for Amgen. And I think importantly for migraine sufferers. So you have in the U.S. market, some four million people are actively on some type of therapy for migraine and a much larger population who suffers from migraines, and there's never been a product that's been launched in the past that was specifically developed to address that very debilitating condition for people.\", \"So I think encouragingly, when we were the first to launch last year, May, we saw a very strong initial uptake of the product, which I think was reflective of the symptomatic nature of this disease. And it tends to be a very large portion of the population is in their active years, people in the 30s and 40s, who are raising families who have jobs, and who are highly affected by this condition. So very good initial uptake. We were then joined as we normally would be by a couple of competitors in the market some months later. And what I would say about it is, we've seen now the growth continues in the segment, we've now gotten to 225,000 of those patients. So again still a small fraction of those who are on therapy which leads us to believe that opportunity is very large.\", \"And as we move into a broader population on prescribed versus beyond just the specialists who have their migraine clinics, the uptake tends to be more gradual as you have a change of practice with biologic drug that's injectable. But we think the growth will be strong through time. In terms of pricing, we initially as the others had pre-drug programs to allow patients to experience the CGRP product. And as we work to get on formulary and convert them from\", 'free samples to paying.', \"So at the end of last year, roughly 50% of our prescriptions were paid prescriptions. By the end of the second quarter that have increased to 75%. So we're seeing that transition taking place. But I think that's part of what's the impact of the initial revenue because all of those prescriptions were counted as part of the figures being released. And so we and the others are now seeing that trend as they too get on formulary, we think we’ll be continue to be a leader in the space. But we have strong competitors. And we knew we would and we together with our partner, Novartis in this area, feel very good about our ability to compete on the ability to get a return, and most importantly about our ability to provide access to patients globally for this product. Any question?\", 'Graham Parry', 'Thank you. So you’re one of few biopharma companies that have innovative medicine and biosimilars in-house, so can talk to potential conflict of interest, but you advocate capital to a more risky, innovative development project vis-à-vis B, less innovative, less risky biosimilar product and also how you operate these, do you run them fully integrated or somehow separate?', 'David Meline', \"Yes, thank you for the question. And I think it's an important question because how you organize internally in the enterprise, ultimately impacts I believe your progress and success in moving into in this case of new market, which was unfamiliar to the company as prior to that we'd only been in the innovative business. So to the last point, you asked about, we did set up a standalone biosimilars team to give them the autonomy that they needed to during these initial development phases to move forward in developing the products.\", \"We also adopted and I think importantly in 2013, have some 70 strategic initiatives and priorities for the company of Amgen. One of those was this biosimilars efforts. So it's clear to everybody in the company, that this was a key and important strategic initiative for the company. So when they're making decisions, you can go back to okay, what's important to us and one of those was getting our biosimilars efforts up and running. But of course, not to the detriment of our innovative business but certainly a priority and we allocated both capital and expertise to that area which has been quite vital because as I said earlier, the technical challenges of getting approval of a biosimilar and launching are not insignificant.\", \"And some of our quite capable peers have realized that that this is a challenging task. So we have a unit that has responsibility to shepherd through the development phase. When we get to market then, we will transition to our commercial team of single commercial organization. And in many cases, we already have a presence in the therapeutic area such as oncology in the U.S. and we're able to take advantage of our commercial presence and it becomes an add on to that effort, then it's integrated because at least in the U.S. as well as some European markets, there’s an expectation of the kind of full suite of support for these products that you have with innovative products. So we're appropriately responding on with our efforts to support the products.\", 'In terms of the capital, we also made some very specific decisions to allocate capital in support of biosimilars. And, to describe to you that equation from my perspective, if I look at the innovative business typically a couple billion dollars to get to market with an innovative product maybe 1% likelihood of eventually getting to market and then a period of', \"exclusivity and growth for a product when you have success, biosimilars, if you're capable, you should have 100% chance to get the market. On average, we invest about $200 million to get to markets.\", \"So much higher likelihood to get there, much lower investment to get to market but obviously, a more constrained opportunity once you've arrived in the market but especially in the context of having available capacity, we think the equation is a good one from a financial return perspective for somebody like Amgen. And we've been able to manage and underwrite both of those without constraints. And after a number of years of development, we're now at the phase where we're getting to market and we're pretty excited about the opportunity both for patients, both for affordability, the competitive environment, meeting policy objectives, and we’ve been generating returns for Amgen.\", 'Graham Parry', 'Could you remind us splitting responsibility between you and Allergan on the biosimilars side and then what happens when they get acquired?', 'David Meline', \"Yes, so there are four, four of the assets that's where we co-invested. And it's indeed that, so we invested in those oncology efforts initially. And they subsequent to those initial efforts, their strategic focus shifted. So they had declared already before the announcement of the acquisition by AbbVie that that this was a de-prioritized area for them. So their role has been, and we believe will continue to be that of a more passive investor in the opportunity and will be actively then commercializing those products and that will is contemplated to continue in that form of post-acquisition.\", 'Graham Parry', 'Maybe just shift gears in last few minutes, a couple of assets. So obviously KRAS has been carrying a lot of attention. And most recent updates on marketing seems like emergency early on. So maybe you can just talk us through that data and whether you think the initial market reaction to it was fair, and what should we be looking out for the upcoming additional update?', 'David Meline', \"Yes, very good. Yes, so we will tag team a little bit on this. So we continue to be very excited about this innovation. This is a target KRAS that's been an area of interest for decades. And I think importantly, for us, it's a small molecule, which in some cases, people have been surprised though Amgen, we didn't know you had that kind of capability. But indeed, we do. And I think this is a really exciting demonstration of the capability that Amgen has across multiple modalities in our development capabilities.\", \"So we're pleased about that. We're pushing hard in terms of speed. So this has been in the clinic for somewhat less than a year, and we're making very nice and accelerated progress, which we’ll continue to drive very aggressively. And then in terms of the data while not 100% with a 54.4% response rate, we're very pleased with that. And I think the important point, it's a product that that's proven to be effective, and at least the initial indications that are no indications of any safety issues. So, but let me ask my colleague Arvind to add some additional comments.\", 'Arvind Sood', \"Sure. No, I think you've covered that well, David. Not pertaining the market reaction Graham, I would just add that the KOL, the key opinion leader feedback actually has been very positive on both those fronts. First of all, now we know that we can effectively inhibit mutations of KRAS G12C. And number two based on the data that we have reported so far there were no dose limiting toxicities, the safety profile looks very clean.\", \"So what's the have reported so far, this was a 76 patient Phase 1 study, that included 34 patients who were lung cancer patients, and of course, mutations KRAS G12C are most prominent in lung cancer. So this data was presented at the World Lung Conference Meeting, which was held roughly a week ago. And that's the data that David alluded to that the response rate was 54%. Within the 76 patient study, we had 36 patients with colorectal cancer and the balance with other tumor type. So that data is now going to be presented at the upcoming ESMO or the European Society of Medical Oncology. But I would note that the data cut off for both those cohorts for the lung cancer patients and colorectal cancer patients look the same it was back in July.\", 'Graham Parry', \"Okay. And if I could last couple maybe just want to bispecifics obviously a very broad portfolio actually. And if you go through the ones that are coming through, which are the ones that you would point in the market to being the most exciting, and then from an administration point of view and some of the feedbacks that we've had on this is that need certain infusions and regular infusions, that that's been somewhat limiting sense of the platform. So can you explain how that can become over time into a more commercial presentation?\", 'Arvind Sood', \"Yes, absolutely. So it'll be I mean, this is a platform the BiTE or bispecific T-cell engager platform is one that has been well validated in that we already have an approved product title on the market. It's approved and commercialized for a relatively small indication which is ALL or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. But beyond that, we’re also looking at other hematologic malignancies like AML, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, DLBCL which is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. And we are also looking at a combination of BLINCYTO together with a checkpoint inhibitor. And we'll see what the data used there.\", 'In addition to that, we also have a BiTE targeting BCMA or B-Cell Maturation Antigen. And we presented the initial data from that particular BiTEs which goes by the name or the number AMG 420 at last year’s ASH, the American Society of Hematology Meeting, again in this particular study we’ve demonstrated a very robust response rate, the response rate was 70%. But more importantly, we also showed that there were four patients with complete MRD or Minimum Residual Disease negativity.', 'We’ll provide an update on that as well in the near term and of course, you have rightfully pointed out Graham that one of the limitations to some of these, first generation BiTEs was the fact that they require a continuous infusion. So for most of our BiTEs, we are developing an extended half-life version. So for BLINCYTO which targets CD19, we have an extended half-life version in development, for AMG 420 that targets BCMA, we have an extended half-life version that goes by AMG 701.', 'And we expect the initial data from that in one of the spring medical meetings. And the last point that I would note on the BiTE platform is increasingly, we are very excited about this platform to the extent that we are even de-prioritizing some of the CAR-Ts that we were developing, targeting DLL3 which is a mutation that is quite prominent in lung cancer, and also FLT3 which is a mutation very prominent in AML for Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', \"But the one point that I would stress is that just because of BiTE had a continuous infusion doesn't necessarily disadvantage that in all indications, we have another BiTE targeting EGFRvIII or the Variant III for glioblastoma. And we expect to get the initial data, as David pointed out in his opening comments by the end of this year, for that particular indication actually having a continuous infusion BiTE maybe more advantageous. But it’s a broad platform, we’re very excited about the platform. And of course, we should be getting some results over the next several months.\", 'Graham Parry', \"That's great. I think the clock just flashed red. So we’re just on time. So thank you very much, David and Arvind. Good to see you. Thank you.\", 'David Meline', 'Thank you.'], ['Kingfisher plc (OTCQX:KGFHF) Q2 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call September 18, 2019  4:00 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Andrew Cosslett - Chairman', 'John Wartig - Interim CFO', 'Thierry Garnier - Chief Executive', 'Graham Bell - CEO, B&Q', 'Conference Call Participants', 'James Grzinic - Jefferies', 'Andy Hughes - UBS', 'Anne Critchlow - SG&A', 'Kate Calvert - Investec', 'Simon Irwin - Credit Suisse', 'Geoff Ruddell - Morgan Stanley', 'Geoff Lowery - Redburn', 'Tushar Jain - Goldman Sachs', 'Richard Chamberlain - RBC', 'Adam Cochrane - Citi', 'Alasdair McKinnon - Scottish Investment Trust', 'Tony Shiret - Whitman Howard', 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us today for the Kingfisher's Half-Year Results.\", \"For those of you who don't know me, my name is Andrew Cosslett. I'm the Chairman of Kingfisher Group. I'm joined today by John Wartig who joined the company as our Interim CFO back in April. And in addition to his CFO responsibilities, the Board also asked John to take over the running of our transformation office including a very specific and detailed focus on Castorama France as part of that. John has got deep operational experience of change management and his insights. Some of which you will hear in some detail today have been very valuable to both the Board and to Kingfisher team generally since he joined.\", \"We're also joined this morning by our incoming Chief Executive, Mr. Thierry Garnier, and you'll be hearing a few words from Thierry shortly. Thierry, welcome.\", \"We will follow the usual format this morning. I'll start with an overall summary of our performance before handing over to John who will run through the financials in more detail. And then of course, we'll return with a look at the priorities and then take your questions.\", 'So let me start with Slide 4 and the overall picture for the half year. While the transformation of the Kingfisher business continued during the half, further progress was made in unifying our products. We launched a number of innovative new ranges and we introduced further capabilities to our unified IT platform.', \"The financial performance in the half however, was mixed. Screwfix, Poland and Romania all delivered like-for-like sales growth in the period. At B&Q, LFL sales were 3.2% lower which included a 2% impact related to the discontinuation of our installation services last year. And of course the business continues to be exposed to the U.K.'s weak consumer backdrop. John will cover the performance drivers in more detail shortly.\", \"I should have said that we also have Graham Bell, here, who's the CEO of B&Q. So, any particular number of questions will be going straight to Graham. Welcome, Graham.\", 'So, the sales performance of Castorama France was impacted in roughly equal measure by the price repositioning that began in the latter half of last year, and by issues related to our change program that are impacting supply chain and logistics operations. The performance of Castorama France has been a major source of disappointment and concern to both our shareholders and our Board and rightly so. Later on, John will go through in detail the actions that we have underway to get on top of these issues.', 'The Brico Dépôt formats in France, gross margin rates and gross profit pounds were both high year-on-year. And lower sales and that reflects the proactive decision we took to reduce the level of low-margin promotional activity there.', \"On the digital front, the investments that we've been making are starting to gain some traction with good sales growth across the group from that channel. In the half, the group's overall gross margin rate grew by 60 basis points after clearance, the improvement largely coming as a result of our unified sourcing. Both the sales and gross margin rates of our unified products were up increasing by 0.4% and 150 basis points respectively.\", 'We would also note that gross profit pounds for the group as a whole were up year-on-year. Our balance sheet remained strong and in his section, John will take you through the detail of how IFRS 16 has impacted us. Overall then, a mixed picture for the half with some positive developments, but also clearly some key areas that we need to address.', \"Now, Thierry joins us next Wednesday and will take over the reins from Véronique who steps down next week too, or not, steps down next week. Now, given the closeness of this meeting to Véro's departure and the forward-looking nature of this presentation in many respects, we felt it was more appropriate for me to take comments and make comments in this area rather than Véro and hence her absence today.\", 'But let that not detract from the tremendous contribution that Véro has made to this business over many years. Over the last few months, Véro has remained fully committed to Kingfisher and has worked really hard to ensure that the transition with Thierry was an orderly one. She leaves with our best wishes for the future.', \"Now, turning briefly to Slide 5 and the key highlights before I pass on. 59% of the group sales in the half were unified. That's up from 42% in half one last year. While it inevitably takes time for new private label brands to establish themselves, sales of these ranges are growing and the benefits of unified sourcing are delivering a higher gross margin. And as we showcased at our Innovation Day in May, we've also started to increase the focus on the amount of product that is unique to Kingfisher with a number of key new ranges launched during the period.\", \"As I said, digital performance in the half was encouraging with digital now representing 7% of the overall sales volume for the group - sorry, sales value. And that's up from 6% last year, and looking back, 3% in 2016. Group digital sales were up 18% overall with Click & Collect growing by 24%. Each of our operating companies delivered growth in this area with all achieving higher website conversion and penetration rates.\", 'We are encouraged by the movement in our overall price tracker which again improved during the period and the latest set of Net Promotions Scores show an increase for each of our markets which is also reassuring.', \"Now, of course, the success of all the activity we're doing, in the end will be measured by revenues and profits. But these leading indicators are important signposts for us because they tell us that we're moving in the right direction.\", \"And last but by no means least, our colleague engagement scores remain very strong. This continue to sit above retail averages which is very encouraging given all the change and disruption that's taking place across that business in which as you might imagine can cause a negative impact on team and individual moral on occasions.\", \"So let me now introduce Thierry. Thierry is a highly experienced international retailer who has spent over 20 years leading large scale operations and successful change management journeys for Carrefour in France, South America and Asia. Most recently, he's been based in China where the pace of change in retail is quite extraordinary driven by the digital savvy customer.\", \"I'm absolutely delighted that Thierry is joining the company and I know he will make a big difference for us. Thierry, perhaps I could ask you to come and say a quick few words.\", 'Thierry Garnier', 'Well, thank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone.', \"It's a really great pleasure for me to be here and to meet you all. As you know, I will formally start in the business in a week from now, in a few days, but I think it's a great opportunity for me to introduce myself. So I don't want to let it pass.\", \"First, to tell you how excited I am to be joining Kingfisher and all the colleagues at Kingfisher in a few days’ time. I am a retailer. I have a deep passion for retail. I like spending time in stores with customers, with colleagues. I like building teams and mobilizing organization around addressing the changing needs of the customers. That's very important for me.\", 'A big part of it as well is around digital. As you know, I spent several years in China. So, digital is very important for me. I would say the passion as well. And I think we have a lot of opportunities ahead of it.', 'Maybe let me tell you a few things about my experience, as Andy just mentioned. I spent the most recent years in Asia. I was based in Shanghai, leading Carrefour’s Asia operation. As many of you knows, you follow retail, China is now a retail laboratory for the world.', 'And we led - Carrefour, we led in Asia and in China big transformation plan. First, this is about new format, new convenience store format, new big box format. We as well established a very large new supply chain in many different cities in China to improve fulfillment and availability. This was around digital. So we build a very big food online operation in China.', 'We did many partnership with the Chinese digital ecosystem like Alibaba, Tencent, etcetera, if you know those companies. And at last at the same time, we had to take tough decisions on costs. It’s the closure, downsizing of stores, reduction of cost overall, and all these plans drove much better - I would say much better results of the Asian zones forecast in the past two to three years.', 'And the last example I would like to give you is we launch in 2015 food online operation and by this summer it would present the largest Carrefour food online operation by the number of order per day or by the participation.', \"Previously, I've worked extensively as well in France in many different formats and I led the transformation, you know we had transform from Benelux, I led the transformation from Champion to Carrefour market a few years ago that was a successful transformation for over 1,000 supermarkets.\", \"Maybe last thing to say in China as in France I've been working in metrics organization where getting the balance right between the center and the operating companies. Central market is obviously a key success factor.\", \"As in clearly today, I’m in a position to listen. I’m not in a position to take questions. It’s too early for me. But just to let you know in the past couple of weeks I've had the opportunity to listen to many of the largest shareholder of Kingfisher and I wish to continue to have this conversation. I'm sitting down in London, I will leave in London. So, now it would be much easier for me to meet with all of you and looking forward to meeting you properly face to face in the coming few months.\", 'So, thank you all, and now I hand you over back to Andy. Thank you.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Thanks Thierry.', 'So, from what Thierry said, he’s now starting for a few days, so probably a bit early to going to be answering questions today. But I know he wants to engage over the next few months to as many of you as possible.', \"Now, despite not being in the chair, Thierry has already been very engaged with me over the last few months on the important task of filling gaps and adding new talent to our leadership team. We've had a lot of change at the top of this organization over the past few years and we now need to fill out this executive team, settle it down and move forward to get under Thierry’s leadership.\", \"We do need to attract more talent to this business and while of course we will always have deep sector knowledge in the team, the balance of the team would benefit from more class-leading functional skills, some more experience of change management, and from best practice from the wider world of retail. We've been working hard on this throughout the summer and we expect to have a steady flow of news on senior appointments over the next few months.\", 'Now, with that, let me just hand it over to John, who is going to come out now and take you through the financial performance in more detail. John?', 'John Wartig', 'Thanks Andy, and good morning, everyone.', \"In terms of structure, I'm going to start by giving you an overview of the group's performance in the half before taking you to the detail and the drivers. And as Andy mentioned, part of my rolling vote during the group’s transformation office. And so, I’m going to give you some insights and actions on this, in Castorama France specifically. I’ll then update you on the outlook for the full year.\", 'Before I start, just to remind you that from 3rd of February this year, we have adopted IFRS 16, the new accounting standard for leases. All the numbers presented are therefore under the new standard and the restated comparatives are in line with what we published to the market in our IFRS update last month.', 'Turning to Slide 7 in an overview of the income statement. Total group sales was £6 billion and down 0.9% and like-for-like down 1.8% based on a constant currency basis. Gross margin for the group was up 60 basis points and both reported in constant rate. This was a solid margin performance with the sourcing and price repositioning benefit partly offset by logistics and stock inefficiencies largely in Castorama France, as well as incremental clearance.', 'As a result of the margin improvement, gross profit was slightly ahead of half one last year with operating costs up just over 2% on last year. Retail profit was down 4.4% on a constant currency basis to £466 million.', 'Adjusted profit before tax which is after central costs, interest and transformation costs was up 3.7% in the period to £337 million, reflecting the expected reduction in transformation costs year-on-year.', 'And I’m pleased to say in the next financial year, we’ll simplify our reporting by removing the underlying profit measure, given that the vast majority of the transformation P&L costs will have been incurred by the end of the current year.', 'Our adjusted effective tax rate was down slightly at 26%. Adjusted basic earnings per share were up7.3% reflecting the lower tax rate and the impact of last year’s buyback. Statutory EPS, which is after exceptional items, was down 15.6%. Finally, the board has maintained the interim dividend of £0.0333.', 'So, now, let me take you through the exceptional charges of £93 million for the first half of the year. These largely relate to the ways we are dealing with the underperforming parts of our business.', 'The first component, a charge of £68 million, relates to the redundancy provisions associated with the 11 planned store closures in France over the next 18 months, and the previously announced store closures in Germany, which completed during the period. Sales of freehold stores subject to closure expected to cover these cash costs of exit.', 'The Russian-Iberia charge of £26 million largely reflects store impairments in Russia. Given the challenging conditions in that market, we announced last year that we are focusing on markets where we are leading or can become the market leader, and therefore made the decision to exit Russia and Iberia. Both processes are ongoing.', 'Moving on to Slide 9 Let me now cover the performance of our major geographies, which as you can see from this overview is mixed with weaker sales performance in the U.K. and France offset by higher gross margins. There was a modest decline in profit in U.K. of 1.7% and 12.2% decline in France. Poland was broadly flat. And the losses from the other remaining geographies were flat year-on-year.', 'On to Page 10 and performance in the U.K. and Ireland. Against the backdrop of a weaker consumer and a softer housing market, B&Q delivered a negative 3.2% LFL for the half which as Andy mentioned earlier, includes negative 2% from the discontinuation of installation services at the end of Q3 last year.', 'There were several other factors that impacted the top line as follows. The ongoing implementation of new ranges including s surfaces & décor and kitchens caused disruption, while weather-related categories were down nearly 3% against the strong comparative driven by very hot weather in Q2 last year.', 'And as reminder, our Q2 finished at the end of July. Digital sales, however, continues to grow, up 10% now representing 5% of total B&Q sales. And we also saw a modest benefit from home-based store closures. Screwfix continues to gain market share through its convenience model and strength in digital. Like-for-like sales grew by more than 5% while digital sales grew by 18% now representing 32% of Screwfix sales.', 'We also opened another 16 stores in half one taking the total number of stores 643. We look forward to the business opening its first store in the Republic of Ireland later this year. And our store-opening target for the full year remains unchanged.', 'Gross margin for the U.K. & Ireland increased by 60 basis points benefiting from unified sourcing and B&Q’s discontinuation of installation services. The margin in the second half of the year will be impacted by incremental clearance from B&Q’s old kitchen range and ongoing investment in price in Screwfix. Overall constant currency retail profit in the U.K. was lower by 1.7%.', \"Continuing on to Slide 11, LFL sales in France were down 4.4%. This compares unfavorably with Banque de France's data for the French DIY market for the same period which was up nearly 2%.\", \"Looking at each of business in turn, Brico Dépôt is 4.6% like-for-like decline was driven by the proactive reduction in lower margin promotional activity which had a negative 5% impact on Brico's like-for-like.\", \"As a result of this action, gross profit pound increased year-on-year. At Castorama, we saw a decline of 4.3% largely reflecting price repositioning and transformation-related activity which I'll talk more about in the next slide.\", 'Total France gross margin increased 60 basis points with an increase at Brico Dépôt partly offset by logistics and stock inefficiency at Castorama. Overall, the increase in France gross margin rate was not enough to offset the like-for-like decline and retail profit in France ended up lower by 12.3% at constant rate.', \"Turning to Slide 12 and an update on Castorama. First, I'll recap on where we are today, give some insight on some of the operational issues we are working through and then highlight the area of focus. During that period, we launched a number of new major ranges including outdoor, Surfaces & Décor, Bathroom & Storage, and Tools & Hardware. And around 60% of the offer is now new unified products.\", \"Surface & Décor is an important category for Castorama and there was disruption as the new ranges landed adverse the impacting like-for-like sale. On a more positive note, the leading customer indicated we're moving in the right direction. For example, price perception is an improving trend and customer Net Promoter Scores have improved by five points over the year.\", \"The price index has also come down and now only slightly above our closest competitor. Digital sales, click & collect and website conversion rates are also up by Castorama, albeit, of a small base. The key for the business will improve the effectiveness of enabling technologies and operational processes. And that's what we're working hard on.\", 'To contextualize, the operating model across Kingfisher today is underpinned by unified IT platform along with a split of responsibilities across local markets. And our group offer in-sourcing organization.', 'Applying this model to Castorama France, which comes from a legacy of a decentralized model, has been highly challenging. The implementation of the change program at Castorama France has, therefore, caused issues and continues to cause issues.', 'In our stock planning, stock management and logistics processes which in turn is leading to lower than expected stock availability and fulfillment rate. These issues have arisen due to ongoing challenges with vendor management, product data and changes to store operations which are all being aligned to the new IT platform, operational processes, and unified ranges within the business.', 'Let me illustrate this with a simple example. Castorama is currently working with over 1,000 vendors who are each required to comply with the fine processes around ordering, receiving and invoicing. If a vendor fails to comply with the ordering process, this can mean stock is received but booked into the stock system manually requiring significant time and effort through workarounds be completed. This in turn can lead to temporary inaccurate stock records, additional costs and delays.', 'To amplify this, we’re incurring additional costs due to running legacy system in parallel during the transitional phase. These operating issues are typically manifesting itself in the supply chain which ultimately has an impact on our stores, online, and, of course, our gross margin. Therefore, correcting the underlying operational issues is a key area of focus for us.', 'Alongside the implementation of new differentiated ranges, we will continue to work to improve the effectiveness of Castorama’s IT platform along with the efficiency of its operational processes and fulfillment function. Part of getting this right is to review and adjust when necessary, the balance of responsibilities between group and Castorama.', 'We believe we have identified the pain points and have a series of ongoing detailed work streams to both eliminate the underlying issues and take corrective action to drive through the benefits of the change program.', 'Over time, this should improve the overall performance of our supply chain and logistics operation which is essential for Castorama to be in a position to grow again. We’ll also launch the next stage of our e-commerce platform in the second half to support continued digital growth.', 'Turning to cost and store performance, cost benefit are being delivered from the 5% FTE reduction that took place in the second half of last year following the transition to our financial services center in Poland. And following consultation processes, we’ll be closing nine underperforming Castorama stores over the next 18 months.', 'In summary, the performance of Castorama continues to disappoint. However, the business has taken important steps to improve its customer proposition its offer its price competitiveness and its e-commerce capability. The primary causes of the operational issues have been identified and we’re taking the necessary actions to address them. This will take time but we have a focus work planning place to deliver tangible and sustainable improvements in these areas.', 'Turning to Poland and Romania. Poland delivered good LFL sales growth of 3.3%, benefiting weather-related category particularly in Q1. We estimate that Sunday trading restrictions which we moved one further day of trading per month impacted like-for-like sales growth by 1 percentage point in half one.', 'Poland’s growth margin was down 20 basis points, largely due to higher clearance and higher outdoor sales which are lower margin. Cost increases related to wage inflation, higher digital costs and pre-opening costs as we open two new stores during the half also impacted margins. As a result, retail profit was broadly flat.', 'In Romania, like-for-like sales increased by 10.5%. Contributing to this was a good performance in unified ranges. Praktiker stores have now been rebranded as Brico Dépôt with the final store to complete the second half of this year.', 'In addition, the quality of ranges has both improved as it’s expanding in terms of SKU. This is however a period of transition for Romania and the overall business made a retail loss of £8 million, driven by losses in the form of Praktiker stores. Towards the end of H2, we will start the back-office integration process for the businesses. It should be noted we are currently running both businesses separately.', \"Let's now turn to Slide 14 in the remaining geographies. Combined like-for-like sales in Iberia, Russia and Screwfix Germany declined by 4.9% with reported retail loss of £5 million including equity accounting profits from our JV in Turkey. Our exit processes in Russia and Iberia are progressing. We are currently reviewing a number of options for both businesses and we’ll update you as soon as we can.\", 'Spain continues to generate a small profit plus the trading environment in Russia remains challenging resulting in the impairment that I mentioned earlier. In Germany for Screwfix, we have now closed all 19 stores and that we know further Germany related losses in the second half.', 'Moving on to Slide 15, we can say that unified and unique ranges continue to outperform our non-unified ranges in both sales and gross margin. 59% of sales were from unified and unique ranges which grew by north 0.4% against a north 0.9% decline in the non-unified ranges.', 'We achieved growth in four of our seven categories. Of the two negative categories, one experienced significant range changes during the period and the other face tough weather-related comparatives. Before logistics and stock inefficiencies, all categories delivered growth profit growth, demonstrating the ongoing benefits of unified sourcing.', 'On Slide 16, we set our bridge of the group gross margin movement of 60 basis points for half one. We can see that 150 basis point gross margin improvement in unified product has driven an 80 basis point benefit across the group while the margin on non-unified offer was flat year-on-year.', 'As a positive margin drivers for the group included price repositioning, mainly driven by Brico Dépôt which led to a 30 basis points positive improvement and the discontinuation of installations at B&Q which had a 20 basis points positive impact.', 'Partly offsetting factors included incremental clearance ahead of the new ranges launched in half one, which had a 40 basis points impact year in the period. And as highlighted earlier, logistics and stocking efficiencies mainly in Castorama, France, had a 30-basis-point impact on margin.', 'Slide 17, this provides an overview of our cash flows and a summary of our net deposition under IFRS 16. Firstly, on cash flow, we generated £695 million of EBITDA in half one and paid €236 million of net rent. Moving through the bridge, there was a £45 million outflow working capital and this reflected an increase of stock of £111 million which was driven by store expansion, changes in operating model and higher stock level primarily in France.', 'This was partly offset by a net increase in credit of £66 million. Bear in mind, we are looking here at the movement in working capital over the six-month period. The seasonality plays a part. However, as mentioned earlier, improving stock management and planning process is a key area of focus to cast around the fans.', 'After capital expenditure of £163 million and tax and interest payments, free cash flow in the period was £204 million. Income from property disposals is largely driven by a small number of sale and leaseback transactions in B&Q. After dividends, the movement in cash was positive £131 million, helping to improve our cash balance to £385 million at the end of the half.', \"Under IFRS 16, which I'll cover in a moment, you'll be aware our lease liabilities of £2.6 billion are now included on our balance sheet. Our lease liabilities were largely unchanged since year-end, but the improved cash position helped reduce our net debt by £158 million during the period. As a result, our restated net debt to EBITDA ratio fell from 2 times to 1.8 times, which remains consistent with our objective of maintaining our solid investment grade credit rating.\", \"Turning now to Slide 18 and our full year 2019-2020 outlook and technical guidance. Full technical guidance is outlined in this slide so I'll just pick out a few items. As we enter the second half, the outlook for our main markets remains mixed. The U.K. market in particular remains uncertain in the short term in B&Q. The discontinuation of installations will – annualized at the end of Q3.\", 'In France, we expect Castorama to underperform, and the reduction in promotional activity annualizes in Brico Dépôt at the end of Q3. Excluding Russia and Iberia, we continue to expect gross margin after clearance to be flat year-on-year. Some of the positive margin drivers in half one such as price repositioning at Brico Dépôt and discontinuation of installations at B&Q will not fully repaid in half two.', 'In addition, we have also slight upped our incremental clearance guidance for the full year to £30 million to £35 million from £25 million to £30 million, which includes clearance for B&Q kitchens in half two. Screwfix will also ramp up its investments in price in the second half.', 'We now expect central costs to increase to around £55 million, which are £5 million higher than previously guided, largely reflecting additional activity at the center as we strengthen our resources and leadership team. For this year, transformation P&L costs are now expect to be around £50 million to £60 million.', 'Our guidance on CapEx remains unchanged. We expect total CapEx to be up to £375 million which includes investments to support the unified range implementation, new store openings in Poland, as well as investment in fulfillment capabilities. And finally, in respect of store closures, we continue to expect any future cash costs of exit to be covered by our sale proceeds from the owned stores.', 'Slide 19. On this slide, we summarize the impact of implementing IFRS 16, the new accounting standard for leases. We adopted a full retrospective transition approach in the 1st of February, 2019. The first thing to say is that the new standard has no impact on cash flows or the underlying economics of the business. The table on this slide show the respective impacts on retail profit and the balance sheet for last year’s full and half year.', 'In FY 2018, 2019, retail profit increased by £171 million as the pre-IFRS 16 rental charge is replaced by a lower depreciation charge. By geography, the main impact is in the U.K. due to the high proportion of lease stores. However, after IFRS 16 impact on interest costs of £169 million, the net benefit to underlying profit before tax is negligible.', 'In terms of the balance sheet, net asset at 31 January, 2019 have reduced as expected. This reflects the new right of use asset of £2 billion and the new lease liability of £2.6 billion, which is lower compared to the liability which is derived under IAS 17 from our previous assumption of 8 times property operating lease rental. As a result, the net debt-to-EBITDA multiple at end of last year is restated 2 times under IFRS 16 versus 2.6 times under IAS 17.', 'Moving to Slide 20. We will set out the steps taken to manage Brexit and foreign exchange risks. We do not anticipate any significant change to stock levels in the 31st of October no-deal Brexit scenario and have sufficient stock in place to cover near-term demand. We’ll continue to monitor this position and take action if needed.', 'With regard to tariffs and customs, if the governments counterproposal for no-deal tariffs are confirmed, it would have neutral impact as most of our products would carry a 0% tariff. We’ve also updated our implementation process to prepare for a hard border between the U.K. and the EU, including FX to simplified custom’s procedure and alternative cross channel and deep sea ports of entry. We also remain engaged with key vendors in this area. On talent, as you’d expect, we are keeping a close eye on retention and hiring but haven’t a noticeable impact to-date. We’ve also been helping some existing employees to gain settled data.', 'Now, looking at foreign exchange exposure. Of our total annual GOGS balance of £7 billion, around 20% is purchased in U.S. dollars which half relates to the U.K. We have in place an 18-month rolling hedging program to hedge all committed orders against changes in FX rates for the U.S. dollar and the euro along with a significant percentage of our forecast net exposure, above and beyond what is committed. There is also some protection from cost price inflation from our existing stock level and some of our existing supply agreement.', 'Finally, to summarize, the first half sales performance was mixed, but frankly, disappointing. The positive performance at Screwfix and in Poland were offset by France and B&Q. For Castorama France, the primary causes of the operational issues have been identified and we have a work - a focused work plan in place to deliver tangible and sustainable benefits over time.', 'Encouragingly, group margin was ahead by 60 basis points benefiting from unified sourcing and price repositioning. The business remains cash generative and we retain a strong balance sheet. These results were delivered against the challenging backdrop, and the outlook for our main markets remains mixed. This is particularly the case in the U.K. where Brexit uncertainty remains high. Finally, we have reiterated our guidance of a flat gross margin percentage after clearance for the full year.', 'And with that, I’ll now hand back to Andy. Thank you.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Thank you. Thanks John.', \"So, just moving onto the final section, I think it's generally acknowledged by most people that what it takes to win in mainstream retailing these days is quite different to where it was a few years ago perhaps. And while the core disciplines of retailing remain as necessary as ever, they are no longer sufficient.\", 'Mainstream retailers today certainly need to be recognizably competitive on price, offer great value, they need to deliver ultimate convenience through a seamless integration of their physical stores and digital platforms, and they need to present a range of products and services which differentiate them from their competition. Kingfisher in its old form ticked a few of these boxes.', 'So, both to survive and prosper into the future, the group really had to make some fundamental changes as to how it went to market and to its internal ways of working. It needed to become much more efficient to generate the source of funds it needed to reinvest in the customer proposition. Invest the prices, in digital capability and in the quality of its product.', \"Kingfisher's strategic approach is pretty simple. You can see it in this slide at the top of the house on the slide. So using our scale more intelligently for the benefits of our customers seems a fairly obvious thing to want to do. Scale is one of Kingfisher's greatest assets and it would do – it does seem odd not to want to deploy that as a competitive advantage.\", 'To make it pay on a scale pay, we need to get two discrete blocks of activity right. First, we need to have the right customer proposition; the right balance of local, international and private label brands; competitive prices; leading-edge digital experience; active management and development of our stores; brilliant customer service; and the Screwfix, in particular, a well resource expansion plan to maximize its tremendous growth potential.', \"And at the heart of all these is our team. It's absolutely vital that they are working in sync with real clarity of understanding about what's best done in the center and what's best done staying local. This is a critical part of making our revised operating model work and it's an area that we're keeping under close review. Certainly, an area here is going to be spending a lot of time.\", 'Now, underpinning that superstructure, we have what we call our enablers. These are the services and infrastructure platforms that connects our business. And then once fully installed will allow it to function much more efficiently. These enablers include our sourcing capability, IT, supply chain, and shared services.', 'Now, most of these enablers have either been completely rebuilt or built from scratch over the last three and half years. We’ve centralized what was a completely desperate sourcing model in which each operating company was fully responsible for its own ranging. We’ve implemented a common IT platform capable of delivering significant operational efficiencies and clear customer benefits.', \"We've launched a scalable e-commerce capability across the business and we've leveraged our scale to establish group-wide GNFR and shared service capabilities. These are fundamental changes to our DNA and so our ways of working that will allow our scale advantage to be fully realized. Now much of this work has worked and it's worked well. As I mentioned earlier, sales and margin from our unified offer continues to grow.\", \"We're seeing quality output now really coming through in the area of product design and digital sales as you've seen on the rise. But it's equally clear that some of the enabling technology and operational processes are not working as well as they need to. As you've heard, the performance of Castorama France being the key area where the enablers are not yet working well enough and it's been highly disappointing.\", \"We know the benefits of what we've built there, but we did not yet see them flowing through to the customer or into our financial results. The fact is I believe that we underestimated the operational financial disruption that IT supply chain and product range transformation at this scale would cause and as a result we're incurring too much duplication and remediation cost and our trading performance is being hampered.\", 'Now, while these enablers are largely now in place, we need to make them work more effectively and we are 100% clear that execution in this regard is our first priority.', \"On Slide 24. This has been a busy year as we said it would be for new range launches. And the first half of the year was particularly busy. And many of these new products, as we've said, are unique to Kingfisher, which is a trend which we shared with you at our Innovation Day in May. Extensions to our highly-successful bathroom's range landed in half one as did new outdoor ranges and a revamped tools and hardware offer.\", \"Unified ranges for surfaces and décor, which is the group's largest category by sales, are now being rolled out. And the much anticipated new kitchens ranges will arrive in B&Q during the second half of this year with introductions into France planned for next year.\", \"As we've heard, all this activity does cause disruption in store and sometimes in our system. But we are nearly through the heavy lifting and the changes are key to turning up the dial with our customers over time.\", \"So, Slide 25 and our priorities for this year. It's essential then, and I hope we've made this clear, that we are going to tune up the key enablers of our transformation program, IT, digital, supply chain. These underpin the long-term growth of our business. It's also essential and a real priority that we get on top of the underperforming elements of our business, particularly in Castorama France. And the two issues clearly are linked.\", \"And, in addition, we need to see through other pieces of work which remain outstanding. Following relevant consultations, we're committed to closing 15 stores across the business, including 11 in France over the next 18 months. And most of these will take place in the full year to the end of 2021 - up to the end of our year 2021. And we are reviewing, as you've heard, a number of options with regards to our planned exits from Russia and Iberia.\", \"And just a word on Screwfix. As planned, we're looking to expand this business faster by taking action in our core U.K. market including continued investments in price. At the same time, we’re going to be pushing ahead faster with our international rollout plans. We’re on track with our U.K. store openings program. We're on track for our first store opening in the Republic of Ireland, and we're continuing to validate urgently the potential of this brand in the French and Polish markets.\", 'Now the success of all the above will ultimately be measured by a return to group sales growth which we are confident about in the medium to long term. We believe our margins and our cash generation can grow as the inefficiencies related to stock management and logistics clearance and dual-running costs are driven out of the system, and the benefits of scale are finally allowed to flow down to the bottom line.', 'And to summarize then and close on Slide 26, Kingfisher remains financially strong and is well-placed with leading positions first or second in the market in which it operates, all of which have long-term growth potential. The transformation that started nearly four years ago now has continued across the group in the first half of this year. Most of the building blocks to support future growth are now in place and the focus very much now is on proving the effectiveness of our enabling technology and processes.', \"In terms of guidance, the outlook for our main markets remains mixed with the U.K. in particular facing continued uncertainty that is affecting the consumer and the housing market. Kingfisher continues to expect a flat gross margin percentage for the full year after clearance. And to close, we're very much looking forward to Thierry joining us as new CEO next week and to him bringing a completely fresh perspective to everything we do.\", \"His experience will be invaluable in taking advantages of the considerable opportunities we know this business still has in front of it. He’s engaged in the plan to bring new talent into our executive team urgently, and I'm very confident he's going to hit the ground running.\", \"So, thank you very much for listening and your attentiveness. John and I would be very happy now to take any questions you might have. And please I do apologize for not knowing all your names at this point. But if you could raise your hand, I'll take you in order and we will, please if you could say your name, that would be great as well.\", 'I think the gentleman in the blue shirt was first and then we’re going to the gentleman in front.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - James Grzinic', \"It's James Grzinic from Jefferies. I appreciate the added transparency in Castorama France. And in the spirit of that, I'm wondering whether if you can give us more details in terms of when were you able to exactly articulate what was going on and at what point did you start putting remedial action to work?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', \"I think we started to become aware that potentially the early signs started about this time last year in terms of starting to believe that there was - tensions in mid-teens which is usually the leading indicator that there are deep problems. I think the actual supply chain issues didn't really manifest themselves until the spring and since the spring and John's arrival, we've been able to increase the line of sight that we've had on those issues rapidly. And in that discovery process we found a lot more going on.\", \"So, we've been making fixes since then and John's been highly engaged in that. We're working with obviously our teams in France. And because it's a combination of IT and supply chain working together, it's complex but highly important set of things we've got in place now in such work streams.\", 'So that’s really been the issue. I think that was the first time back in the last year but really in terms of the manifestation probably in the spring.', 'Andy Hughes', \"It's Andy Hughes from UBS. I've got a few related questions here. Just picking up with the £68 million exceptional charge, I mean, it seems a pretty hefty sum. I mean there's about 11 big stores and I guess 19 tiddlers in Screwfix that seems quite big charges. Is there any stock clearance within that? So, is the stock within the stores being cleared?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Consultation related to the actual program itself primarily in terms of France [indiscernible].', 'Andy Hughes', 'Right, okay. So, nothing on stock?', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Nothing.', 'Andy Hughes', \"Yes, and just moving on to stock. Obviously you've got certainly over £2.8 billion of stocks or stocks have been going up while your sales have been going down. Can you give us any sort of feel for what the [indiscernible] new products, or not new products old products. So can you give us a split? I mean the 59% of sales are in new categories, is that mirrored in your stock or is there more or less in terms of…\", 'Andrew Cosslett', \"As you've alluded to, it’s a combination of that amount. We have got - has buildup has been - as we’re bringing in the new ranges, we need to actually have a peak in actually building new inventory for the sell-through. That should graduate over time. But also, we've got a growing amount particularly in France of actually stock that's actually now ready for clearance. So, that’s got to work through as well. So, I think there's been a buildup in both. New ranges coming through and then we've also had the deleted items that we've got to work through as well.\", \"In terms of a number where that should get to, I’d hesitate to give a number at the moment, but I think we do need to actually reduce this in both areas. What will happen naturally as the new ranges come in but the other actually the non-unified ranges are those that have been deleted that'll have to reduce over the next 6 to 12 months.\", 'Andy Hughes', 'The outlines - is going to be discontinuing what, sort of rough percentages inventory is that?', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'To give you a number, it will be sort of 5%.', 'Andy Hughes', \"Okay. So that's quite low. So, I mean, what I'm trying to get at is when is the magic year going to be when you get your supply chain change coming through when you don't have the clearance to offset it. Is that for 2021?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Yeah. I see where you're coming from. I'm very intimidated, right. Why didn’t you say, what's our baseline clearance and everything goes through. I think we're going to need another year and a half at a minimum. It definitely won't happen this year. We still have new ranges coming in particularly in kitchens in France next year. And then there will be some range extensions of the existing ranges we'll put through.\", \"So, I think it's probably another year and a year and a half before we get into a normalized level but we don't have a total fix on that at the moment.\", 'Anne Critchlow', \"Anne Critchlow from SG. Two questions for me please. When do you think you'll be able to drop the legacy supply chain systems in France? And then secondly, what percentage of products is now relating to the product unique to Kingfisher?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', \"It's a good question on the legacy. I'm on it. No. It's definitely. I think that's been an issue as we've been transitioning. We're not actually launching or completing the IT platform rollout in Brico Dépôt during the course of this year. We're working up through with the team really looking during the course of next year.\", \"Second half of next year, all I would say is dropping the core legacy systems and that will actually release that duplication and some of the costs for both the IP area. Part of that obviously is going to be dependent on how quickly we can move through these ways of working, the processing engineering that's required. Because as Andy said, as well as I said that both of these models have been decentralized models that we actually have to centralize and then actually get the processes in ways of working but I'm aiming for the second half of next year.\", 'John Wartig', \"And a unique number. I believe. I'll be corrected if it’s wrong, 6%? 6% to 7%?So, it’s still relatively low. But, as you saw, if you were there in May, it's an area where we think there is a lot of mileage and the opportunities to be more innovative. And we have invested quite heavily in the last few years in product design capability that we never had before. So, we do actually have now teams of people coming up with our own customer-focused innovative products, which we're now getting our new supply base we need to make it work.\", \"So, again, it's a journey, but we are confident that that’s going to rise. But, again, one of the questions for Thierry is exactly how far does that go, what's through the sale and investment of that, and how does that stack up against international brands and local brands, which is a part of that customer proposition piece that we were talking about.\", 'Kate Calvert', \"Kate Calvert from Investec. Can you explain why Brico Dépôt didn't have the same supply chain issues as Casto, and what's been different in the implementation?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Well, two things. First of all, Brico Dépôt isn't fully on the template yet. It hasn't been fully transitioned. That will happen in the second half of this year. And, secondly, I think a major component there is actually has significantly less SKUs. Now, if you take Castorama, it is close to 60,000 SKUs. But, currently, Brico Dépôt only has 13,000, and also a total of less unification. So, the complexity there has been less.\", \"But, also, I’d like to think that we've learnt some of the lessons from what's actually transpired just recently with Castorama. There's a lot of the same people that are working on that. And I think the last point to add, not a small point, the master data which is critical to this was actually in much better shape in Brico Dépôt because of its legacy of how it run its business.\", 'John Wartig', \"I think that’s very important. Sorry. If I may, just to add, too, here is a really important point. All our different OpCos started in different place. We were never in a rollout situation that some companies have. We were in a situation where we had legacy businesses that all were running differently. And we've had to migrate them all to this new feature.\", \"And what this meant is, the ones that have had the longest journey to travel of the centralized curve, which is Castorama, we found it most challenging. Brico Dépôt has always had a fair amount of centralized within their culture and their management structures and framework. It's always been much more essential model. So I think that really helps psychologically. And in the stores, people are prepared to follow and understand central instructions much more rapidly. So it's a combination of all those things I think together which answers the question. So do you have any follow-up?\", 'Kate Calvert', 'No, I don’t. No. That’s great.', 'Simon Irwin', \"Simon Irwin from Credit Suisse. A few random questions. Can you talk a bit about footfall at Castorama? I'm intrigued by your kind of comments around NPS going up. I mean, what's happening? Are people just not coming to the store and finding for availability in which case it’s quite surprising that the Net Promoter Score is improving? Can you just talk a bit more about that dynamic?\", 'Second is how has GoodHome gone down as a brand within the business? It’s clearly a very important initiative for the group. And can you just talk a bit about clearance and guidance. My impression was that clearance is used maybe a bit more first half weighted and now you took that in the exact uplift.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Thanks, Simon. I mean, I’ll take the first if I may and then John maybe a little bit more about clearance. So, footfall is down obviously. We don’t know – I don’t know by how much but it’s said probably by a quarter in the last thereabouts – imagine saying thereabouts but we have lots and lots of footfall over there, two or three years.', 'Part of that has been reaction to the ELDP strategy which we’ve implemented. We brought the overall price index of Castorama down substantially by about 5, 6 points over the last couple of two-and-a-half years. But in doing that, we’ve also taken away the price points by certainly you’re getting promotional activity and we know that a fair portion of people who came into the store were coming in on promotion deals only which is the same Brico Dépôt.', 'So, the strategy was around trying to make sure that we had a more widely understand universal messages everyday low price which people would respond to. So I don’t think they’re in conflict. I think the fact that we’ve got lower footfall is a reality which we are trying to address to all the things we’ve talked about. But the fact that the NPS score because you do NPS scores with the people who shop with you.', 'So, I think we’re actually providing a better service and product and experience for the people that actually use the store in a way we would like them to use it which is a place to come as their first choice home improvement center. The promotional people have gone for now and it’s our job to convert them into loyal customers, not just bill seekers. So, I think that’s what’s happening.', 'Simon Irwin', 'GoodHome?', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'GoodHome is very new. We’ve spent a lot of time building that brand and just putting it together. It’s our first multi-regional, multi-category entry and I think it is important as you say, not just because it is our first one it’s like that, and is therefore a really interesting brand departure for us. But also because it ticks some boxes which some of our other brands are quite successful on such as the sustainability platform and the profile of the brand which we know are going to be really important for customers going forward.', \"It’s landing well, but it's just rolling out. It's just beginning. We've got flooring in, stores maybe Graham, you'd like to make a comment. Very early days, customers have to get used to new brands, but do you have a comment about ups and downs of the introductions, Graham?\", 'Graham Bell', \"I think as ever with a new brand there is a timing issue, and I think if I could see the earliest ones we’ve had then has been the GoodHome paint. And of course paint is one of those brands where some customers have a lot of loyalty and getting the changeover. But what we have found especially from our staff and customers that are using the new GoodHome paint, they’re delighted with the quality and the price of the product. So, that's landed really well.\", \"There’s a GoodHome flooring which kind of in the next one so we better move. We're getting a lot of great feedback and starting to see the sales lift with that. And I think the next big one for us probably is going to be GoodHome kitchens which we’re obviously just kicking off at the moment.\", \"So, I think there’s a timing issue but some great feedback from the customers and the staff which I always think is a great measurement and listening to our customers. It's about the quality of the brand as well as some of the sustainable issues that really are coming to the fore.\", \"And predominantly, we've been asked a lot from customers about not just the sustainability of that paint, but also is it suitable for children which is questions that our older generation never used to ask.\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Thanks, Graham. Clearance guidance.', 'Graham Bell', 'Yes on clearance. Yes, I mean, I previously said that we though the clearance should be half one weighted. Primarily associated the implementation of Surfaces & Décor we have in place where I said earlier from £25 million - £30 million to £35 million. We hope that we also expect incremental clearance now in half two associated with B&Q kitchen range. And just to note perhaps on clearance was about 40 bps on sales of £6 billion. So that calculates to around £20 million. So, we’re just building in the incremental from B&Q.', 'Geoff Ruddell', \"It’s Geoff Ruddell here from Morgan Stanley. Can I just take you back to Slide 16 of the presentation which is the gross margin bridge where you have a 30 basis point improvement from price repositioning mainly at Brico Dépôt France. Could you just explain to us exactly what you've done in terms of price repositioning at Brico Dépôt France?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'So we - I’ll take it. I’ll try. You’ll know that, correct me for this one. The main - one of the main features of Brico Dépôt France is we used to run about 16% to 17% of our sales around - [indiscernible] which is imported products which is sold at a deal. That’s one of lots. That has gone down significantly. We’re probably at the four, five level now again.', 'But that whole strategy how much, where is it, we’re just testing the markets to see whether the right probability is that. It’s the reduction because that was typically if we made anything from it wasn’t much. So, it was about taking that away from our sales line and converting that into more profitable sales even though we got an impact on the topline.', 'Geoff Ruddell', 'And if could just ask one more. Obviously, we don’t where we’re going with Brexit at the moment. But if we do end up with the U.K. having a different trade policy to the rest of the EU, are you still going to be able to get the group scale buying benefits you think going forwards because obviously the U.K. has different tariff imports relative to EU tariff imports from either China or whenever else you may be sourcing product from. Could that sort of obviate the whole sort of strategy of buying jointly?', 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Well, we don’t. Well, I mean, we don’t think so. Because we're still be better off than we otherwise would be unless we were buying most of - most of them I think locally which I don’t think we’ll ever be so probably would do that.\", 'Graham Bell', \"Roughly as for intensive sourcing because part of the strategy has been to - on the unified product particular is the source in the filing. So we actually have engineer and we also have been sourcing locally. But to your point, in terms of tariff, that’s typically from Europe. If the government guidelines that we put out which I still reaffirm come thru because we're not actually selling food or pharmaceutical. The products on that list are the ones that we still actually have a zero tariff. That falls into place.\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Depending on how it lands.', 'Graham Bell', 'How it lands.', 'Geoff Lowery', \"Geoff Lowery at Redburn. Can we talk a bit about Screwfix? I think price and Screwfix were sort of co-joined four or five times through the presentation. Should we take out of this that you've been a bit greedy on price in recent years? How far do you need to go? Can you help us quantify in that group gross margin bridge what the Screwfix price component is in half 1 and half 2.\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Do you want to take that John.', 'John Wartig ', \"Yes. I think what we have been, we have been - we are sensitive to the competition. We have actually been addressing. We have put some price realignment in the first half. We do have some up weighted in the second half. But I wouldn't use the term greedy. I think is just recognizing the competitive situation. Our price index now is actually in some categories quite close but sort of 101%-103%. But we're continuing to assess that.\", 'Geoff Lowery', \"Can we talk about transformation cost. You’re obviously taking away one of your three CPT definitions which is totally fine and logical. Should we be adding back £56 million next year as the adjusted number of the non-recurrence of transformation costs or given all that you've got to do? Is this just going to be a permanent feature now?\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'I think part of the logic there is that the transformation costs within P&L transformation. We were trying to expect those costs that were actually a part of the initial establishment of, for example, unified offering. As that’s now coming into play and that continues to work, that is actually generating profitability for the business.', \"So, it would be incorrect for us to actually expect that. So, it is a separate P&L item. So, any associated costs with any ongoing is actually absorbed within the margin generation lookup. So, I wouldn't be adding £60 million to the underlying costs as a consequence.\", 'Tushar Jain', 'This is Tushar from Goldman Sachs. Just on B&Q, it seems the like-for-like has been underperforming with some of the listed tiers? Is there anything apart from range changes and installation issues going in the B&Q that might be impacting the performance there?', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'B&Q in particular?', 'Tushar Jain', 'Yes.', 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Well, we'll ask Graham. And I think those are two we've - three we've called out, Brexit, the installation disruption and kitchens. But any other things you would like to add? We have….\", 'Tushar Jain', \"I'm going to sat on the B&Q, the digital part as well. It’s just only to 10%....\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Yes, new platform in, so.', 'Graham Bell', \"Yes, I think, I mean, obviously, the best, but the economy is something that we're aware of. But I think what we have been doing is really getting a housing order and really getting fit. The installations was a decision we took. I think it was the right decision at the time. We were not technically set up. We didn't have a product range. We were not giving our customers a good service, and we weren't making money out of it.\", \"So, I think it was the right decision for B&Q. And I think what we’ve got to do is get a new kitchen range and get a supply and new logistics properly set up and then maybe look at where we go in installations in the future. But I'd rather get the base elements to get fast, to get really fast and ready to be famous for doing a great service, great product and then build on that.\", \"I think, on digital, as you probably, having come from Screwfix, I've got a great passion and I think the work that I’m doing with John Mewett, we really have a great opportunity to push forward there. As you know, it's all about getting the base elements and the technical fulfillment. And we've got a great opportunity there. I think, in the future, we're making great strides forward on that.\", \"And we have had a lot of disruption this year. We have changed probably over a third of a store which has led to a lot of disruption, we’re just coming through apart from kitchens. We worked hard to keep clearing the stock, as well as getting the new range and really trying to minimize the impact in the customers. And I think we're looking forward to know has really been able to switch that new product and drawing forward a better performance in future.\", 'Tushar Jain', 'One question on unique/unified ranges. Basically it does look like the growth has slowed down in unique/unified ranges. It was growing close to 2% last year, broadly flat just in the first half of this year. Is it all linked to the Castorama issues or how these revenues are being accepted I rest of it.', 'John Wartig', 'Sorry. I missed the question.', 'Tushar Jain', 'So, unique and unified ranges growth was close to 2% last year and is close to broadly flat, 40 basis points up this year. Is there something specific happening in the growth in the unique/unified ranges?', 'John Wartig', 'Not that I’m aware of.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'There’s now issues. I think if any in the growth - as we’ve seen the cost both unified and non-unified, some of the disruptions that we’ve had in France, but in terms of supply chain, some of the competitive issues and some of the disruption within across the business, but it’s not something specific to unified range that’s changed - and the unified store growing versus non-unified.', 'Richard Chamberlain', 'Richard Chamberlain, RBC. Can we just touch on Eastern Europe? I think it looks like the growth in Poland has slowed in the second quarter and then can you just give the reasons for that? And also how much the – in Romania, how much the Praktiker integration contributed to the losses we saw there?', 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Okay. I think in the second quarter there were more some – some comparatives and also some – or is more the comparative quarter on quarter and I wouldn't say we're not seeing as growing. They actually had new store openings in a couple of events taking place in the quarter, which are more stand-alone, but it's not a slowing of the overall business.\", \"In terms of Praktiker, it has pretty challenging. The business is an integrated. They've got a lot – as I said in my presentation, there's a lot of transitional work still taking place and that’ll go into next year as well. It's taking longer and taking more time.\", 'Once they’ve integrated the two businesses and they can actually manage their inventory and everything better, I think their execution will improve, but it still as I said in transition over the next 6 to 12 months. But it has been the drag on earnings in the short-term.', 'Richard Chamberlain', 'Can I just ask a follow-up on Castorama France, the digital of the way you think you are on that journey to improve the customer experience and functionality and such optimization and so on and when you’re going to expect the sales uplift from there?', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'So, our digital upgrades will come out in a series of releases. So, Graham has just been the latest one which actually digs - give us some clunky moments when that was going in the spring. So there was a bit of impact from there.', \"So, that’s now working a lot better, and we’re guessing - if you look at the NPS because we also measure the NPS of our digital customer reaction. And that’s rising. But I would say it’s rising from a low start in both B&Q and Castorama. So, I think, yes, it's better. The sales have been rising in all our business units including Castorama, but it starts from a long way back and there's still a lot we can do.\", \"And I think the next release that we put into B&Q really that we've done this spring I think is scheduled for - I might get this wrong - next spring in Casto, so it will be coming but probably six months now. We have to line everything up with all the other questions we've got today about how do we sequence the change program because there's no doubt that the compound effects of the changes in France have been what really hurt us. So, if you just track the individual activities, you don't actually see the compounding effect till it’s late in the game.\", \"So, I think what we need to do is go back as we said and look at how we're sequencing these change programs so that we're not submerging people continually with more change. So, it's just how we do it. And I think the current forecast is for that - but we’ll review that. But hopefully it will be that because it's fairly discrete work. So, yes, it should improve from there, but a long way to improve, big opportunity.\", 'Adam Cochrane', \"Adam Cochrane, Citi. Can you explain the moving parts of the gross margin guidance of flat for the full year versus up for the first half if you can? And, secondly, I'm trying to rack my brain as you've talked about dual-running costs clearance. What is the source of underlying profitability of the business? How much dual-running cost is sitting in there? How much of your gross margin is being negatively impacted? I can’t quite get feel what it should look like at the end.\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'So two questions, Graham?', 'Graham Bell', 'Yes. I think first on the margin, I think we still have - I think the primary driver there is the ongoing clearance as it would actually weighted our guidance in terms of clearance and the second part is just the ongoing disruption particularly around Castorama France. We don’t expect that to change materially over the short to medium term as we’re sort of working through a number of issues we’re talking about.', 'And then there’s sort of a third element to that, too, is that we don’t expect to get the same level of before clearance and disruption cost because we’ve got the annualization of both the installation and removal in B&Q and also the other values or the price repositioning in France that annualizes the end of Q3.', 'Adam Cochrane', 'It’s less positive coming through over the…', 'Graham Bell', 'Less positive and too many negatives coming through.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Okay. On underlying profitability, we don’t have a calculation on that at this point. It’s large. I think does that help?', 'John Wartig', \"I think it would be fair to say that there’s significant unlock potential in value once we remove a number of date impediment, clearance being normalized or removing the supply chain and logistics issue, getting our fulfillment in place and getting digital in place. We're currently working through our three-year plan analysis at the moment which we’ll be going to with Thierry. And I am sure, that Thierry, you’ll actually have a number of inputs into that. So the business going forward is something we’ll be working to over the next three to six months.\", 'Alasdair McKinnon', 'Alasdair McKinnon, Scottish Investment Trust. Thanks for today’s presentation. Look, I get in several years of paying, unifying everything. What I wonder though was with Thierry’s arrival whether there’s an opportunity to step back a level at the board level and say, is this the right way forward. Is this what the customer wants or is there a way to look at the portfolio of assets and say perhaps different companies want different things. Perhaps it’s a different way of doing. I know that won’t be popular because of the journey we’ve been on but I just wonder what your thoughts and why you think a unified offering across different geographies will work? What can you point to say it works?', 'Andrew Cosslett', \"Well, I think - you know look and it's a great question. As I said at the start of the presentation, Thierry has no handcuffs on. He can come and he can look. We're operating to a business that you know it’s common sense in any business that you make the best of your assets. How have you defined that to be. We definitely want to try and get a return from the investments we’ve made and we think that some of the things we've done are certainly obvious ways to improve the efficiency of the business as it is composed.\", \"I think you know Thierry will come in and take a full view and a good look at everything. And we need to have some priorities of resource allocation. We need to think through that and that's going to be part of the process that we're going to be going through with the Board with Thierry’s aim for over the next few months.\", \"You know there are there are - I think there are evidence points that it's always a balance. This is not an active fate. This is about finding the right pragmatic balance between what you know you can unify and get benefit from where customers are happy with the innovation you bring and the fact that it’s unified is I’m not going to end to that.\", 'It can be unified and it’s the advantage you’ve seen in better pricing and unique attributes to the product. So you improve the product, you drop the price, and it’s a price category - and it’s a product category that is insensitive in terms of customer loyalty.', \"Those exists, we have large amounts of executives like that. Finding the balance between those products and how much local product we have in international again. So, it’s back to this question and we need to continually test and make sure that we are serving our customers and I'm sure Thierry would agree with it with what they want and finding the places where we can get the efficiencies out with no detriment and improvement in customer.\", \"So, it's a balance. And we'll see where we go. But I think Thierry's arrival is opportune. I think it's a good opportunity to get a completely fresh perspective and we'll be back to talk to you about that.\", 'Tony Shiret', 'Tony Shiret from Whitman Howard. Back to the business as it is. You mentioned availability Castorama and I wonder if you could sort of give us some sort of quantification of how bad presumably your availabilities and where you think you can get it to and what you measure with availability.', \"And second point, on the unique offer where you’ve got 150 basis points of gross margin benefit. Is that a net figure? I mean, have you sort of retained all of the benefit or I presume there's some fostering prices where there's - as retention in the gross margin. Can you give us some sort of sense for that?\", 'John Wartig', \"I think the 150 basis points, it is gross. It's the gross and I think we're stretching it out. Anything you see in our margin, we haven't been out to retain all that. There is some CPI and inflation coming through there. We're trying to actually offset but not all of it gets retained and yet again dissipated some of it through supply chain.\", \"As we said to the ways of working now that under the new operating model, we're actually earning more of the supply chain particularly from the Far East that we're not just sourcing from around the corner. So, there are some additional costs that's actually offsetting that.\", 'Tony Shiret', 'So, the 150 basis points is before those costs.', 'John Wartig', 'Great.', 'Tony Shiret', 'Okay.', 'Andrew Cosslett', 'And the availability question?', 'John Wartig', \"The availability I mean - you mean in broad terms, I mean, if you're looking at what is good - or actually you can look around the group, that’s sort of it’s more like a 98%, 99% in terms of fulfillment that's what we should be going for in some cases. And some of it is because things have just fallen over in terms of the DCs that were being sort of sub 95%.\", \"And that's the heart of the issue that we're addressing. And in some cases, it is actually - it’s a disconnecting process is the way we've actually had inventory in location the way we've entered into the system.\", 'Andrew Cosslett', 'Thank you very much.

With us today are the company's Vice President of Sales, Justin Chinn; John Hardwick, Vice President of Construction Services; and Scott Daigle, National Sales Manager.\", \"Following Mr. Chinn, Daigle and Hardwick's remarks, they will take questions from the sell-side analysts. Before the conclusion of the call, I will provide the necessary cautions regarding forward-looking statements made by management during this call.\", \"We'd like to remind everyone that this call is available for replay starting this evening via the link provided in last Wednesday's press release through September 24, 2019, and will also be available on the company's website at investors.rgsenergy.com for the next 12 months.\", \"Now I'd like to turn the call over to the RGS Energy's Vice President of Sales, Mr. Justin Chinn. Please go ahead, sir.\", 'Justin Chinn', \"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss our commercialization strategy for POWERHOUSE and our recent progress towards our goal of achieving break-even and better results. This morning, we posted a business update for the 30-day period since our last conference call on the Investor Relations section of our website. The update also shows figures from previous 30-day periods and includes a few pictures of our recent POWERHOUSE installations for homeowners. It also provides a timeline graphic to chronologically illustrate the sales process with roofers.\", \"Now that we have a few months under our belt of providing POWERHOUSE to homeowners through our roofing and homebuilder partners, we have better insight into the roofer sales process for commercialization of POWERHOUSE. We have two objectives for today's call: one is to talk to you about our recent sales on homeowner installations of POWERHOUSE; and secondly, walk you through the entire process our network participants go through in order to sell and install POWERHOUSE so you can better understand how our sales pipeline and backlog will result in revenue for us.\", \"For some of us it is helpful to see things. With this in mind, we've provided the timeline image that illustrates the sales process from a time a roofer starts to talk to a homeowner, all the way through to us shipping product to the roofer. After I'm done explaining the steps on this timeline to you, I will turn the call over to John Hardwick, who just so happens to be offsite today at an installation in Iowa. He will talk to you about his experiences with homeowners and roofers in the field.\", \"So starting with the sales process graphic, from the viewpoint of our roofers, also known as POWERHOUSE Pros, they start the process with a homeowner not only to replace their roof but to replace it with POWERHOUSE. After a strong level of interest is achieved, or a POWERHOUSE quote has been accepted by the homeowner, the Pros contact my sales team to review the customer's roof, verify preliminary design work and then create a bill of materials. The bill of materials for the project includes all the necessary equipment components. This is the first time the project is shown in our sales pipeline. After the BOM is completed, they must comply with all the red tape of permitting, interconnection and incentive approvals, as well as any homeowner financing needs. These regulatory matters take time and vary by state, but are simply part of the industry and apply to any type of solar installation, whether it’s solar shingles or an old fashioned rack-n-mount system.\", 'As I mentioned on our previous business update call, our roofer and solar EPC pros are not positioned to buy and stock POWERHOUSE, so the pros wait until the job is nearly ready for installation before payment and scheduling of shipment. That means that even if they’ve submitted a signed purchase order, they’re waiting until they’ve received permits as well as interconnection approval with the utilities before payment.', 'Each of these items take time and vary by state, but typically take between 30 to 60 days. Even though we will typically get the purchase order from the roofer shortly after the homeowner signs the contract for the new roof and POWERHOUSE shingles, it will not usually pay us on the order until the job is ready to go.', 'That being said, my sales team has been striving to provide ample forecasting and in that spirit encourage their customers to submit their purchase orders earlier in the construction process, even if they plan to wait to pay and request shipment. We ship solar shingles after we have paid either in full or with an adequate downpayment from the roofer.', 'As manufacturer of POWERHOUSE, we recognize revenue upon shipment of materials related to customer purchase order fulfillment. I hope you see this explanation that there is a lot going on behind the scenes with the homeowner, the roofer and the local jurisdiction before RGS is even involved. This is important context for those wanting to understand how our backlog translates into revenue.', 'We just started the commercialization process, so we’re not fully up and running, but at some point, and we’ve referred to it in the past as being at equilibrium, we will have had the pump primed with enough roofers and orders that we believe we will have consistently higher streams of revenue. With the long sales cycle I described, we simply cannot come out of the gate with revenue fully online.', 'As you know, our timing for receiving UL approval was not ideal as it was right at the start of winter. There are a couple of points to be made here. One, is that most of our roofers started 2019 with a backlog they first had to install before they could sell POWERHOUSE. They simply did not have the bandwidth to take care of commitments to existing customers and then take on more customers with POWERHOUSE. However, more of them have been catching up on their own backlogs and are now pitching POWERHOUSE.', 'Secondly, we are working with our existing roofing network and training them how to better sell POWERHOUSE over the winter. We learned that roofers quickly build a backlog for the spring. We want them to finish the fall strong, but have a head start on POWERHOUSE projects that are ready to build in early 2020.', 'Having POWERHOUSE projects at the top of their backlog will allow the roofers to install POWERHOUSE in earnest during spring, maximizing the homeowner energy output over the summer. We also believe this will lead to repeat business, although not that prevalent yet, we’ve had some repeat business already.', 'Now I will hand the call off to John Hardwick, Vice President of Construction Services, to share his experience and insights from his on-site involvement with some of the recent homeowner POWERHOUSE installations. John?', 'John Hardwick', 'Thanks, Justin. I’d like to start with providing you some background on my history with POWERHOUSE. During my 16 years in solar, I’ve enjoyed a big chunk of that time being a field tech instructor for each and every version of POWERHOUSE Solar Shingles so far dating back almost eight years ago to the early days of Dow. The earlier versions of POWERHOUSE were innovative products, but they used SIG’s technology, which was quite expensive and rather inefficient.', 'RGS upgraded POWERHOUSE to industry-standard silicon technology, offering double the power at an attractive price. Since that upgrade, we’ve seen a growing amount of interest and excitement for POWERHOUSE nationwide. And over the years, I’ve used my deep knowledge how to install POWERHOUSE. So I’d like to take some time and share with you some recent stories from the roof real installs, so you can get an idea of how POWERHOUSE measures up in the mind of our installers and the solar shingle homeowners.', 'Over the last several months, we’ve been installing POWERHOUSE and already we’ve deployed POWERHOUSE in the four major corners of Mainland, USA, from Seattle to Los Angeles, Upstate New York and East Coast of Florida. As we speak, I’m here in Iowa on-site for an installation of a 7.4 kilowatt system. We have many projects to choose from, but I’m going to focus on four projects from those four corners of Mainland U.S. And to see pictures of these projects, please see the business update that we posted today.', 'The first installation story I’d like to share with you was in Seattle. The roofers and the homeowners of this installation loved how well the POWERHOUSE blended with the extremely dark charcoal-colored asphalt shingles. The lead roofer and I adopted a speedier method of preloading screws into the POWERHOUSE parts. So the install went much faster like a NASCAR pit crew tire change. Even though Seattle rains caused some typical delays, we were still able to install the 7 kilowatt system in less than two full work days. I’ve taught this faster method to every crew since and I believe this method will result in a significant reduction in installation time.', 'In New York, the roofers installed the system on a drastically steep roof pitch. Thanks to our suggestion to use specialized scaffolding called Johnny Jacks. The scaffolding allowed safe installation by spanning across the roof between large padded footers that rested securely on top of the PV glass. The roofers also commented on the extreme durability of our solar shingles. For example, when their forklift toppled on uneven ground in the form and dropped 20 solar shingles from five feet up, none of the POWERHOUSE glass shattered nor was it scratched.', 'An interesting part of the story was years ago, the roofer took a week long solar course as he was interested in offering traditional rack-n-mount solar. After the course, he was completely discouraged by the installation complexities of traditional rack-n-mount, and the roofer never thought he would do solar. However, when we finished this job, he was very glad to give POWERHOUSE solar a shot and he said that POWERHOUSE seemed to be specifically designed for him, a roofer. He also commented that it was much more rewarding and cleaner work than traditional roofing jobs.', 'Turning to another project, this one being the first of many POWERHOUSE systems installed in Colorado close to our headquarters, just so happened to be located right next door to another house that had traditional rack-n-mount solar, seeing the two roofs side-by-side clearly showed that the traditional rack-n-mount solar stuck out like a mismatched industrial bolt on, like old braces with headgear, whereas POWERHOUSE looked smooth, elegant, almost hidden like Invisalign. This is one of those classic examples where the husband really wanted solar and the wife demanded solar shingles. In just two days with sunny skies above us, the roofers installed two very large arrays totaling about 10 kilowatts even while being filmed for our show on PBS and they were observed by many people on the ground.', 'Another project I’d like to talk about was completed in Florida just before Hurricane Dorian hit the coast. The homeowners used their POWERHOUSE solar to charge and run their large backup battery system, providing them with power throughout the intermittent blackouts. They were the only ones on the block with uninterrupted power and they used clean, renewable energy to do so. Amazingly, this customer now has one of the largest POWERHOUSE version III solar shingles that we’ve ever put on a single family home. It’s approximately 15 kilowatts, more than double the national average solar system size. We covered six different roof faces, two large and four small arrays that were perfectly matched to the shape of those areas.', \"The entire family was excited and deeply involved in this installation so much so that in the end, with appropriate safety precautions, we brought them all up to the roof for photos. The mom and dad performed the last voltage check, they used an impact driver to install the final system parts and both of their kids celebrated and yelled, “We have the power.” So far, every install has been completed on time and within budget due to proper preplanning, good engineering designs, inventory double-checks and lots of smart work from everyone involved. The guys on the roof here in Iowa, they're ready to get back to it.\", 'So, closing remarks from me. The process with the roofers is going very well and not by accident. The product was designed to be easy for roofers to install. This would apply whether it was an individual local roofer or a roofer installing it as a subcontract for a homebuilder.', \"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott, who will talk more about our efforts with the homebuilders. Scott?\", 'Scott Daigle', 'Thanks, John. Today, I will give an update on our sales strategy and where we will be concentrating our effort over the next few months. We are finding homebuilders to be a very desirable customer segment for us. After all, they will order more than one home at a time. Our focus has been on medium-sized builders developing neighborhood of approximately 50 to 150 homes. We found the upfront development time tends to be shorter with them allowing us to get to purchase orders faster.', \"We are currently in discussion with 21 homebuilders throughout the country. The feedback has been very positive. These discussions follow a similar pattern. We first introduce POWERHOUSE to the builder. Most of the homebuilders share with us their neighborhood layout, home designs, and their built-out schedule. Most of the communities take at least six months of planning and then the building begins. Depending on the size of the community, to fully complete the build-out, it may take up to six months to a year. There are also some situations with prefab homes and smaller custom homebuilders where we believe this timeline will be shorter. As we develop the relationships with the homebuilders, we're also being introduced to their subcontracting roofers. These introductions allow us to showcase POWERHOUSE to their roofing network with the backing of the homebuilder. We believe these relationships will have a dual benefit.\", \"First, we are working with roofers the homebuilders are comfortable with, thereby increasing the chance POWERHOUSE will be chosen for neighborhood. Second, as we train the roofing subcontractors, it allows these roofers to bid on projects with other homebuilders or homeowners they work with outside of RGS' established network. A roofer with a track record working with homebuilders and can offer and install POWERHOUSE will differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack. We believe this to be a win-win for everyone.\", 'Last month, we announced joining builder partnerships and manufacturing network of over 1,400 homebuilders. We are in the early stages of the relationship, but we are very excited about our membership in this homebuilder network, because we believe it will enable us to garner more homebuilder POWERHOUSE customers at a faster pace.', 'The next area of focus is building an ever stronger installation network across California to meet the anticipated demand from the upcoming 2020 mandate. California has rigorous licenses requirements, and having electrical roofing and solar licenses within one organization offers the best solution in California. We are striving to develop relationships with organizations that can offer a turnkey solution, selling, installing POWERHOUSE separating themselves from the other installers in a saturated solar market.', 'As Justin mentioned early in the call, we’re also working with our roofing network to fill their backlogs now for installations through the upcoming winter and into the spring. Strategically, of course, we’re putting concentrated effort into building our network of participants in warmer climates where roofing continues year-round. Our efforts have expanded our network from 262 at April 15 to 335 today. As we look ahead, we will continue to increase the number of participants and the rate of participation within our network.', 'I will now pass the conversation back to Justin to wrap up.', 'Justin Chinn', 'Thanks, Scott. We’ve recently begun receiving repeat business from a few of our pros and we view that as a great milestone towards our goal of growing our sales channels. Scott and I are proud we’ve managed to build up a sizable backlog in a matter of months. While pleased, we also know that we’re not fully up and running quite yet, as can be expected having started just several months ago.', 'We believe our current sales and training processes have worked well for creating the backlog, but it takes time to get the revenue from that backlog because of all the hoops our customers must jump through in order to build the project. We use the term flywheel internally when we discuss what it will look like when we’re fully up and running, meaning projects exit the backlog while new ones are coming in each month. We believe we’re building momentum in the POWERHOUSE flywheel.', 'Thank you again for joining us on today’s call. We will update you again in 30 days.

(NASDAQ:UNIT) Goldman Sachs 28th Annual Communacopia Conference September 18, 2019  9:40 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Kenny Gunderman - CEO', 'Mark Wallace - EVP, CFO & Treasurer', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs', 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Brett, it’s good to be here, thanks for having us as always.', 'Brett Feldman', \"Hi, so we will jump into it. If we go back to your second quarter call, you’ve outlined three key priorities for Uniti. You have discussed leasing up your shared infrastructure assets, including your fiber and tower assets. You talked about deploying capital in accretive ways, including sale leaseback opportunities. And you talked about navigating Windstream bankruptcy process while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Let's start with your fiber business. As of the second quarter, your fiber business generated over 30% of your consolidated revenue, about 18% of your EBITDA. You have I believe, seven major dark fiber projects and seven small cell projects under construction, many of which should be completed reasonably soon. And so I guess the question would be how are you thinking about the long-term lease-up potential for the infrastructure projects you're deploying right now?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, so I think you characterized everything exactly right, including our priorities and I'm happy to hit on any of those but with respect to the fiber business, very pleased with how those projects are progressing. And ultimately to conclusions most of them will be done this year and a few will leak into next year. But as we've always said, for those projects, for the economics to really make sense, you've got to lease-up in addition to just the anchor customer. So right now we're building for anchor customers. These are all wireless projects. We're building for the big, big pool of wireless carriers in existing markets in the Southeast.\", \"And in order to really drive the economics you need to have enterprise and schools and wholesale lease-up on top of that. And so several quarters ago, we started talking really about the progress there. And we've had several quarters now of bookings and installs being dominated by non-wireless. So if you look at bookings, the percentage of bookings has been growing in terms of non-wireless, the percentage of installs has been growing as a percentage of non-wireless, and those are leading indicators of leasing up those networks.\", \"So we started that several quarters ago, actually started that more than several quarters ago, we started talking about it several quarters ago. And that's exactly what you're going to continue to see. So as we're rolling those new networks into the portfolio, we’re progressively adding more and more of that non-wireless lease-up on top of those networks. So we’ve been very pleased with that, with that progress and those trends.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'How do you think about that converting into a long-term growth rate for your fiber business because you set some targets? I think you talked about 8% to 12% being what you view as a growth rate for your fiber assets over the long-term that is better than what some of your peers are achieving right now. How do you think about the differentiation of your assets versus maybe some of the other companies we comp you against and what you need to do from sales execution standpoint to live up to those objectives?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"We're really, we've talked about this from the beginning, but we love our markets. We’ve consciously focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. So demographically, there's just less competition in those markets. There's certainly less competition from national fiber providers like Uniti. So you tend to see, regional HI-LEX, regional cable companies is competition. So we'd like the competitive dynamic. Our markets in the Southeast are growing, so demographically, they're growing new business is coming in, there's a lot of government and military opportunities in those markets. So we like the competitive dynamic. We like the demographics.\", \"And when you look at the growth of all of our businesses, dark fiber, small cells, enterprise, wholesale, schools, government they’re all growing, all of those businesses are growing and so and when you look at our churn, our churn rates are below market churn, so we have a favorable churn. So all of those things are just great tailwinds for us in our markets. And really our governor on growth is just installs, our ability to install things in a timely fashion on schedule. And obviously, that's a struggle for us in the same way it is for a lot of other fiber companies because there are many things there that are outside of your control that I'm sure we might talk about some of those today.\", \"But ultimately, I would much rather that be the governor on our growth than things like demand or demographics or competition. So all that to say, we love our markets. We like the competitive dynamic, and we think we're in the right region of the country. And so I think we're going to continue to execute on our plan, I think you'll continue to see good growth.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"We will stick with things that are in your control for right now, we'll get to some other things soon. I want to hear a little bit more about how you’re thinking about growth, growth versus investment. So the projects that you have in the market right now obviously requiring a significant amount of capital, I think on the net basis announced that over 40% of your revenue which is a fairly high level of capital intensity, how long do you think you're going to have to invest that level of capital? And how do you think about getting to the point where existing fiber assets play a larger role in your incremental bookings than lease-up?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"I think so that's a great question. So I think we're already at a point where existing fiber assets are dominating the lease-up because several of the companies that we acquired to build Uniti Fiber already had existing assets, a lot of existing assets in those markets. So dense metro, metro fiber, which is very important.\", \"But these new projects are ones that get us into new markets. They're an anchor opportunity to get into a new market with a Greenfield build, that gives us a defensible network for many years to come because once you're in that market, especially in a Tier 2 market, you definitely dissuade competitors from coming into those markets in the future. So the capital question is, it's important not in the sense that there aren't more of those opportunities, it's important in the sense that there's probably more of those opportunities than we want to pursue because we want to moderate capital.\", \"And balance it in a way where we're constantly getting into new markets. And we're keeping competitors out of the market but at the same time, leasing up those networks. So it's a balance that we've said and as you've alluded to, we do plan for that capital intensity to come down over time, many of these big projects that we're currently finishing were projects that we inherited from acquisitions.\", \"And so in fact, all of them are projects that we acquired from acquisitions. So I think in the future, you'll see us continue to pursue larger projects but just not eight or 10 at the same time.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"You did mention earlier that non-wireless really is dominating the funnel right now, but small cells I imagine are still part of what's driving demand. And I was hoping you can just give us a little more insight into that, how competitive is it to win these projects? How many of them are there out there, is it a real source of growth for the business?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, it's definitely, so small cells in the Tier 2 and 3 markets don't dominate in the same way they do in the Tier 1 markets yet. And I think yet is the operative word because we definitely see it coming. And one of the reasons that we want to be building some of these Greenfield networks to get us into some of these markets is because we want to be positioned for those small cells when they come two, three years from now because they are coming to Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets in a bigger way, and when that happens, we will be very well positioned for it. But right now, we are building small cells, there’s a nice healthy funnel of more small cells coming really from all the carriers in the markets. And so we sort of we view those as anchor builds in the same way as we do traditional dark fiber because in effect is dark fiber for the most part some are cells [perform] [ph], some are just the fiber.\", \"But there's a very healthy funnel economics are in that 5% to 7% initial yield range that we've already talked about. And then there's great lease-up potential on top of that. So good funnel but really the big small cell opportunity in our markets just two or three years from now, we're going to be well positioned for it when it happens.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Last question on this, Crown Castle reduced its estimate for small cell deployments this year citing permitting delays, so it wasn't the funnel that they had, but their ability to deploy more at a local level. What are you seeing on the ground? Are you finding that municipalities are willing to work with you or is just a real issue for the industry?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, it's a real issue for sure. So I didn't see Crown’s comments but I know from our perspective, we've always talked about 12 to 24 months to deploy small cells start to finish. And back to my earlier comments. The governor on the ability to deploy is not the demand, it’s not the construction itself, it is permitting. And in a lot of cases, you're dealing with municipalities and especially in our case, you're dealing with municipalities who have never dealt with small cells before they don't have a small cell ordinance. They don't know what a small cell is until there's an education process and there's a relationship development process. So it just takes time.\", \"And I think for us when you look at our large projects, and we've had install delays in the past that have impacted our numbers, they've all been related to permitting. But I will say that I think that although there haven't been any dramatic improvements eventually that will improve because getting into these markets and educating the municipalities for the first time, you only have to do that once. And the next time you come back, there's an ordinance in place and there's a relationship there. So it will improve. And I think again, when you look two, three years out when I think also come to our markets in a big way, I think the permitting process will be materially better at that point.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Okay. I do want to ask you some questions about Windstream. And also, we're going to try to leave some time for some questions from the audience in general. So if you think you might have a question, I'll come back in a few minutes and ask, you just raise your hand and I will bring the microphone.\", 'You recently entered into mediation with Windstream to resolve some of the disagreements you have regarding the master leases, they go through their bankruptcy process. Can you give us any update in all where you stand in it?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, so obviously Windstream dominates the headlines for us and has for the past two year or so two years. We are in mediation; part of what we've agreed with Windstream is to minimize our public comments about it. So I’m limited in what I can say. But I will say, we were not surprised about mediation, it was sort of what we expected. Our relationship with Windstream is very complicated and sizable for both companies.\", \"And there are a lot of interested constituents on the Windstream front given all the different creditor groups. So it's complicated. There's a lot of interested constituents. And so mediation is sort of a natural conclusion of all - trying to get all these parties on the same page. So we were very willing, participants agreeable to that. And I'd say we've been very pleased with the progress. It's arduous, but we're pleased with the progress and we're pleased that all the parties are working constructively towards a mutual beneficial outcome.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"And you said before you're looking for somebody, it's mutually beneficial. On your side of that, is there any way you can frame for us what are the components of an outcome that would allow you to move forward because you're probably going to - the relationships inevitably going to have some change to it. There is going to be give and a take, that's what a mutually beneficial outcome would have. I mean, is it cost of capital? Is it revenue certainty? How are you thinking through the boxes that matter to Uniti?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, there's a few and we've actually made a lot of public comments about this in the past different things that we would and would not do. And so I would start by saying, we'd stand by all those past comments and actually believe those comments are true and playing out in mediation I would say. But secondly I think people have always, people tend to think about this as an us versus them negotiation, but we've always framed it as we're a large landlord to Windstream, we're very strategic partner to Windstream and there are a lot of moving parts to our relationship that allow us to help Windstream in ways that don't have to hurt Uniti.\", \"And I think part of the mediation process has been our ability to help educate different creditor groups on what that means. And we've been pleased with that progress. And so there are ways that we can help the Windstream state, that we can help Windstream be a better tenant on the other side of bankruptcy which is important to us but at the same time, help advance our strategic goals as well. And I think that's that's what we're, that's what we're working towards. \", 'Brett Feldman', \"One of the things you have probably discussed in the past is the element of the exclusivity provisions. They are the only tenant that has allowed to use that network infrastructure, even though some of it is lying idle or not fully being taken advantage of. And you've discussed that that might have value to you, if you had the ability to take infrastructure they don't need and to make it available to other customers. That's a great mutually beneficial outcome. Can you give us your updated view on what you think the demand profile for that component of their network would be? And if you had the opportunity to open it up to new customers, how quickly do you think you would capitalize on that opportunity?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, I would say we still believe that's an opportunity. And we continue to focus on that and develop that opportunity. And so rather than give specifics on that, at this point I would just leave it at that.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Okay. I’m going to check now, if anyone does have a question. Right, I'll check again later. Okay, so you've managed to do some things that help your balance sheet over the last few months. You’ve extended the revolver, you've issued some exchangeable notes. What are your priorities right now and how you think about managing the maturity profile?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, so we're definitely still focused on the balance sheet. But the work we did earlier this year pushed out maturities. And I think from a near-term maturity perspective, we feel good, definitely feel good about liquidity. As you mentioned, that was a focus of ours. We've also continued to execute, I think on our ability to invest in the business uninterrupted.\", \"So investing in our fiber and tower and leasing business. So that's all part of our liquidity work, obviously. And we also continue to focus on just optimizing the portfolio of assets. Now we've sold Latin American towers, we've sold our ground lease business. And we've sold the operations of Uniti Fiber in the Midwest all of which were sold at premium multiples which lock in great returns for our shareholders, it validates our strategy and also helps liquidity.\", \"So we're going to continue to look at things like that, as all of those things relate to the balance sheet. But I think we feel good about where we sit.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"You’re currently about six turns of leverage. We don't know what the outcome of the process of Windstream is going to be, but it certainly would create an opening to maybe think about what you want your capital structure to look like? And what do you think is the right cap structure for your business based on the growth profile, the capital intensity of your core fiber businesses, and your ambitions in the M&A market?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Yes, so we’re looking at all those things. Now obviously in this low that we had because the Windstream bankruptcy has afforded us the ability to focus on the strategy and a lot of things that we do every day, but this has just given us more time to prioritize it and nothing new on what our leverage targets are kind of in that five and half to six times range, which is where we are.', \"But we definitely want to position our balance sheet, post-bankruptcy and post resolution of our mediation to set us up for more M&A. We're business, we're growing organically, we like the growth profile of Uniti Fiber, we like the growth profile of towers, and Uniti Leasing. And those things are going to continue. And we're going to continue investing in those businesses. But what really moves the needle for us and moves the needle and what shareholder value is through M&A, and that's acquisitions of companies but really more likely acquisitions of portfolios of assets, particularly on the fiber side really looking at more sale leasebacks that grow that accretive leasing business.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Yes, so let's just talk about your M&A ambitions. The target you sort of had originally was you want to get to 50% revenue diversification. So 50% not coming from Windstream, is that still the way you're thinking about that the first thing you're trying to accomplish? Are you evolving what you're looking to get to?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"No, that still go. I think when the bankruptcy concludes, Windstream will be a better tenant. And so just based on that alone, there may be less, less of a sense of urgency for diversification. But that's really not how we think about it, we want to diversify not just for the sake of diversification but because M&A and growth in the business is a good way to create shareholder value.\", \"So we're very focused on it. And obviously 50% is just a good next target. But ultimately, that's not what we want to end up. We want to get continue to grow our business and eventually Windstream will be a much smaller part of our business. And by the way I think, I think there will be more tools in the kit, post-emergence to help facilitate that. And I look forward to talking about some of those in the future.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'Is EBITDA diversification an element of what you think about as well?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes absolutely and cash flow diversification. So and that's one of the reasons why even before Windstream filed for Chapter 11, that you've seen us focus more on the leasing business because as you know that that business is very, very high margin 90% plus EBITDA margin business with little to no CapEx. So it's a cash flow accretive business. And so that has been a focus and will continue to be a focus going forward.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'And you started to look at or implement OpCo/PropCo structures as element of growing the leasing business through M&A, the most recent was your acquisition of the Uber Fiber network, which you did in conjunction with Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, so you’re the PropCo there, you’re the OpCo. Can you walk us through your thoughts around the structure, what you like about it, what you think the opportunity could be to use it more frequently particularly once you have the Windstream process behind you and whether you think Macquarie is a partner, you could do more of this one?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, Macquarie is a great partner. And we definitely look to do more with Macquarie and Bluebird in particular and in fact, that was part of the original model, it was that there would be more follow-on opportunities with just Bluebird and Macquarie. And we're already seeing that. And I think there'll be more, more to talk about in the near future there. But we love the structure because really, what we're doing is we're replacing our Uniti Fiber operations in the Midwest, with just owning the fiber network of the Uniti Fiber Midwest and the fiber network of Bluebird. So that's really replacing operations and non-readable income with readable income by owning the network.\", \"And it's a wonderful opportunity for us to get more business into Uniti Leasing with high margin, low CapEx associated with it. But it's also a great opportunity for us to participate in M&A in the fiber industry without paying the really, really high multiples that you've seen some of the private companies, private investment funds paying. So it's a great opportunity to drive business into that and participate in acquisitions, companies at premium multiples, we're not paying the premium multiple. So we absolutely want to do more of those. And I think you'll see more of those in the future.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'It certainly seems more core to the original D&A of the business, which actually rise an interesting question about the role of your fiber business inside of Uniti. If you have an additional capital dollar to spend at this point in time, if you always be looking at something inside the leasing business before you thought you have the point inside the fiber business?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"As a general matter, yes. But one of the things you can't forget about Uniti Fiber is that it creates great optionality for us. In fact, the Bluebird deal, I think was helped facilitated by the fact that we owned network in the Midwest through Uniti Fiber, and we're able to monetize those operations to help facilitate that deal. So part of what Uniti Fiber is doing is every day they're creating more Uniti leasing opportunities, not just through these dark fiber projects which by the way are readable, right.\", \"So you will eventually see us move that into the REIT. But then there are also opportunities to monetize operations like we did in the Midwest in a value accretive way. So it's as we've always talked about it, it's a feeder platform in for business to move into the REIT and I think it's working very well for us.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'And you think Macquarie could be a partner and helping them continue to move some of your fiber operations into your leasing operations?', 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Absolutely yes, we had others by themselves.', 'Brett Feldman', \"So when you think about the leasing business, what once you have a property, as you pointed out, it's not capital intensive at all. It's all very upfront. And so how do you think about funding the business in a way such that you are positioned to make those large outlays whether it's through an acquisition or through anything else you see in the market right now? I mean can you talk about this will be for out getting the cap structure in a position that lets you do these deals is key. So what do you think is key to getting a deal? Is it the immediacy of liquidity? Is it the ability to give a seller different types of equity structures. I’m just trying to think through how you think about the benefit as well?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Well what first of all, our M&A pipeline has always been 90% plus proprietary, meaning that we're in bilateral negotiations with counter parties. So we're not really competing to buy assets with other strategic buyers or even financial buyers as a general matter, which gives us the ability to manage timelines and also to structure deals in a way that are mutually beneficial for both us and the seller.\", \"And with respect to how that interplays with the balance sheet, we've always every certainly every large transaction that we've done, we financed in the public markets. So we're not financing our transactions necessarily with cash flow, it's really financing in the public markets which is important because we need to be able to communicate clearly to our shareholders, the strategic rationale of transactions in order to finance deals in a value accretive way.\", \"One of the reasons we've pressed pause on larger transactions during this time of volatility is we're not confident enough that we can execute on larger transactions and be able to communicate the strategic merits of the transaction with all the backdrop of the bankruptcy. So with that said, one of the things we're really looking forward to is having the bankruptcy behind us having the mediation conclude and then get back to more sizable M&A where we can effectively finance transactions in the public markets.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'How much appetite out there, do you think there is to do more of these OpCo/PropCo or leasing oriented structure?', 'Kenny Gunderman', \"I think there's a lot of appetite.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"And so if this the traction wasn't there, if you had more visibility on a permanent cost of capital, your senses, there's indeed a large funnel that you think you could start executing again?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Absolutely, yes.', 'Brett Feldman', 'How long do you think you would take to be in a position to start doing that?', 'Kenny Gunderman', 'We always, I think soon. We’re doing that.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Brett Feldman', \"I'll do last call for questions from the audience. Do you still have U.S. Tower business, you've sold some of your international assets. And we've heard some fairly upbeat things at this conference about the demand for towers. And so I was hoping maybe you can just give us your view, how do you feel about the positioning of your U.S. Tower portfolio? And how does it kind of fit into your infrastructure strategy?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, it’s a great, well first of all, we've always said, we're not a tower company, we're an infrastructure company focused on fiber first, and we happen to think towers are a great add on to that business. So we take a portfolio approach with our carrier customers. And in order to enable the next generation of networks, they need fiber, they need small cells, and they need macro towers.\", \"And we're able to provide all three of those, and we're one of the few companies that can do that. So the tower business is an important component of that toolkit, when we're dealing with the big carriers, including some of the new carriers coming on the scene. And I would say that, we've been very pleased with the amount of demand that we've seen there, not only in terms of developing new towers but also the lease-up that we're seeing on our existing portfolio.\", \"So we’re very pleased with that. And the focus on towers has I think bled into a tremendous amount of private market interest in towers. And you look at valuations for those for tower portfolios. They're 30 times plus cash flow. So and we probably no surprise, we've had a lot of interest expressed in our portfolio from some of these private capital sources. So it validates our strategy, it certainly validates the returns that we expect in that business. So we constantly evaluate that, but it's an important part of our strategy right now.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Talk more about private capital because that's an emerging theme in this sector. We've seen some of the public data center operators go form joint ventures where the funding partner is a private source of capital because the cost of capital in the private market is lower than what they're getting in the public market and off the capital fairly well in the public market. So you're getting very attractive terms other than selling off tower portfolio to a private buyer is that came along. Are there other ways you think you can be partnered with private capital providers particularly once you have the Windstream process behind you?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Definitely, we've and we've talked about this. But so if you look at private market multiples on towers and fiber, they're substantially higher than how they're valued in the public market. And I think one of the things about the Uniti story that that is under appreciated is that we've accumulated a sizable portfolio of fiber, towers and small cells largely through proprietary transactions.\", \"So we haven't, we haven't, we haven't had to pay those enormous multiples to accumulate this really valuable portfolio real estate in a short, very short period of time. But we now have this sort of value arbitrage between what we've accumulated versus what at least the private market is placing on this portfolio.\", \"So that differential creates a lot of opportunity because there is a lot of external capital, private capital, non-traditional sources of capital that are constantly pinging us with opportunities and ideas particularly given that we're actively engaged in the M&A market already.\", \"So there's just a lot of idea flow. And I think for us, we’re proud of the fact that we monetize some of our assets at very high multiples already. And we're constantly focused on ways of optimizing the current portfolio through the lens of what's best for our shareholders.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"All right. So my last question here is on your dividends, you had paid previously last year about $400 million in dividends. That was, I think, in excess of your free cash flow. So the idea was to be very REIT like and to distribute what you couldn't fund what you needed to grow. In the wake of the Windstream bankruptcy, you adjusted it down to approximately $180 million which was simultaneously the minimum you need to pay out and the maximum you're allowed to payout under different structures.\", \"And so it wasn't really something you selected, it was almost selected for you. And so the question here is, obviously, once you have the Windstream process in your rear view mirror, what do you think the role of a dividend is in your shareholder return considering your growth and your M&A ambition?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Yes, I think the way you characterize it is exactly right, in terms of why the dividend is where it is today. And I would just say once we have resolution on mediation and the discussions there and a lot of this volatility is behind us, we’ll get back to a more normalized dividend level and the dividend and I think more directly to your question, it will continue to be a very important part of our story.', 'Brett Feldman', \"I significantly found it was before, do you think there's a balance considering your growth numbers?\", 'Kenny Gunderman', \"Yes, I think there will definitely be a balance and with respect to the sizing of that dividend, that's obviously a board level discussion. So we'll have to resolve that when the time comes.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'Okay, thanks for being here.', 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Yes, thank you.', 'Brett Feldman', 'All right, good luck for the rest of the year.', 'Kenny Gunderman', 'Yes, thanks. It’s great. So appreciate. Good luck.'], ['Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Goldman Sachs 28th Annual Communacopia Conference September 18, 2019  8:00 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Brian Roberts - Chairman, CEO and President', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs Group ', 'Brett Feldman', '[Abrupt Start]', '…to the 28th Communacopia Conference. I’m Brett Feldman, Goldman’s U.S. Telecom and Cable Analyst. Our opening keynote speaker today is Brian Roberts, the Chairman and CEO of Comcast. As many of you know, Brian literally grew up in the company which was founded by his father Ralph Roberts. Brian became President of Comcast in 1990 and since then he has seen its revenues grow from less than $700 million to $110 billion making it one of the largest media and communications companies in the world.', 'In addition to this being our opening keynote today, this session is also being filmed as an episode of GS Talks. So Brianwelcome back to Communacopia.', 'Brian Roberts', \"Great to be here, I think I was at the very first Communacopia and it's a great concept as we watch the industry evolve all these years. So thanks for having me.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Brett Feldman', \"All right. So here is my first question, a few weeks ago we published a report and we pointed out in that report that among your large cap peers which is a group of over 50 companies as we defined it, you trade at one of the lowest earnings multiples despite having an outlook for almost the fastest earnings growth and there's no other company in that list where there was such a significant disconnect between valuation and growth. So my question is, why do you think that disconnect exists? What do you think the markets missing about the Comcast story?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, first of all, I read the report. And I had never seen that thesis presented that, that way. And so as I look back at sort of Comcast historically, there will be times when the stock is up and the stock is down relative to some of our peers, but what I focused first on is, what's our growth? What are our investment opportunities? And can we sustain and therefore hopefully improve that ratio? And I really believe we can.\", 'You know, as I look at the company right now, I think our people are leading in the industry that various businesses are running. And I think our assets are pretty unique. So let me maybe start with just why do I feel that way? Why might we would be able to continue to have that faster growth than perhaps what the multiple would suggest.', \"So there's probably three in our space, three big mega trends. One is broadband. One is, that's happening globally, all these trends are happening globally. Broadband, direct-to-consumer and advanced advertising. And I think we are the leader in broadband, and video, whether it's direct-to-consumer or by whatever means, I think yesterday's announcement with Peacock, we will talk I'm sure a little bit about that, which brings in advanced advertising.\", \"We have 55 million customer relationships now in four major geographies. That puts us in a position to have 200 million addressable homes that we can serve. So we're 55 million and growing with an average of $110 ARPU.\", 'So tremendous scale. In 2018, we spent $24 billion investing in content. And that does not include Comcast Cable or Sky purchasing cable channels. This is content that we make or procure as out of our content divisions.', \"And so if I break - look into those three growth areas, where do I see for Comcast? Well, in broadband, let me start and say that we're having a great third quarter. And we've continued for now, this will be the 14th straight year where we will easily surpass a million net ads, in broadband. And I brought a little demo later to talk about why I think our leadership in broadband is sustainable.\", \"And in the other businesses, as I look at Europe, and I look at Sky’s ability with their incredible brand to offer new products, additional products and different forms of the product to their customers, we’re really pleased with Sky's position. In the Theme Park business, we're building a incredible, fully brand new Theme Park in Beijing with partners that I think will be the best in the world.\", \"At the same time, we're adding a new attraction in Osaka. That's pretty incredible investment and technological investment with Nintendo, Super Nintendo World. And we just announced in Theme Park business that we're going to launch a 4th GATE, entirely new park Universal’s Epic Universe, that will take several years to build.\", \"So Parks has a growth runway. And then with OTT and direct-to-consumer, you have in Sky Now TV. In cable, we have something called Flex, which I'm going to demo. And then yesterday's announcement with Peacock, so we have growth in this - in that world, which is based on advanced advertising.\", \"So I look at all that and say, I think we can continue the model that my dad did start, which is invest in the future, but take care of business in the present. And while you're investing, it doesn't retard your ability to grow. But you're building for future growth. And if I look at the last 10 years and go with the metric that you looked at earnings per share, which is again somewhat different than others have used, we've grown double-digits EPS nine in the last 10 years, and the 10th year was pretty close. So thank you for the thesis and I feel confident about our company at this moment in time. It's really exciting.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Let's get into some of those growth drivers. And I'd like to start with direct-to-consumer video. So as you disclosed yesterday, you're going to call your direct-to-consumer video service Peacock, this is going to be predominantly an ad driven service, meaning it's going to be free to most consumers, which is a bit different than what some of your peers have done where they've decided to go with a subscription model. So why did you decide you wanted to come to market leading with an ad model versus a subscription model?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, I think we're pretty excited about Peacock for the following reasons. One, we think we can use the relationships that we have in the - with so many 10s and 10s and 10s, 75, 80 million customers just in the U.S. And in some cases more that buy our cable channels, and see them we have relationships with consumers can we extend with distributors, we find a way to have Flex, I'm sorry, Peacock be available to those customers.\", \"And if you do so then there's no cost to the customer. And if you do that advertising, a light \", \"ad load with the premium content that will be on this network will be unlike any advertising inventory available that is advanced digital ads with the kind of content you're talking the office, and Parks and Recreation, and remakes of some of the most iconic shows in SNL and possibly Olympics.\", \"So we looked at it and said, let's do something different than the very increasingly crowded field as has been written. And what is our fastest way to get to profitability and do so with the least amount of investment and parlaying on top of the existing relationships that we've got, we think is one way to do that.\", \"So we think we're pretty excited about how the whole company has come together to make this possible. One of the ways we're going to be able to grow so quickly, is we've drawn on the expertise of Sky, send over top two leaders of Now TV, which was really the first direct-to-consumer service in Europe. And they're now along with Bonnie Hammer running Peacock but the whole company is including Comcast Cable and Sky are all engaged in the conversation to how to get this to as many people as quickly as possible and with a very light ad load, we think we'll be able to have a business model that I think all of you will enjoy.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'Can we spend a little more time and the path to profitability as you just talked about it, if we look at some of your other large media peers who have announced their own plans for direct-to-consumer video, a few of them have disclosed meaningful upfront costs such as forgone licensing revenues as they pull back that content from what had been third-party distribution. And so the questions, I would have for you is sort of two parts is first, should we be expecting a type of meaningful financial impact on the NBCU income statement next year for a similar reason and by extension of that, do you need to materially ramp your investment in content either through developing yourself or perhaps going into the market through your M&A program?', 'Brian Roberts', \"So we're not going to give you the answer to the first question, right, today. We will have but we're not planning to launch till second quarter of next year, So, or thereabouts, so we will have plenty of time to come and show you investors and we'll break it out separately and everything else.\", \"But the second answer, and a bit of the first question, I don't believe it's going to materially affect Comcast and in our ability to grow. And that's what I was alluding to earlier. I think that we can make this investment, I think this investment can be significant but not in a way that's going to retard both NBC and overall company from the historic kind of growth that we've been able to enjoy.\", \"And one of the ways we can do that is the second question. We spend $24 billion a year or even more now, and we can repurpose some of that spending to and a good example of that is, is take a recent win which was Chernobyl, that's a Sky production. And we partnered with HBO here in the U.S., but Sky originated that that concept that is European driven.\", \"And so we've been looking at Sky’s success, and Universal Cable productions and NBC Studios. And we said, okay, we've got to ramp up more of our own productions. So in the case of Sky, we launched Sky Studios, and we're going to repurpose some of the spending that Sky is making and do more productions in Sky Studios.\", \"And then those Sky Studios productions, some of those will end up on Peacock. So it's the new Comcast has a capability it never had before. And I think it will work well with the timing of what we think is going to be a really exciting new project, which is Peacock.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'All right. So before we move past NBCU, I would like to spend just a little bit of time talking about film, 2019 has probably been a relatively softer year for that segment prior - versus the prior two years, which were quite good. But if we look at the film slate over the next two years, you have releases from some of your key franchises coming up like Fast & Furious and Jurassic Park and Minions. And so the first question here would be what is your general outlook for the film business and I think the way the investors want to think about it is, what do you have to get right for this to sustainably contribute at least $1 billion a year of EBITDA to the business?', 'Brian Roberts', 'Well, without getting into super specific numbers here. Today, let me say that we take an approach that is a strategic slate, we try to have a mix of the kind of films sometimes sequels are more in one year, less than another year. First half of this year was pretty, pretty strong.', 'We saw some softness in the summer.', \"So I think for this year, we're thinking will be about the same slightly ahead for the full-year on what we did last year, as I looked at 2020, I see three animated sequels, we've got Trolls 2, Croods 2, Minions 2 those won't be the names per se. But those tend to be the more profitable films and people know the content. That's why we bought DreamWorks Animation.\", \"You mentioned the Jurassic and Fast, which will we have a Fast next year. So we're pretty optimistic, but it's also continuing to build this kind of content that is available throughout the whole company, and including the streaming service, but also to Theme Parks and for the cable channels.\", \"So we're, we're thrilled with the film team, Donna Langley is doing a super job, we have Jeff Shell now has a broader portfolio. But we've had a great track record. And I think Disney's done a terrific job and is, but after that, I think Universal is coming second the last several years.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"So when we’re looking at the film business, it's not just looking at that EBITDA contribution on that portion of your reported results. It's looking at how the Theme Parks is leveraging it increasingly, how your direct-to-consumer video product is going to differentiate based on that library?\", 'Brian Roberts', 'The biggest attraction this year in California in Theme Park is Jurassic, we totally redo fantastic ride out in California absolutely and films always punched over its weight. So yes, every years EBITDA matters, but not quite the same because of the impact that it has throughout the rest of our company and our ecosystem.', 'Brett Feldman', \"All right. So let's move on and talk about your cable communications business. And I would like to start with broadband. As you noted, this is going to be, I believe the 14th consecutive year where you've exceeded a million broadband net ads based on the guidance that you've given to us. But when we look at the market, what we see is that you are approaching 50% penetration about half the households and your footprint now by your broadband product. \", 'And we see I guess, emerging gigabit capable services out there maybe 5G is on the horizon. ', \"We've already seen a little bit of fiber overbuilding. What is Comcast strategy for remaining differentiated and sustaining growth in broadband subscribers and average revenue per user as competition increases and as the traditional bundle breaks down?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, I think we pivoted the whole way we're managing the company to focus on that question. And we're so fortunate that we've been able to find ways to have our cable network for low capital investment compared to starting from scratch, some of the ideas that people that are trying to build new networks. There's been nothing like in my lifetime that what's what broadband meant to our company, so much so that we've, we've pivoted to this is the first place to start.\", \"And so if I might, let me pull up a slide to show what's the strategy of broadband and where might that strategy go? So as you said, we’ve increased speeds and we have a gigabit of speed, we increased speeds 17 times in the last 18 years since we launched the product.\", \"And I think that’s powered our usage as consumers changed our society and that's a big part of why I was able to say in the beginning that we're having a great year and we're having, particularly a great third quarter. If you go to coverage, we then said, well, now that you've got the speed coming to the house, we now have all these different devices throughout the house. We all want those devices to work everywhere. So we took our many of you seen we build a technology center in Philadelphia, we have offices all over the world that assist that but we took that group and said, we want you to spend as much time innovating broadband more than just speed.\", \"So the first evidence of that was, well, let's come up with these gateways that are superfast. Can all Wi-Fi and then these extenders, these pods where you just plug them in and automatically authenticates right for you. You don't have to do anything. They've been tremendous, tremendously successful in something that we were first to market with.\", \"So then we pivoted to the next platform, which was Control. So again, I sometimes like to do demos here in New York because many of you don't get to experience our products. So we've branded all of this xFi and the Control evidence itself with some of the commercials that the kids are playing, doing different things on their computers, playing games, talking to their friends, and the parents say it's dinnertime. And boom, push the button, shut down the Wi-Fi in the whole house, and should pause it, have dinner, turn it back on, get your attention. \", \"These are a fabulous commercials immediately tell people if you buy Xfinity xFi you're getting something different than just 200 megabits of speed or whatever your package would get. And it becomes a relationship. So what we thought is that we should have a fourth leg to that stool and a growing segment in our broadband success has been broadband only.\", \"And so we have looked at our capabilities that we've created with our boxes, our voice remote, and our X1 platform. And we said, what if we can bring that to streaming only customers, broadband only customers. And so what we're announcing this morning is that we're going to take this product called Xfinity Flex which as you can see here, has some real connection back to the X1 platform.\", \"And again, for those of you who don't have X1, we're pretty convinced it's the best way to get video in the world. It's for Live television, sporting events, networks on demand, streaming services, it does it all. And we've had multiple Emmy Awards and as well as consumer acceptance that this is the best product in the market. We’ve been able to take that platform and bring it to Xfinity Flex and just as an example, if you take Netflix or Amazon Prime consumption on an X1 customers home, on our X1 platform, it's the number one way they consume within 90 days after they had X1 had Netflix and Amazon on the network.\", \"So we know that for streaming, it's the best way to do it. And so what we're announcing today is that we're going to give that box and the remote, new remote free to any broadband only customer. So what I thought I would quickly do is just give you a sense of what the product what Flex is which not many people have seen.\", \"So when you come to it, turn it on, it immediately goes back and we think streamers really want very personalized experiences, they know what they want, when they want it or they know what they like. And they're not just trying to navigate this broad packages, these are products they bought.\", \"So if we scroll across, it immediately starts playing video. This is a return the first row are things you've already been watching and you come back to them to start. If I drop down we have something called Free to Me and Free to Me is your entitlements. So if you have HBO or you have Hulu then it's included but we start with everybody has 10,000 free TV shows and movies that we Comcast to procured for you just to get Flex or just by having Flex right off the bat and then we add to it.\", \"If you come down, you will see here's the new Peacock but also YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Prime, HBO, Showtime, right on down. If you come down you'll see recommendations which is something that we found extremely popular and what's trending and on and on different ways to consume the content. And that's really what all of us have suffered with is, how do I know what I want to do and how do I get there quickly? Just as we have with X1, if you say, show me romantic comedies, you will quickly see that different is the way we present the results is here's romantic comedies on Netflix. \", \"Here they are in prime again, these are only going to show up with the services that you've purchased. By the way, if you want to buy one of these services that you don't currently subscribe. It's a couple clicks, really frictionless and you then add to it and your entitlements knows that here's all romantic comedies for you. If I say, The Walking Dead what you'll see pop up is something that I think we're number with the way content companies are licensing their content, sometimes you don't know what you're entitled to.\", \"So if we pop over this example, Walking Dead, I go into episodes. Here's the current season, and it's not service that I bought. So it's going to cost me $2.99 an episode. But if I go down to season 9, and I come down, here it shows it's free for me. Of course, I'm a Netflix customer. So we're finding ways to continually add value. If we come back down to this slide, we talked about Free to Me, here's Live TV. So there are a number of streaming services like ESPN3, which we have, which is live, which is free. Here's Chatter, here is Sky News and we'll be adding to that.\", \"Same time if I came down, here's surprise X1 and if you want to buy Live TV, you could just click an upgrade. Obviously, that's not what all will do. But we wanted to make it as easy as possible may do that with other services as well. So we'll be adding as we go, here's a category that we have new, which you'll be what's new episodes out this week, what new series are out that you're entitled to that you like based on your preferences, but I picked music here for a second.\", \"And again, we found as sure you know, television speakers are now becoming the best speaker in the house and important speaker in the house. So having all the music services available real easily was pretty important to us. And then finally, we're experimenting with a section, we're kind of saying, what's your digital dashboard, could the television be that device.\", \"So we'll have some information for you. But if I, if I scroll over, here's your home camera, and you can begin to use the television. But if I come down, I can see how many Wi-Fi, if my signals got an issue I can do, I can see how many devices I've got and make sure they're all online in a proper way. And we'll add as we go into Internet of Things and other things. Could this be a digital dashboard.\", \"So it's a really exciting to be able to say to our customers here, this is free for you taking our broadband and I think that given the scale and leveraging the investment that we've been able to make with X1, I think customers going to love this.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"So with Flex, you're basically reconnecting your broadband service with the feature set of video but without requiring those consumers to take on the cost that they historically would have been required to?\", 'Brian Roberts', 'And one of the things that we said years ago when streaming started to look more technically viable. Is that video over the Internet is more friend and foe to Comcast. Said that many times. And this is an example of it, people are consuming more video than ever before, there are more choices than ever before. But they want to do it differently. And we want to have the best product for our customers in each category.', \"And for many customers, they're going to want to just buy streaming services, they're buying \", \"our broadband only. We'd like them to see that this strategy are those four pillars now, not just the first one.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"And if we just think a little bit more broadly about video, because this is clearly a big part of the future of that business, you obviously are still a very large distributor of content in your traditional cable business. Historically you've been willing to absorb a lot of the programming costs increase there because you want to make sure your price points are supportive of customer growth but we've clearly seen the trend in the sector go the other ways and really for everybody and so a question that a lot of investors have this. How are you thinking about the role of your traditional video business? Comcast as cord cutting seems like it's accelerating?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"I think that trends here and that trend is going to stay. And we pivoted the strategy to company and we're not. We're heading back to where you started the very first question. We want to have a growth trajectory of that. So how do we accomplish that and with those facts? \", \"Well what's happened is not all video customers are anymore for us. We do see programming, programming costs can be lumpy, and we think some year, they're going to go up more than we would like or can control and I think that's very possible in the future.\", \"But what we've done is in most cases, we try to pass that along to the consumer that depends on the competitiveness of the market. But we've also recognized that for some customers valuable to us and others are less valuable. So let's not try to fight that trend, let's try to react to it and lower the bill to the consumer, like you just suggested with what Flex could do. So how we look at ourselves has been a big shift and therefore I would suggest it's how you should look at us. And that is customer relationships.\", \"And so in the first half of this year, our customer relationships were up 3%, we then look at what's the EBITDA per customer relationship to the point that not all revenue is the same given the expense that comes with it. Our job per customer relationship was up 5% in the first half of the year and our net cash flow per customer relationship was up 18% in the first half of the year. And I think that's what we're driving our operators to focus on.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"So even though the headline video losses may be greater than we've seen before because of the holistic way, you're managing that customer relationship, you still think you can stay on this growth trajectory at that level?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Yes. And with tremendous cost out of the business. Putting programming costs side, truck rolls, phone calls, capital expenditures, you can see it in why the net cash flow number was the largest and what I still what I just talked about, that's been happening for several years, and broadband, strategically to the question we were talking about is how can you make broadband more important, as you rely more on that cash flow?\", \"So you can continue that growth and the answer will be for some, it's video broadband double play. And for others, it will be broadband Flex. But that customer relationship is much richer. And that's why I think we've been able to grow Broadband for the 14 straight years or whatever is that we were just off with over a million a year.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'So we talked a little bit more about the profit profile of the Cable business and put some numbers on it. Your outlook is that you expect your Cable EBITDA margin to improve by a little better than 100 basis points this year. And that your CapEx intensities, your capital expenditures, as a percentage of your revenue will decline by at least 100 basis points. And so it certainly seems that as your Cable business becomes more broadband driven, your margins likely continue to trend higher, your capital intensity likely continues to trend lower.', 'So I guess my question is, do you actually agree with that? And if not, are there areas where you do think you need to step up some investment to make sure that that part of your business remains on a growth trajectory?', 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, I'm not going to comment outside of the numbers you just referenced. We wouldn't do that in the middle of the year. But I think we haven't seen anything changed the trajectory of the company, as we've been talking about, say for programming costs year-over-year. So I guess I rely, I rely less on actual margin.\", \"And I looked at, as I said, customer relationship EBITDA, net cash flow or the overall health of our customer relationship. And that then says how good is your product versus your competitor? And what is the value you're giving to the consumer? And I don't think we've ever been in a better place. With our peers said, I think our products are great, there's a benefit of the scale, putting together the company parts into a unique Comcast NBC, Universal and Sky. We're feeding off each other. And so I'm hopeful that the trends you’re talking can continue.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"All right. So let's talk more about Sky because it's been almost a year since you have acquired that business. You talked earlier about how you were leveraging some of Sky's skill sets in the direct-to-consumer video product. I was hoping we could talk maybe even more broadly about some of the key ways that you are leveraging Sky’s capabilities and vice versa. And then just generally speaking, what should investors be looking forward to see these benefits flowing through and your financial performance?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, what a difference a year makes, it's hard to believe it's almost a year since we've closed, not even. And I feel fantastic about Sky. And I have to say, it was complicated and at times uncertain as to how that all would work out. And it feels like more than a million years ago when that happened. And so that's because, to my delight, that when we got there, we found an incredible management team. They were relieved to be done with all the drama of the deal that had been overhanging them for as much as five years going way back before we entered this scene.\", \"Their market position is kind of even better than I realized, that we realized. So we found a culture where they thought the world was going and where Comcast Cable thought the world was going, and where NBCUniversal thought the world was going was identical. And we are well beyond integration. And we were immediately into how do we work together and make each other better than we are apart? And culturally, they’re entrepreneurial and they're winners. And I can't say enough great things about Jeremy Darroch and the team that we inherited.\", 'So one of the first things we did as people and helping us be better, what are the proof points ', 'of why are you better together than you were alone. So NBC wanted to launch Peacock. That was one of the first things Steve Burke wanted to do. And he said, well, we now have a company Now TV that has millions of experiences of customers doing streaming.', \"So they took the top two leaders, Gidon, Patrick moved to the States. They joined with Bonnie Hammer, who was running all the programming for NBC Cable, and together they're creating Peacock. We have hundreds of people working on creating that streaming service, 70%, 80% of them are Europe and we're repurposed to this project.\", \"Next, Comcast Cable has to build and make the boxes and the voice remote and the software to create X1, one of the Chief Engineers in the company gentlemen named Frazier, had worked at Sky many years back and we hired Frazier to Comcast Cable, he lived in Philadelphia the last five years. He's now moved back to Sky as the Chief Product Officer reporting to Jeremy but staying connected to the procurement and the design process for all of the boxes we have here in the U.S.\", \"So all of our hardware, and all of our software is sort of synced up at the hip between the two companies even though we come from a Cable versus a satellite background. What we're going to give the consumer and products for their big part of that will be Cable having helping helped Sky by having Frazier go back.\", \"Third, we took - these were just a few examples, the Head of Global Strategy for all of Comcast Corp working for Mike Cavanagh, Divesh wanted to get into operations, he's now living in Germany, and helping Sky’s leadership in Continental Europe. Sky has tremendous customer loyalty programs and marketing success with their brand, which is there's no brand in the U.S. in our space that's like Sky’s brand in Europe.\", \"One of their senior Marketing Leaders who has just announced as moving to Comcast Cable will be the Chief Marketing Officer for the company. And so it goes, I won't go through that. We're business services, we've taken one of our business service leaders, they don't do business services at Sky and they take a while to ramp it up. We've sent them over, we've taken the xFi pods and the xFi app and the entire broadband strategy. And we're taking that to Italy to help Sky launch.\", \"So Sky has helped NBC, Sky is helping Cable, Cable is helping Sky, NBC content we're going as I mentioned Sky Studios be synced at the hip where when we build Sky Studios, probably 60% of the productions will be Universal.\", \"So we are deeply integrated right out of the box, consumers are going to see these benefits. And I guess I would just end that question by saying sitting here a year later, I feel so much better about Sky than the moment in time when we had to do it or don't do it, given what was going on. And I think it's going to be a really valuable part of having the unique 55 million customers around the world that no other company quite has.\", 'Brett Feldman', 'Your acquisition of Sky more than doubled your international exposure to a little over 25% of your revenue. And you have previously noted that when you were bidding for Fox, it was mostly about an international expansion opportunity. So the question here is, what is Comcast international strategy? And do you think you have the right scale as really as the media model becomes more global I guess?', 'Brian Roberts', \"I think Sky was unique. It was number one by a wide margin. It's really healthy, we've seen European and other economies all have some softness here with things that are the time that we live in, and these will come and go. But over many, many decades, they've been number one. And I think their lead is widening and no, I don't feel that we have to go to other geographies. This was a unique opportunity. And the Sky brand is available in other geographies with different technology. So we're pretty happy to say the least.\", 'Brett Feldman', \"Right, so I want to end sort of where we started. And as you alluded to with your comments earlier, from 9 to last 10 years, you've been able to grow earnings per share at a double-digit rate, and you were very close in that 10th year. Is that right? The right way of thinking about the earnings growth outlook for Comcast over the next 10 years?\", 'Brian Roberts', \"Well, I'm not going to take the bait on the next 10 years. And I know this have a crystal ball. Right, the one thing, the way I have tried to function is have their absolute best people and let them they're going to be smarter than you are, and let them do their thing and have a culture that they want to work on the team and there's a satisfaction to be on the team that's the best team.\", \"And so we've got to get into right swim lanes. And I think, go back to that first question. Broadband is a great swim lane. And we're not even 50%. And we like our competitive offering. And we're going to make it better every day.\", \"The change in video, NBC has got a rich history, we needed to find a way that work for us, not just follow the pack. And I think we're doing that and I'm excited and we'll make changes as we go. That's just how we operate. And then you need a strong balance sheet and a philosophy of returning capital to shareholders and making it a win. And so you said to me is nine out of 10, you're most proud statistic. No, I would sit here and say the most proud statistic is that we went public in 1972.\", \"We've had over 17% compounded return on the stock for almost half a century. And but some periods as you started, people put a higher value than a lower value, try to operate in a world that you think you can build shareholder value. And so in that regard, our balance sheet has been important to us. And so we paused the buyback with the purchase of Sky but it's our hope to pay down the debt as quickly as possible.\", 'And to that end, we went out and monetized Hulu or a portion hopefully of our Hulu stake to accelerate some of the debt pay down but will increase the dividend last year and return to the philosophy of try to get to the philosophy where we can invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and have success in the longer term.', 'Brett Feldman', 'Brian, thanks for being here.', 'Brian Roberts', 'Thanks Brett.'], ['BeyondSpring Inc.

Dr. Ramon Mohanlal, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer, who will provide a clinical update; Richard Daly, Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss BeyondSpring's marketing and partnership strategy; and Edward Liu, Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a financial update.\", 'It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to Dr. Huang. Lan?', 'Lan Huang', 'Thank you, Steve. Thank you for joining the call today, ladies and gentlemen. For those of you who are new to our story, BeyondSpring is a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and transforming immunooncology cancer therapies to address severely unmet medical needs. Our lead asset, a first-in-class asset, Plinabulin is in two Phase 3 global clinical programs, one as a direct anticancer agent in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and the other in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or CIN.', \"Since our last call, we continued to generate new data that characterize Plinabulin's unique study design and differentiated profile that further supports its potential to significantly improve cancer care. In second and third line non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR wild type, which accounts for 70% to 85% of Western patients, there are currently only four approved therapies available with limited survival benefit at around 8 to 10 months median overall survival, and certain SAEs such as severe neutropenia. Even PD-1 antibody’s response rate is around 20% and only has 2.8 months median survival benefit compared to docetaxel, the standard of care in this patient population.\", 'In CIN, the current standard of prevention care is G-CSF, such as Neulasta. However, the vast majority of patients with high-risk chemotherapy still develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, some over 90% after using Neulasta. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia requires the chemotherapy dose be reduced, the next cycle be delayed, the chemo regime be downgraded, or discontinued altogether. We call them the 4 Ds. All of this results in significantly worse survival outcomes for patients. As a result, both indications present significant unmet medical need. Plinabulin has the potential to disrupt the current treatment landscape and greatly improve the overall patient outcome. Earlier this year, we reached the first pre-specified interim analysis of Study 103 for Plinabulin in the second- and third-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR wild type. After reviewing with Data and the Safety Monitoring Board or DSMB on the safety and efficacy data, they recommend the trial to continue.', \"Last year, we generated extensive data suggesting Plinabulin's potential to meaningfully improve patient outcomes in CIN when combined with G-CSF. In Study 105 and 106, data generated indicates that Plinabulin significantly reduces bone pain, prevents thrombocytopenia, and reverses potential immune suppression of Neulasta. In addition, we generated data characterizing Plinabulin's unique mechanism of action supporting a differentiated product profile in the prevention of CIN, which appears to have a complementary therapeutic effect with G-CSF. We view Plinabulin as a pipeline in the drug. So far, Plinabulin had treated over 560 patients with good tolerability. The foundation stage is to established Plinabulin as an anticancer and CIN drug. We already had four clinical studies to confirm Plinabulin’s CIN benefit and two clinical studies to show Plinabulin's anticancer benefit in non-small cell lung cancer.\", 'The next stage is translation stage by combining Plinabulin with other chemo to treat additional cancer types. The transformation stage is to have triple combo of Plinabulin plus checkpoint inhibitors and chemo. This triple combo completes a perfect I/O cycle as chemo generates tumor antigens, Plinabulin induces DC maturation and activates tumor antigen specific T-cells and checkpoint inhibitors let T-cells kill cancer cells. We envision this triple combo could be as powerful as that of cocktail therapy for HIV.', \"Our regulatory strategy includes filing of NDAs for both non-small cell lung cancer and CIN in China in the first quarter of 2020 and in the US in 2020. In June this year, we had an end-of-Phase 2 meetings for CIN indication and aligned with the FDA that Study 105 and 106 support a broad CIN label for all cancer and all chemo. We also continued to strengthen our robust intellectual property portfolio. Plinabulin's monohydrate composition is now allowed in China, in addition to the US. A new method of used patents for Plinabulin in treating brain tumor is recently issued. Both patents are protected through 2036. The issuance of this patent further extends our proprietary rights and strengthens Plinabulin's global intellectual property position. We now have a total granted patent portfolio of 77 patents in 36 jurisdictions, including 21 issued US patents with protection until 2036.\", 'In recent months, we strengthened our balance sheet through a number of equity financings. The proceeds from these financing are to support our clinical and pre-clinical development, and well position us to achieve the planned regulatory milestones. In addition, we are also well on track in advancing three preclinical immune agents, BPI-002, BPI-003, and BPI-004 and a research platform using ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway.', 'I will now turn the call to Ramon, who will discuss our recent clinical development in more detail. Ramon?', 'Ramon Mohanlal', 'Thanks, Lan. First, I would like to provide an update on our registrational trials for our lead asset, Plinabulin. Study 103 is a 554-patient, Phase 3 registrational study evaluating the anticancer effects of Plinabulin in combination with docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone in the second and third line non-small cell lung cancer with its primary endpoint of median overall survival. To date, we have enrolled approximately 450 patients in the US, Australia, and China. The study has two pre-specified interim analysis; the first, at one-third of patient death events; and the second, at two-thirds of patient death event. Earlier this year, we reached the first interim analysis, and DSMB recommended the trial to continue.', \"The second interim analysis is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. If the p-value for the median overall survival and the second interim analysis is less or equal to 0.012, the trial may stop early. If the p-value is greater than 0.012, the trial will continue and final results of the trial at a death event of 439 patients are expected to be available in 2020. If the p-value for median overall survival for the final result is less than or equal to 0.046, the study can be claimed successful. The study's novel design in targeted population selection was presented at the IASLC World Conference on Lung Cancer last week.\", \"Study 105 and Study 106 evaluate Plinabulin's effect in the prevention of chemo-induced neutropenia. Study 105 is a Phase 2, 3 registrational trial of Plinabulin, after the standard regimen of docetaxel in advanced breast cancer, hormone refractory prostate cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in the US, China, Russia and the Ukraine. The primary endpoint of this trial is duration of severe neutropenia or DSM in the first cycle of chemotherapy compared to the standard of care, Neulasta. Previous data from the Phase 2 portion of this trial already demonstrated that Plinabulin given as a single dose cycle on the same day of chemotherapy would be as effective as Neulasta with the benefit of causing much less bone pain, offering a superior immune profile compared with Neulasta, having the potential to mitigate thrombocytopenia while its unique mechanism of action potentially makes it complementary to Neulasta in preventing CIN.\", 'In December 2018, we announced in a pre-specified interim analysis the Phase 3 portion of Study 105 met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority of Plinabulin 40 milligram fixed dose versus Neulasta 6 milligram for DSM of the first cycle. This was confirmed at the DSMB meeting chaired by Dr. Crawford, Chairman of the NCCN, Guidelines for Neutropenia Management in the US. This data combined with Phase 2 data suggests that Plinabulin has a superior product profile and well positions us to file NDAs for Plinabulin for CIN in China in the first quarter of 2020 followed by the US in 2020 with additional data from the Phase 3 portion of Study 106. Study 106 evaluates the combination of Plinabulin with Neulasta versus Neulasta alone to prevent CIN and bone pain in patients receiving TAC chemotherapy, which is the triple combination of taxotere, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in breast cancer patients.', 'Previous topline data from the Phase 2 portion of this trial suggests a significant improvement in efficacy in treating CIN, a significant decrease in the percentage of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 CIN, more than 90% reduction in patients experiencing bone pain and reduced potential for immune-suppressive phenotype when adding Plinabulin to the standard of care. The Phase 3 portion of Study 106 is to compare Plinabulin at 40 milligram fixed dose combined with 6 milligram Neulasta versus 6 milligram Neulasta alone in a double-blind study. The aim of the study is to show superiority in DSM in the first cycle as a primary endpoint. Together, this data suggest that Plinabulin offers a new approach to preventing CIN and bone pain in patients receiving chemotherapy. Less neutropenia and bone pain would enable more patients to receive a full dose of chemotherapy and complete their full chemo course, meaning that the addition of Plinabulin may meaningfully improve the current CIN standard of care and generate better patient outcomes.', 'Since our last call, we reported additional data supporting Plinabulin favorable drug profile. In May 2019, BeyondSpring announced the two abstracts based on data derived from the Phase 2 portion of Study 106 were accepted for publications in the proceedings of the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting. The first abstract concluded that adding Plinabulin to the standard dose of Neulasta offered superior CIN protection throughout the entire high risk TAC cycle. Not only is this degree of CIN protection unachievable when using just one of these two agents, with the addition of Plinabulin also eradicated bone pain compared to Neulasta alone. The second abstract concluded that a half dose of Neulasta combined with Plinabulin is equally effective against CIN as a full dose of Neulasta alone demonstrating a strong neutropenia benefit. The combination therapy also offered significantly lower levels of bone pain for patients as well as favorable immune profile compared to Neulasta alone. This data suggest that the Plinabulin-Neulasta combination creates added benefits that are not seen with Neulasta alone, providing additional rationale for the use of this combination to more effectively treat CIN.', \"Also in May, at the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research 2019 Conference, Dr. Douglas Blayney, global Principal Investigator for BeyondSpring's CIN development program and Professor of Medicine at Stanford University Medical Center presented data derived from the Phase 2 portion of Study 105. The data demonstrated that Plinabulin has a similar efficacy profile as Neulasta in reducing docetaxel induced neutropenia, however Plinabulin significantly reduced patients report to bone pain.\", \"More recently, we announced results of a head to head clinical trial assessing quality of life in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients being treated with docetaxel and either Plinabulin or Neulasta for the prevention of neutropenia in Study 105. It demonstrated that Plinabulin significantly improved quality of life over four cycles of treatment. Moreover, there were significant improvements in patients quality of life in terms of fatigue, pain and insomnia. This strengthens Plinabulin's profile as an agent that is as effective as Neulasta at preventing CIN between the superior side-effect profile that improves patient quality of life, in part because of its significant reduction in bone pain.\", \"With that, I'll turn the call to Rich, who will discuss our marketing and partnering strategy. Rich?\", 'Richard Daly', 'Thanks Ramon. Our most recent data releases continue to support a differentiated product profile and we believe that Plinabulin can improve the standard of care and positively affect the lives of patients with cancer, those who require prevention of neutropenia and those seeking options for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and we continue to advance the organization toward commercialization.', \"This morning, I'll be addressing three components of our commercialization prospects; the CIN opportunity, the evolving non-small cell lung cancer market and our business development strategy that supports the excellent work of our clinical team.\", 'First, the CIN opportunity. 4 million cycles of monotherapy G-CSF are used worldwide each year to prevent CIN today. In May of this year, Wilson and colleagues published a study in the Lancet forecasting the growth of oncology and chemotherapy regimens through 2040. Wilson stated that they expected cancer diagnoses to grow from 17 million cases worldwide to over 26 million. Additionally, the number of first course chemotherapy cycles will grow by 53% over this time from 9.8 million to over 15 million. As a result, we expect the use of supportive care therapies like Plinabulin to participate in this growth. As Lan noted earlier, there is an opportunity to improve on the standard of care and improve the outcome for patients. The clinical profile that both Lan and Ramon referred to presents a clear case for superiority in the prevention of CIN and the potential for increasing compliance and persistency with chemotherapeutic regimens with the hope that outcomes will be improved.', 'Our market research demonstrates the opportunity to build the case for Plinabulin as a therapy that can improve the standard of care through maintaining dose intensity and keeping patients on their scheduled dose intervals. These are critical success factors in the treatment of cancer. Even small changes in dosing or brief delays in infusions can add detrimental effects on overall survival. In fact, a 15% reduction in chemo doses can result in a 50% reduction in long-term overall survival, a devastating result.', \"Our proprietary market research indicates that oncologists have a very favorable response to Plinabulin's product profile. Also, physicians quickly grasp the logic of the complementary MOAs of both Plinabulin and G-CSF. The speed of onset of Plinabulin versus the delayed onset of G-CSF is critical. Additionally, the superior absolute neutrophil count is also a benefit when combined with G-CSF and then the reduction in bone pain is also a benefit. As a result, the oncologists understood the rationale for the Plinabulin plus G-CSF combination for the immediate clinical as well as the potential long-term benefits of keeping patients on planned chemotherapy regimen, dosing and cycle timing. Neutropenia is the number one cause of changes in chemotherapy regimens and the combination of Plinabulin Plus G-CSF shows great promise and [indiscernible] oncologist and the patient to stick to the individualized treatment plan and avoid the 4Ds that Lan mentioned earlier.\", \"Our goals go beyond preventing neutropenia and bone pain. We see Plinabulin's clinical benefit as a tool for providers to potentially generate better chemotherapeutic outcomes, that is, provide the clinician with the opportunity to choose the most appropriate, most aggressive therapy for the patients and have the confidence that prophylaxis with Plinabulin plus G-CSF, neutropenia can be significantly reduced and patients can remain on their targeted chemotherapy. The data generated to-date by the BeyondSpring clinical team under Dr.Mohanlal's leadership has produced data that supports not only this view, but also provides intriguing insight into the potential life-cycle management opportunities for the use of Plinabulin beyond non-small cell lung cancer and the prevention of CIN in chemotherapy only regimens.\", \"Our ongoing data generation continues to give us confidence that combination therapy that is Plinabulin plus G-CSF can become the new standard of care for prophylaxis of neutropenia. Additionally, we believe that market dynamics such as the growth of chemotherapy and success of the combination approach, Plinabulin plus G-CSF that CIN is a growth opportunity. Finally, the recent success of biosimilars in the CIN space fully supports our strategy with increased choice and improved cost profile due to the biosimilar G-CSF success, the combination approach has the potential to become even more attractive to providers and payers. Plinabulin's position is straightforward. Plinabulin combined with G-CSF builds on and improves standard of care for the prevention of CIN.\", 'Our second topic is non-small cell lung cancer. This therapeutic area continues to evolve rapidly. The recent advancements in care with the approval of PD1s and PDL1s in combination with chemotherapy are indicative as the long-term importance of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. The advancement of I/O therapy represents a number of opportunities for BeyondSpring and Plinabulin. First, as I alluded first line therapy, we expect to see greater opportunities for products like Plinabulin. As Lan mentioned in her early remarks, the options were second and third line non-small cell lung cancer are not ideal and Plinabulin could represent a significant advancement for these patients. Second, our early work in combination with I/O compounds may demonstrate benefits over and above that, which currently you have seen with I/O alone. This may represent an additional significant growth opportunity to help patients and providers struggling to address this devastating disease.', \"Third, as mentioned earlier, studies indicate that chemotherapy, a mainstay of cancer treatment is expected to grow in the mid to long-term. Much of this increase in volume has been driven by the combination with newer I/O therapies. As discussed earlier, these chemotherapy will likely give rise to CIN. Plinabulin's immunologic data generated to-date demonstrates that Plinabulin unlike G-CSF does not cause immune suppression. In this therapeutic paradigm, Plinabulin could be the ideal partner for I/O therapies. Finally, with a durable response of checkpoint inhibitors, we expect I/O chemotherapy cycles to be significantly expanded, thus creating an increased need for products like Plinabulin to be used to protect patients from CIN.\", 'Finally, our third topic, business development. We believe Plinabulin has tremendous potential, both as a CIN and non-small cell cancer direct anticancer therapy. The data generated from our clinical programs to-date support this view. Plinabulin offers a differentiated mechanism of action, it is supported by clinical data and has the potential to positively affect the care of patients suffering with cancer. The current market size for both CIN and non-small cell lung cancer, the unmet medical needs in both of these markets and the Plinabulin profile have positioned Plinabulin as an asset of interest with well-established pharma partners. Our business development strategy is to leverage Plinabulin to create the greatest value for patients, providers, payers and shareholders. While the number of cancer cases outside the US exceeds those within the borders, the majority of commercial value resides within the US. Consequently, we seek partners that will enable BeyondSpring to retain the greatest value here in the US, while enabling us to leverage partner infrastructure to launch abroad. We seek partners who can commercialize Plinabulin outside the US on their own, while we retain significant rights to CIN and non-small cell lung cancer in US. We are actively engaged in multiple late stage discussions with potential partners who are aligned with our strategy. We look forward to updating you in the future on our progress.', \"With that, I'll turn the call over to Edward, who will provide a financial update. Edward?\", 'Edward Liu', \"Thanks, Rich. I'll now briefly discuss our second quarter 2019 financial results. For greater details related to these results, I'll refer you to our press release issued this morning and our 6-K filing, both of which can be accessed on our website.\", \"With that said, I'll just highlight some key numbers. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2019 were $5.2 million compared to $11 million in the same period last year. The decrease of $5.8 million was largely attributable to a $3.9 million decrease in expenses incurred by CROs and other service fees related to clinical trials, a $1.1 million decrease in manufacturing expenses and a $0.8 million decrease in non-cash share-based compensation. G&A expenses were $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $1.4 million for the same quarter of 2018. The increase was mainly due to non-cash share-based compensation. Net loss attributable to BeyondSpring in the second quarter of 2019 was $7.4 million compared to $12.2 million for the same period last year. Cash balance on June 30th 2019 were $0.7 million.\", 'In recent months, we have strengthened our balance sheet through a number of equity financing transactions. On July the 19th, we closed a $35 million public offering led by Decheng Capital. The transaction attracted strong demand from high quality US-based investors and was highly oversubscribed [ph]. In June and July, our China subsidiary entered into a series of equity purchase agreements with certain investors led by Efung Capital to acquire a 4.76% stake in the China subsidiary for approximately RMB100 million or $14.5 million. We have so far received approximately $10 million. In May, we put in place an ATM facility and raised approximately $30 million before it was suspended in July in anticipation of the aforementioned public offering. We believe our cash resources, including the net proceeds from these financings are sufficient to support our clinical trials and submit NDA in China for Plinabulin for the treatment of CIN and non-small cell lung cancer and to advance our immuno-oncology pipeline as well as our ubiquitination protein degradation research platform.', \"With that, I'll now turn the call back to Lan. Lan?\", 'Lan Huang', \"Thank you, Edward. We are very pleased with the progress at our clinical development and the consistency that generated so far that further supports Plinabulin's favorable drug profile to improve cancer care. Looking forward, we expect many important data and regulatory milestones over the next 12 to 18 months, which will transform us from a clinical stage company to a commercial stage company. Together with our shareholders, investors and partners, we are working hard to continue to create value and to deliver innovative medicines to the patients in need. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress towards the goal in the coming months.\", 'We named our company BeyondSpring with two meanings. First is beyond borders, we integrate US and China resources together to achieve time and cost efficiencies and to target these two largest pharmaceutical markets in the world. This unique and scalable business model will maximize the return for our shareholders. Second is beyond season. We like to go from sowing a whole season of spring directly to the harvest season of NDA. As you are all aware, the harvest season or autumn is just around the corner.', 'This concludes our call today. Thank you everyone for joining.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', \"Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andy Hsieh with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\", 'Andy Hsieh', \"Hey, thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on all the progress Lan and the BeyondSpring team. So, I have a couple. I think Lan, you mentioned some pre-clinical assets, basically 002, 003, and 004. Can you provide a little bit more information about, is that from the ubiquitin class or it's more similar to the Plinabulin follow-on asset?\", 'Lan Huang', \"Okay. Thank you, Andy, for the questions on our pipeline. So, actually 002, 003, and 004, they are the immune related pre-clinical assets. I will let Ramon to tell you a little bit more in detail, but in addition to that, we do have ubiquitination and degradation platform and that's in a very advanced stage of development, and our first target is the KRAS and that's the Holy Grail target. So, probably you I turn to Ramon to answer the questions on the pre-clinical assets.\", 'Ramon Mohanlal', 'Yes. The 002, 003, and 004 assets are immune enhancing agents. They are small molecule agents. So, this is a small molecule play as opposed to biologics. 002 is like a CTLA-4 like costimulator, 003 is a signaling pathway modulator, and 004 is a drug that can induce the neo-antigens in cancers that typically do not express enough antigen to stimulate immune system.', 'Andy Hsieh', \"Great. Okay, Yes. I just wanted to clarify that fact. So, I also wanted to check my understanding. So you talked about the first interim look. I believe, in the first interim look basically asks a question about threshold, the hazard ratio of threshold of 0.75. If it's above, then the enrollment was designed to increase to capture the full powering of the study. So, is it correct to assume that at least in the first 33% of the population, you are seeing a hazard ratio of 0.75 or less? Is that a correct assumption for research [ph]?\", 'Lan Huang', \"Yes. Yes, so because -- so, there's no change in the design, no increase in sample size, so this is an estimate of hazard ratio equal or less than 0.75.\", 'Andy Hsieh', 'Okay. Got it. And then about the National Reimbursement Review in China, I believe that happens every other year. So, this year, it is going to be a little bit later. So, when submitting for National Reimbursement Review next year, is that going to be for the 2021 cycle or the 2020 cycle? I just want to get a sense of the kind of the review seasonality?', 'Lan Huang', \"Yes. So actually, in China the previous years every eight years, they're going to do this national insurance evaluation. But now, actually it's increasing the frequency of reviewing of the assets for national insurance and it could even be more than just every other year. So ,we see agents like Tagrisso and other actually very -- national like China develop its assets, also getting to the national insurance right after the approval. So I'm expecting that if we're so lucky to get this drug approved by 2020 or 2021, we should be able to start negotiating with the government probably right after the approval.\", 'Andy Hsieh', \"I see. Okay. And I think I have a question for Rich about the biosimilar impact. So Amgen has this Onpro, which improves on the convenience. So with the biosimilar entry back to the market, do you see the convenience factor getting worse because patients receiving the biosimilar probably have to come back and get that shot. And do you think that's an opening for BeyondSpring to offer a more convenient product on the market?\", 'Richard Daly', \"So, I think that's a really good question. I think that this is becoming from a biosimilar and innovator on the G-CSF side, it's becoming a pretty price sensitive market because there's no incremental innovation. The value that Plinabulin brings is incremental innovation in combination with G-CSF. So, you pulled back to your point, we see Coherus having great success. They predict -- in their most recent announcement, they're going to end up with a 20% volume share. We see share coming down slightly for Amgen, price coming down significantly, obviously as you see the biosimilars take share. But for us, because we're at 30-minute infusion, 30-minutes after chemotherapy on the day of chemotherapy, we think this is a pretty significant advancement and convenience. But the market research that we've done Andy, the doctors are incredibly excited about the standard of care improvement for the patient.\", \"So, we see even with Onpro, if you look at some of the data that Amgen has generated with, they did some work with IQVIA, 200,000 cycles they did. Even with that, there's a significant amount of dose delays. So, patients are experiencing challenges with their chemotherapy, and 25% of the patients have dose delays because of neutropenia or other issues, even with Onpro. So, we're seeing the opportunity to go in here and say, we can actually improve on the standard of care and work with biosimilars or work with the innovator, the brand. So our convenience, I think is good. The physicians in our market research respond very favorably to the convenience and for the clinic flow because obviously the patient is there and they're in the chair already and so we think we have a really good story all the way around from convenience to working with biosimilars or with the innovator and then improving on the standard of care. We think we can really work all the way through the entire story.\", 'Andy Hsieh', 'Great. Thank you for that. And last question from me, I promise. So Edward, I think you were mentioning several subsequent fundraising events. Would you mind providing us with like a rough cash balance at this moment?', 'Edward Liu', \"Well, as you know and also as we disclosed, we raised $13 million from the ATM. We raised $35 million from the follow-on offerings in July and also we've raised approximately $10 million from the China subsidiary offering. So that gave us approximately close to $60 million. And I think so far we are a little bit down from there due to some payments to the vendors over the last two months, but these cash we think is sufficient to support both lead indications to complete the NDA both for China and US. So yes, I hope that answers your question.\", 'Andy Hsieh', \"Yes, that's super helpful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yes. Well, thank you very much for answering all my questions.\", 'Lan Huang', 'Thank you, Andy.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Pantginis with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.', 'Joe Pantginis', \"Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two questions, if you don't mind. First, regarding the upcoming interim, just the logistical question for Study 103. If you don't hit the interim p-value of 0.012, as Ramon mentioned, would we expect to see a press release, that's the typical continuous planned press release or would you look to provide any additional information?\", 'Lan Huang', \"Thank you so much, Joe. Thanks for the question. Yes. So if we are so lucky to hit it, of course, we have to go through the DSMB and FDA and announce the good news. But if we don't, then as you know, that we will just issue the study is going to continue as planned.\", 'Joe Pantginis', \"Okay. Now that's helpful. Just wanted to make sure. And then my second question is really wanting to focusing on the background activities at the companies with regard to the upcoming or expected CFDA filing in China for Plinabulin. What can you be doing ahead of data or what are you doing ahead of data with regard to the filing? Have you been able to submit anything yet? Do you have to submit it all at the same time? And then also concomitantly, what are you doing in the background with regard to potential commercialization preparations?\", 'Lan Huang', \"Thanks. I will take the first question on the China submission and then Rich will answer about the commercial readiness question from you. Those are all great questions. So for China, we have different rules there. As you know, October 2017, China government had to issue to really promote innovation, and also to target this cancer -- this is severely the indication for the population. So what they say is for those life-threatening diseases including late stage cancers, the companies can do rolling submission of the NDA and they can use interim data with the efficacy trend to submit. And then the government will give the conditional approval based on the efficacy trend and then later, of course, the company has to finish the whole study and get to the final look and then that if it still supports the approval, then the government will give the approval. So this is how we follow with the current strategy. So as you see that for the CIN study, for the 105 Phase 3 interim we did announce last December that meet the interim analysis to have statistical significance. DSMB has also agreed with that and also we have from topline I will have superior data. So both of them will enable us to submit with China conditional approval for the CIN. And then as you see for the non-small cell lung cancer, we do have a pretty positive interim analysis in the first look, right. [Indiscernible] ratio points is tremendous, right. Even with the nivolumab versus docetaxel in this severely affected [ph] population there has a ratio in 0.73 and then for ramucirumab plus Docetaxel, the approval was only based on ratio 0.86, right. So that's a very encouraging trend in efficacy that enable us to also through the rolling submission. So far we haven't submitted yet, but that's why in our press releases we say in the quarter one of 2020, because there's a lot of things going on for the submission package. For the CMC, we are done, for the pre-clinical we are also done, but also to the CSR and other things, it does take time.\", 'Joe Pantginis', 'Got it.', 'Lan Huang', 'So, okay. So, Rich will answer you on the commercial question.', 'Richard Daly', \"So thanks, Joe. So philosophically, we're aligned between the US and China. So between the two countries, the global amount of G-CSF unit is 66% of the global utilization of G-CSF. So our price is significantly better, obviously from previous statements we've made from the company, 75% of the global value is in the US but China is growing at a 33% clip on a dollar basis. So we believe there's tremendous value and tremendous opportunity in China, not only because of the volume of cancer cases, but obviously because of the G-CSF growth and the opportunity to improve care for patients who are suffering with cancer in China. So our goal is to hold onto as much value in these two critical markets as possible. With that said, we want to be smart about entering China. We want to be really thoughtful about it because obviously it's a very complex market. Also taking into consideration, the size of the market, but the concentration of cancer care. Cancer care in China is concentrated basically into five cities. So one does not have to cover, I should say companies does not have to cover the entire country to cover cancer care. So we're working right now on the BD front to identify and we are in deep discussions with companies who can -- top companies who can actually cover these markets and our experience in these markets -- cancer market, specifically. But I'm sort of giving you the back and the forth on it. The most recent capital raise we had in China gives us great confidence that we can be a very strong negotiation partner with these companies. So we're looking at creating, again, as much value as possible for our shareholders by holding on to as much of the long-term value for the asset as possible. What we don't want to do is get into a situation where China continues to grow and we've -- our license at a very low residual. So we're looking to make sure we get the best partner possible. It is complex. I want to be really clear. It's not necessarily first order priority to build an infrastructure in China on the back of one molecule. However, we believe that the P&L can support a product like Plinabulin because we believe price will be relatively healthy and cost of goods is solid. It's a very good cost of goods and cost of sales will be very light compared to other products and especially with the concentration of care in China, we think this is a really good opportunity for us or for our partner as we think about entering to China. So our discussions are advanced in China and we believe we are a very strong negotiation adversary or partner there as well. So we're looking for the best value possible and the quick [indiscernible] given the timelines that Lan has discussed in the past.\", 'Joe Pantginis', 'Got it. Very helpful Lan and Rich. Thanks a lot.', 'Richard Daly', 'Sure.', 'Lan Huang', 'Thank you, Joe.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session.

Welcome to DAVIDsTEA’s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference call is being recorded and all lines are in a listen-only mode.', 'Before we get started, I would like to remind you of the company’s Safe Harbor language. This presentation includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for the performance of our business in the coming quarter and year. Each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such statements. Additional information regarding these factors appears under the heading Risk Factors in our Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 2, 2019, and is available at www.sec.gov and on DAVIDsTEA’s website. The forward-looking statements in this discussion speak only as of today’s date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.', 'If any non-IFRS financial measure is used on this call, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure will be detailed in our Form 10-Q, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. As a reminder, all dollar amounts referred to are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated.', 'Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Herschel Segal, Founder, Executive Chairman and Interim CEO of DAVIDsTEA.', 'Herschel Segal', 'Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. With me today is Frank Zitella, DAVIDsTEA’s Chief Operating Officer and CFO.', 'Our second quarter results highlight the very solid progress of our e-commerce and wholesale channels, which posted a combined growth of 53% over last year. Both channels have been identified as areas of future growth for DAVIDsTEA and benefited from recent initiatives led by our solid leadership team. We are also continuing to actively work on additional initiatives to improve the performance of our stores. After almost one year of launching our tea sachets with a major Canadian grocery chain, I’m very pleased to say that sales continue to surpass our expectations.', 'As we have previously announced, the availability of our tea sachets within the supermarket and drugstore networks will be expanded significantly over the upcoming months. We are also looking at wholesale opportunities south of the border. For us, our success to date in the wholesale channel clearly demonstrates that our brand and teas remain in high demand wherever available to consumers.', 'We recently unveiled part of DAVIDsTEA’s fall 2019 collection of classic and new fall flavors, including a new and expanded wellness collection. I’m truly excited by the new collection and by others to come, leading up to the holiday season. Again, I want to emphasize the hard work and dedication of our leadership team and of all our employees. Our progress in e-commerce and within the wholesale channel, coupled with our plans going forward, provide confidence that we are on the right path to return DAVIDsTEA to profitability and growth. I also want to inform you that one of the directors – our directors, Anne Darche, has advised us of her departure from the Board due to time constraints. We thank Anne for her service and wish her well.', 'And with that, I will turn the call over to Frank for a review of our various initiatives and our financial results.', 'Frank Zitella', 'Thanks, Herschel, and good afternoon, everyone.', 'In the first half of 2019, we concentrated our efforts on delivering the best fine tea on the market across our entire distribution channel. We also streamlined our portfolio of products to improve our customers’ in-store experience. The second quarter is generally our weakest due to seasonality, yet we were able to maintain a strong cash position driven by positive cash flow from operations.', 'When compared to the second quarter last year, we generated positive cash flow from operations of $3.1 million compared to negative $12.4 million. The significant improvement was largely driven by optimized inventory levels and a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. While the cash position declined sequentially to $29.7 million due to normal business seasonality, the negative variance when compared to last year was notably lower due to factors just discussed.', 'Let me now go briefly into some of the specifics for the quarter. Sales decreased by $1 million and 2.5% to $39.2 million from $40.2 million for the same period in 2018. Sales from e-commerce and wholesale channels increased $2.8 million or 52.8%. This increase was driven primarily by greater online adoption as well as from increased demand from our grocery chain distribution across Canada.', 'With regards to our stores, retail sales declined by $3.8 million and comparable same-store sales decreased by 9.4%. We ended the quarter with 233 stores compared to 239 stores last year. When you look at our mix of the product categories, teas were up by 6.2% over last year, while accessories remain under pressure. We’re certainly hoping to change this trend, starting with our new fall collections.', 'Last week, we announced a unique collaboration with Beau’s Brewing, an organic Canadian brewery. Together, we’ll launch the DAVIDsTEA London Fog beer, a unique recipe concept that infuses Organic Cream of Earl Grey into a golden ale brewed with lactose and rich vanilla. The DAVIDsTEA London Fog beer will be widely available this fall at LCBO and grocery stores in Ontario as well as different areas and grocery outlets in Quebec. This is a concrete example of how we are implementing different alternatives to fully exploit the tremendous potential of our brand.', 'Gross profit increased by 25.7% to $21.8 million from the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, gross profit decreased by $1.3 million to $16 million. The decline is attributable primarily to a shift in product sales mix and a deleveraging of fixed costs due to negative comparable sales. ', 'SG&A decreased by 13.1% to $27.2 million from the prior year. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, SG&A would have amounted to $23.4 million, a decrease of 25.3%. However, adjusted SG&A decreased by $1.2 million. This decrease primarily reflects cost streamlining efforts of the past few quarters.', 'Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter amounted to $0.4 million compared to a negative $5.6 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and stock-based compensation for the three months ended August 3, 2019, and the impact of stock-based compensation, executive separation costs related to salaries, impairment of property and equipment, owners’ contracts, deferred rents and costs related to the strategic review and proxy contest for the three months ended August 4, 2018, adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.1 million.', 'As outlined in our 10-Q and press release, DAVIDsTEA entered into a secured loan agreement with Oink Oink Candy Inc., doing business as Squish, pursuant to which the company advanced $1.8 million as of August 3, 2019. The loan facility under this agreement is capped at $2 million. The loan bears interest at a rate of 1% over the Bank of Montreal’s prime rate, payable monthly, and is secured by the company’s principal shareholder with a movable hypothec in favor of the company on certain of DAVIDsTEA’s shares owned by Rainy Day Investments. The loan is repayable no later than December 31, 2019.', 'In closing, we’re excited to be significantly expanding our wholesale distribution in the coming months and with the availability of DAVIDsTEA sachets in over 2,500 stores across Canada. Furthermore, in the weeks ahead, we’ll be launching several exciting tea collections, including a new and expanded wellness collection. I’m thrilled by what the leadership team has put in place and the plan for the upcoming months. While we continue to face some challenges, we’re taking tangible steps to reposition DAVIDsTEA as a growth company. We remain focused on improving our financial performance, and we’re taking concrete steps for the DAVIDsTEA brand to better resonate with new and existing customers.', 'This concludes our remarks.

Our first quarter net sales performance included encouraging improvement in North America Retail and strong growth in our Pet segment, driven by good innovation and effective brand-building investment. We got off to a slower start in our other segments, and we expect topline improvement in those segments and for the Company starting in the second quarter.', 'On the bottom line, we delivered profit and earnings growth ahead of our expectations while continuing to invest in our brands and our capabilities. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2020 goals, including accelerating our organic sales growth, maintaining our strong margins and reducing leverage.', 'Slide 5 summarizes our first quarter financial results. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 2%. Organic net sales declined 1% with lower volume, partially offset by a positive price mix across all operating segments.', \"Adjusted operating profit grew 7% in constant currency driven by a one-time purchase accounting adjustment in the Pet segment in last year's first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.79 and grew 13% in constant currency, driven by higher profits and below the line favorability.\", 'As a reminder, we outlined three key fiscal 2020 priorities on our Q4 earnings call. First, we will accelerate our organic sales growth. We are working to improve growth in North America Retail by maintaining momentum on Cereal and improving U.S. Yogurt and U.S. Snacks.', \"We are also focused on driving another year of strong growth on Blue Buffalo. We delivered solid results for these segments in the first quarter. The results in our remaining three segments were below our expectations. In a few moments, I'll share how we'll step up the Company's organic growth rate starting in Q2.\", 'Our second priority is to maintain our strong margins and we delivered positive results here in Q1. And our final priority for 2020 is to maintain a disciplined focus on cash to achieve our fiscal 2020 leverage target and we had a good start to the year on this measure as well.', \"With these priorities in mind, I'll cover our Q1 segment results in detail with a particular focus on the topline before turning it over to Don to review our performance on margins and cash flow.\", 'Turning to the components of net sales growth on Slide 7. Organic net sales were down 1% from a year-ago, driven by lower volume, partially offset by a positive price mix across all five segments. Foreign exchange was a one-point drag in the quarter.', 'First quarter organic sales for North America Retail were flat, compared to the prior year, which was a two-point improvement on our fourth quarter trend, and we delivered net sales improvement across most of our operating units.', \"In U.S. Cereal, we maintained our positive momentum with net sales up 1%. We saw early traction in U.S. Snacks with net sales down to 1% compared to a 4% decline in fiscal 2019. U.S. Yogurt net sales were flat to last year and I'm happy to say that our strategic revenue management actions drove one-point of positive price mix.\", 'Constant Currency segment operating profit increased 2% in the first quarter, driven by benefits from HMM cost-savings and positive price mix, partially offset by input cost inflation and higher brand-building investments. Our in-market performance in North America Retail also stepped up in Q1.', \"As you can see on Slide 9, we've driven a steady improvement in our two-year retail sales trends since fiscal 2017. In the first quarter, our U.S. Nielsen-measured retail sales were flat versus a year-ago and we held or grew share in five of our 10 largest categories including Cereal, Refrigerated Dough, and Soup. We know we still have room to improve including some key categories like Yogurt and Snacks, and we'll continue to focus there to strengthen our overall growth profile.\", \"Let's dive a bit deeper into our first quarter performance in North America Retail, starting with Cereal. We grew U.S. Cereal retail sales in fiscal 2018 and 2019 and our results accelerated in the first quarter with retail sales up 1%. We outpaced the category, expanding our share of leadership position through increased investment behind compelling consumer ideas such as our Cheerios Heart Health Campaign and strong in-store execution and events.\", \"We also had another impressive quarter on innovation with the top five new products in the category including Blueberry Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Churros. I am very pleased by our performance in U.S. Cereal and I'm excited about the plans we have for the rest of the year to continue our momentum. We are executing well on the fundamentals of innovation and brand-building and we'll continue to drive these levers in the rest of the year.\", 'Last year, we improved U.S. Yogurt retail sales behind our strategy to expand in the faster-growing segments of the category and to support our core with brand-building investment and on-trend equity news.', \"In fiscal 2020, we'll continue to improve U.S. Yogurt with a strong lineup of innovation, brand-building and product news. Through the first three months of the year, yogurt retail sales were down 2%. We drove retail sales growth on the core with Original Style Yoplait flat to last year and Go-GURT up 13% due to increased distribution on Go-GURT Dunkers and Go-GURT Simply as well as strong back-to-school merchandising.\", 'The Simply Better segment, which now represents 12% of the category, continues to be an attractive growth space. We drove 8% retail sales growth on our products in this segment behind our better-tasting YQ product reformulation, which now prominently features the protein benefit on the updated packaging. And we launched into a growing beverage segment with our new Yoplait Smoothies. In total, we like the news and innovation we are bringing to the U.S. Yogurt category this year to drive further improvement in our retail sales trends.', \"Turning to U.S. Snacks. We have a long track record of growth on this business. However, fiscal 2019 was certainly a more challenging year. In fiscal 2020, we're focused on improving our performance behind innovation, renovation, brand-building support, and in-store execution.\", 'In the first quarter, retail sales were down 2% cutting our fourth quarter declines in half. Retail sales trends for Nature Valley improved each month during Q1, driven by positive results of our wafer bar innovation and a stronger back-to-school merchandising season.', \"Retail sales for Fiber One have also improved each month since we reformulated the product line to be more relevant for modern weight managers. While we still have distribution losses from earlier this calendar year, our gross returns per point of distribution have stepped up in recent months. For the remainder of the year, we'll continue to execute our F 2020 plans on bars and we expect to see continued retail sales improvement.\", 'We are focused on competing effectively everywhere we play, including our profitable $4 billion U.S. Meals & Baking operating unit. First quarter retail sales for Old El Paso grew 5% due to increased distribution, consumer news and merchandising as well as price realization across channels.', 'We returned soup to both retail sales and share growth in the first quarter. We drove retail sales up 2% due to a broad-based strength in the soup portfolio and we have solid plans in place for the upcoming soup season.', 'We had a great year on our refrigerated dough in fiscal 2019 and that performance has continued into this year. First quarter retail sales were up 2% and market share increased by a full point driven by distribution gains and in-store execution behind innovation.', 'In total, we are off to a good start on these businesses, and we think we’ll step up to have a successful year on U.S. Meals & Baking. Overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results in North America Retail and we are focused on the right priorities to improve organic sales growth in fiscal 2020.', \"Shifting gears to Pet. I am pleased to say that we had a great first quarter with net sales up 7%. This includes lapping an extra week of reported results in last year's first quarter. Excluding this timing difference, net sales were up in the mid-teens. Our growth was led by our expansion into the food, drug and mass channel, and we generated seven-points of positive price mix in the quarter.\", \"Looking at in-market performance, we drove all-channel retail sales up low double-digits, and we grew share again in the quarter. First quarter segment operating profit totaled $81 million, compared to $14 million a year-ago, driven by the $53 million purchase accounting adjustment in last year's Q1 as well as higher net sales this quarter.\", \"On Slide 15, you can see how the key components of our double-digit retail sales growth breakout by channel. Retail sales were up more than 100% in the food, drug and mass channel as we benefited from our expansion to new customers and the launch of Wilderness in food, drug and mass in last year's fourth quarter.\", 'Importantly, retail sales for food, drug and mass customers who have carried BLUE more than 12 months were up 50% versus last year. As we expected, retail sales and pet specialty continued to decline by double-digits. This is an important channel for BLUE and we continue to support the channel through unique programs and innovation.', \"For example, in the second quarter, we're launching CARNIVORA, a new super premium offering for pets exclusively into the pet specialty channel. We also have plans to execute exclusive programs in this channel later this year, including our new Baby Blue program, which we'll tell you more about next quarter.\", 'And BLUE continues to win in the rapidly evolving e-commerce channel with retail sales up 20% in the quarter, resulting in further market share gains. We remain on track to deliver 8% to 10% like-for-like growth for our Pet segment this year.', \"We're also focused on a successful leadership transition as Billy Bishop moves into a Founder and Brand Advisor role in January; and Bethany Quam, currently President of our Europe and Australia segment assumes day-to-day management of the Pet segment. We remain confident in this business and are excited about the growth prospects ahead.\", 'In the Convenience and Foodservice segment, organic sales were down 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by lower bakery flour volume and the negative impact of flour index pricing, both of which resulted from a decline in an underlying wheat prices during the quarter.', 'Despite near-term pressure from flour, we continue to drive good growth on our higher margin Focus 6 platforms. Net sales for these platforms were up 2% in the first quarter, driven by strong performance in the K-12 schools, including our new two-ounce equivalent grain cereals and our bulk Yoplait yogurt. Segment operating profit in Q1 declined 6% from year-ago levels that were up 14%.', 'In Europe and Australia, organic sales declined 5% due primarily to a challenging retail environment in France impacting yogurt and ice cream, where we were unable to secure agreements with some key accounts on inflation-driven price advances resulting in loss distribution.', 'Additionally, we had a headwind in the UK and France driven by changes in merchandising timing. On a positive note, we drove good retail sales growth on snack bars and Old El Paso behind innovation and consumer news.', 'First quarter segment operating profit decreased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by the timing of brand-building expense and lower volume, partially offset by positive price mix.', 'In Asia and Latin America, organic sales declined 3%. Sales in our three key emerging markets Brazil, India, and China fell short of our expectations in the quarter. In Brazil, we saw retailers draw down inventories early in the quarter.', 'In India, we changed our route to market to focus on more strategic and profitable distribution. And in China, we saw lower volumes on Häagen-Dazs due to slower consumer traffic in shops and on Wanchai Ferry the pricing actions we implemented to cover significant pork inflation.', 'First quarter segment operating profit in Asia and Latin America totaled $10 million, down $2 million versus a year-ago primarily due to lower net sales. Looking ahead, we expect to drive improved organic sales trends for the Company beginning in Q2.', \"Slide 19 summarizes our key focus areas by segment. In North America Retail, we'll continue to focus on maintaining momentum in U.S. Cereal while improving U.S. Yogurt and Snacks.\", \"In Pet, we'll continue to drive strong retail sales growth in the food, drug and mass and e-commerce channels, and we’ll execute exclusive innovation and programs in Pet specialty. In the remaining three segments, we'll see acceleration in our organic sales growth starting in Q2.\", \"In Convenience and Foodservice, improvement will be led by our Focus 6 platforms, where we'll benefit from strong innovation in Schools and Convenience Stores. We also expect bakery flour volume will improve, that we continue to expect index pricing on flour, which is profit neutral to be a drag on net sales.\", \"In Europe and Australia, we'll benefit from increased merchandising and we'll continue to drive strong performance on snack bars and Old El Paso. We'll also lap the impact of our distribution loss on Häagen-Dazs in the second half of the year.\", 'In Asia and Latin America, the retail inventory in Brazil and distribution headwinds in India that we experienced in Q1 are largely behind us, and we expect to see improvement in the second quarter driven by new strategic revenue management actions and increased levels of innovation from Häagen-Dazs cones in Asia, Betty Crocker ready-to-eat snacks in the Middle East and new spicy dumplings in China.', \"With that, I'll turn it over to Don to review our Q1 performance on margins and cash flow. Don?\", 'Donal Mulligan', 'Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 21 by summarizing our joint venture results in the quarter. CPW posted topline growth for the fourth consecutive quarter with constant currency net sales up 2%. CPWs growth was broad-based with continued momentum in the UK, Australia and the Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, as well as a return to growth in Latin America.', \"Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales grew 6% in constant currency driven primarily by growth in core minicups and a comparison to a double-digit decline in last year's Q1. First quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $22 million, compared to $18 million a year-ago, driven by lower restructuring charges at CPW and higher net sales, partially offset by higher brand-building expenses.\", \"Turning to total company margins on Slide 22. First quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were up 160 basis points and 130 basis points respectively, driven by benefits from positive price mix in all segments and last year's $53 million purchase accounting inventory adjustment in the Pet segment.\", 'Input cost inflation and Holistic Margin Management cost savings were largely offsetting in Q1. And for the full-year, we continue to expect input cost inflation in HMM to be 4% of cost of goods.', 'Slide 23 summarizes other noteworthy Q1 income statement items. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $22 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $15 million, driven by lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to 22.7% a year-ago, driven by international discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2020. In Q1, average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%.', \"Slide 24 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights in the quarter. Our core working capital totaled $624 million, down 7% versus last year's first quarter, driven by continued improvements in accounts payable.\", \"First quarter cash flow from operations was $572 million, down 6% from last year, driven largely by slower core working capital reduction versus last year's Q1, partially offset by higher net earnings. Capital investments totaled $70 million and we paid $298 million in dividends in the quarter.\", 'As detailed on Slide 25, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance. We expect organic net sales to increase 1% to 2%. With an updated view on foreign currency, we now expect the combination of currency translation, the impact of divestitures executed in fiscal 2019 and contributions from the 53 week in fiscal 2020 to increase reported net sales by approximately 1%.', 'Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2% to 4%. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to increase 3% to 5% from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019. We currently estimate that foreign currency will be immaterial to adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.', 'We continue to target free cash flow conversion of at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings and we remain on track to achieve our leverage goal of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of the fiscal year.', \"Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff for some closing comments.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Thanks, Don. And before we close, let me add a little bit more color on our Q1 results relative to our expectations. We feel very good about our performance in North America Retail and in Pet, where our Q1 organic sales results were modestly ahead of our expectations.', 'For our other three segments, we expected coming into the year that Q1 will be the slowest quarter of growth driven in part by the fact that we were lapping our strongest quarter of growth for each of these segments last year.', 'Our Q1 results in these segments were a bit below our expectations, largely driven by the shortfall in flour and Convenience and Foodservice and the retail inventory reduction in Brazil. We had expected and continue to expect to see growth ramp up in these segments starting in Q2, driven by the factors I mentioned a moment ago.', 'On the bottom line, our Q1 profit and earnings per share results were ahead of our expectations, and based on those Q1 results and our plans for the remainder of the year, I am pleased to say that we remain on track to deliver our full-year fiscal 2020 goals.', 'With that, let me open up the line for questions. Operator, can you please get us started?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Please proceed.', 'Andrew Lazar', 'Hi. Good morning, everybody.', 'Donal Mulligan', 'Good morning.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Good morning, Andrew.', 'Andrew Lazar', 'Hey. I guess, first off with organic sales in fiscal 1Q, particularly in the three segments, you talked about a bit below expectations. I guess in order to get back to your own sort of original internal plan for the year, would you expect that to come from really more a recovery in the international and CS&F segments? Or anticipating North America Retail and Pet need to maybe bear a little bit more of the weight around accelerating than initially planned?', 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"So Andrew, the first thing I would say is that we – we did reiterate guidance for the full-year of 1% to 2% growth, and we feel good about that because as I said, primarily the two things that we're different than what we expected were flour index pricing on the flour and retail inventory in Brazil.\", \"And the retail inventory in Brazil, we think we'll correct itself starting in the second quarter, which leaves the retail flour piece, the index pricing on flour really the biggest difference versus expectations.\", \"As we head into the rest of the year, we fully expect without giving guidance on each and every segment, we fully expect that the segments that were below our expectations will improve significantly in the second quarter. And I would say we've got good momentum on Pet and we've got good momentum on North America Retail, which are our most profitable businesses, and I don't see any reason why that momentum shouldn't continue into the second quarter as well.\", 'Andrew Lazar', \"Got it. And that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just lastly would be, I think in fiscal 2019, you had mentioned that about in North America Retail and maybe this is best for Jon. I think seven of 10 categories held or gain share. I think this quarter it was five of 10. I know that can move around probably quarter-by-quarter, but anything to read into that that we need to think about as we go forward through the year? Thanks so much.\", 'Jonathon Nudi', \"Yes. Hi, Andrew. I guess, overall, I'd say the short answer is no. We feel really good about the trajectory of our business. At our Investor Day, we said we wanted to do three things. One is continue our momentum on the Cereal and we did that in Q1, up 1%. We feel really good about that.\", \"And then we wanted to improve our performance in Snack Bars and Yogurt, and we were able to accomplish that as well. So again, we feel very much like we are on track again quarter-to-quarter, you have some levels and share, but overall, we feel like we're performing well and are on track for what we expect for the year.\", 'Andrew Lazar', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'John Baumgartner', 'Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jon, just looking at the narrowed gap between shipments and takeaway in North America in the quarter, I think the outlook for fiscal 2020 was that you continue to see retailer destocking. So are you seeing anything there improving a bit sooner than expected? Or are there any discrete benefits in terms of Q1 shipments that may be reverse or moderate going forward.', 'Jonathon Nudi', \"Hi, John. As we mentioned in fiscal 2019, we saw about a point gap between RNS and Nielsen, really driven by retailers focusing on reducing the working capital and inventories. We expect that to continue. It's not readily apparent, but due to rounding, we still saw about a half point gap in Q1 between RNS and movement. And we do expect to see a gap throughout the year, and again, we'll have to see how much that is as the year plays out.\", 'John Baumgartner', \"Okay. And then just a follow-up on U.S. Yogurt. One pillar to that strategy is stabilizing Yoplait Light. I mean, you're still cycling through some pretty big year-on-year distribution losses there. It's been flat sequentially I guess since January. I'm curious, looking at the recovery in Go-GURT, which also went through distribution losses, you’re back to mid single-digit growth there. Do you have a sense of confidence that maybe once you get into the back half of fiscal 2020, Yoplait Light does begin to at least stabilize back to the dollar growth overall? I mean is that kind of finding the bottom for distribution at this point?\", 'Jonathon Nudi', \"Again, the short answer I think is yes. And as we look at our business, our biggest business, our Original Style Yoplait, the Red Cup, and that was flat, actually grew slightly in Q1. And then Go-GURT is a really important kid business for us as well. So we'd say that's the core.\", \"The tail is really Light and Greek. And Greek, for all intents and purposes, has very little comp left there. And then Light, we do believe it’s stabilizing and we've got some marketing that we're going to be rolling up throughout the year that we think can improve that.\", \"But if you look at the Yogurt business, I would actually focus on, again Original Style Yoplait and Go-GURT, and then the Simply Better segment, which is where we think the category is going. 12% of the category today, I think like Oui and YQ, it's growing double-digits and we're the share leader, and we continue to introduce new products into that segment as well.\", 'So we feel good about our plans for yogurt. Again, coming out at Investor Day, we said we wanted to improve half of that down two in fiscal 2019. We were able to do that in Q1 and feel like we have good plans in place to move forward.', 'John Baumgartner', 'Great. Thank you for your time.', 'Jonathon Nudi', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Kenneth Goldman', \"Hi. Good morning and thank you. I wanted to ask two questions. Number one, in terms of organic volume, I know you don't want to be too specific on quarters, but you did talk about the second quarter, getting a little bit better. You do have an easier comparison, there are some better factors as you mentioned in terms of Brazil and so forth. Is it reasonable for us to model in at least flat organic volume as you see it in the second quarter now? Or is it a little bit optimistic?\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Yes. I think that we're certainly going to get better on organic volume and you'll see the biggest change in that and actually in Convenience and Foodservice because flour is pretty heavy and we lost a lot of volume in Convenience and Foodservice.\", \"And so as we get our pricing back in line and we share innovation kicking in Convenience and Foodservice, actually you’ll see a pretty good volume gain there because we won't have as much of a negative drag from flour and we've got some good innovation in K-12 schools.\", 'Kenneth Goldman', 'Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to ask, Jeff and Jon, you did talk about snacks getting a little bit better from a percent basis, but if you look at the comparison, look at the two-year, it did actually worsen a little bit from the fourth quarter of 2019.', \"I'm just curious, when can we think about a real turnaround in snacking when the absolute dollars start to rise and we start seeing legitimate improvement there because it feels like the improvement this quarter perhaps was just on an easier comparison a little bit.\", 'Jonathon Nudi', 'Yes. So Ken, this is Jon. As you look at our snack business, it’s really three key businesses, the first the snack bars and I want to dig into that in a little bit more detail. The second one is fruit snacks, and the third is salty. And fruit salty had a good Q1 combined they grew year-over-year and we need to make sure that we continue that as we move forward.', \"If you remember, we had capacity constraints from fruit in fiscal 2019. We now have capacity, so we feel like we're going to accelerate on fruit as we move throughout the year. So we feel good about those businesses. I think the story is going to really be about snack bars.\", \"And as we've talked, it's really about Nature Valley and Fiber One. On the Nature Valley in fiscal 2019, our innovation wasn't where we need it to be and we missed the key back-to-school merchandising window.\", 'As you look at Q1 on Nature Valley, we had a very good back-to-school, in fact incremental and displays were up double-digits in the month of August. And our innovation is Krispy Kreme wafer bar, which is off to a really good start. So we saw sequential improvement month-by-month on Nature Valley, and we expect that to continue.', \"And Fiber One, that's been again a challenging business for us over the last three or four years with significant declines. We renovated the product in the spring, and are seeing some really encouraging results. So if you remember, we went to 70 calories on Fiber One Brownies, five grams net carbs, two grams of sugar and really get back in line with modern weight managers going from five Weight Watchers points to two, and the early results are quite encouraging.\", \"In fact, we've seen our turns from point of distribution up double-digits. Our distribution is down year-over-year, so that will be a bit of a drag. I think the inflection point from a distribution standpoint were really be the turn of the calendar year as we lap some significant distribution declines in both Nature Valley and Fiber One. So we are encouraged. We believe that we're very much on or maybe slightly ahead of where we expect it to be at this point on snacking and feel like we'll improve as we move throughout the year.\", 'Kenneth Goldman', 'Thank you. ', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.', 'David Palmer', 'Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on Pet. Just looking at the numbers that we see in Scanner Data and also looking at those statistics you had on the other channels, and wondering what you think we will be seeing in the coming quarters.', \"And we're seeing that SKU count going up a lot. ACV is going up a lot. And then you mentioned specialty is down double-digits, but you have some new offerings going there and then e-commerce. So could you give us a sense of what we're going to see throughout this fiscal year by channel and maybe the complexion of the growth? Thanks.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Yes. David, I think you will see us continue to grow in the food, drug and mass channel, especially through the second and the third quarter behind distribution build that we have on Life Protection Formula, so increased distribution there as well as the rollout of Wilderness across previously existing customers.', \"And we're really pleased to see in the food, drug and mass channel, we have year-over-year growth, which I think is really important. So not only have we gained distribution, but as consumers are starting to find it more in that channel, they're really going to Blue Buffalo. So we like the growth we see in food, drug and mass and certainly over the next couple of quarters, we see continued growth in that channel.\", \"In the Pet specialty channel, as you noted, we had double-digit declines in the first quarter. We certainly think that will probably still decline in those channels over the coming quarters. We will hope we'll get a little bit better. As you can see, we've got some innovation and things like CARNIVORA and like Baby Blue. We're still lapping some distribution losses, but we're starting to see some traction on some of our innovation and some of our marketing ideas.\", \"And so as we go throughout the year, we would certainly expect for that channel will get a little bit better. And then with e-commerce, we feel good about what we're doing in e-commerce. I think I mentioned at the end of last year that the e-commerce channel for Pet had slowed a little bit, but we would see an increase in this coming year we thought. And that's exactly what we're saying and our performance is good in e-commerce. So we have a high degree of confidence that will continue to grow and be the market leader in the e-commerce channel.\", 'Donal Mulligan', \"And the only thing I would add to that is that as you recall at our Investor Day, we talked about the calendar differences in Pet this year. So we had a one-week drag in the first quarter that Jeff alluded to in our comments and then we'll have a one-month addition in the fourth quarter, we'll also then be lapping the rollout to Walmart in the beginning of the Wilderness expansion. So as we said in the Investor Day, we expect Q2 and Q3 to be our strongest organic growth quarters, ex the calendar changes.\", 'David Palmer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Laurent Grandet', 'Hey. Good morning, Jeff and Don. Thanks for the opportunity. So let me first focus on the other segments. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned you’re off to a slower start and that you were taking action to address topline improvement in second quarter. I know you alluded to some of those in your comments, but could you please elaborate a bit more on those three different subsegments? And I will have a second question, please.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"So we'll go around. In Europe and Australia, what will improve in the second quarter is that, we will return to our increased merchandising levels because we really had lower merchandising levels in the first quarter, vis-a-vis a year-ago. And so we had our strongest quarter of the year last year in Europe and Australia, and it was driven by two things, a strong ice cream season and higher merchandising levels.\", \"We’ll return to higher merchandising levels in the second quarter. So we have a high degree of confidence in the UK and France to our biggest markets, our performance is going to improve. We'll still be lapping some distribution losses on Häagen-Dazs, so it won't get all the way to bright, but it will improve significantly.\", 'In Asia and Latin America, the biggest thing that will change is going to be the trajectory in Brazil. What we thought going into the year that our – that retail inventories would climb in the first quarter because last year we had a trucker strike as you may or may not recall.', \"It's materializing later than we had anticipated. And we'll see that pickup in the second quarter of this year. In fact, we've already started to see it. And so Brazil will be the biggest change. Here, we've mentioned India, that in India, we pulled back on some distribution in the first quarter. We were planning on doing it. We pulled back faster than we thought. And what we see in the first quarter, it makes it for a tough first quarter. It should make our second quarter better because we've already taken that distribution out.\", \"And then in Convenience and Foodservice, we certainly have a lot of confidence in that business. And we've been growing that business over the last year or two. We'll pick back up in the second quarter. It really is a matter – you can see our Focus 6 grew 2%. That becomes a bigger part of our portfolio as kids go back-to-school and our K12 business is strong, and we've got great innovation there. And we've adjusted our flour pricing, so that will be less of a drag. And so we have a high degree of confidence that we'll return to momentum in our Convenience and Foodservice business.\", 'Laurent Grandet', 'Thanks, Jeff. Very helpful. The second question is – and Don, no disrespect to your retirement announcement, but one of the major events during the quarter was the announcement of Billy Bishop moving to an advisory role.', 'Donal Mulligan', '[Indiscernible]', 'Laurent Grandet', 'Lots of questions about this from investors. I mean could you give us a bit more comfort that this transition would be as smooth as it can be? And explain a bit further the role of adviser that Billy will take.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"So I think it's a fair question, commentary on Don not included. I thought, I think for Billy, Billy and I have been talking about this for quite a while, this transition. So this is not a surprise transition for us. We had talked about the timing many months ago. And one of the first I'd tell you, one of the things it allowed us to do is to get what I consider to be a great backfill in for Billy. And Bethany Quam, who's a terrific brand builder and knows the sales channel and marketing and really helped us get back on track in C&F a few years ago. And so it allows – who I think is a – someone great back in place.\", \"The other thing I would tell you – it's interesting. When we decided to buy Blue Buffalo, when I first met Billy almost two years ago, there are a few things that made this seem like attractive opportunity. One was the growth space of Pet and the growth of natural and organic. But beyond that, when Bill and I talked, it was interesting how similar the cultures of Blue Buffalo were to General Mills, and also how their strategy for growth parallel our strategy for growth. And how they think about brand-building is very similar to ours. And so the underpinning of that hasn't changed with the new leader coming in. \", \"And the growth strategy that Billy has outlined is one that we very much believe in and we believed in before we bought Blue Buffalo. And so – and the way they built the Blue Buffalo brand, when they think about their brand is the same way we think about building our brands, and the kind of leadership that Billy provided, we think that Bethany will provide. In terms of adviser, I'm excited to have Billy come onboard as well as to have Bill senior as well as their brother, Chris. And so the Bishops will still be in an advisory capacity, and they provide a lot of pet experience, a lot of marketing experience, a lot of new product experience.\", \"And this advisory role is nothing new for us. Gene Kahn stayed on for an adviser for many years on the Cascadian Farms in lower America and LARABAR. And so this role of adviser, especially a founder's, is really important. They provide a lot of legacy knowledge about the business, and we're thrilled that Billy and his dad and brother are going to stay on in that capacity.\", 'Laurent Grandet', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed.', 'Jason English', \"Hey. Good morning, folks, and thank you for the question. So I want to delve into Pet a little bit more. We've heard that the Carnivora launches were reasonably well received by Petco and PetSmart, and it sounds like you're getting around four feet of space. A couple of questions on that: A, is that kind of consistent with your expectations? B, when will it hit? And you mentioned sort of a low double-digit retail sales offtake versus a mid single-digit underlying shipment. Was some of that delta, that spread the result of early shipments to the pipeline still ahead of that? And if you are getting four feet, can you give us some sort of context of proportionate to what you have now? Like how much incremental all-in space do you expect in that channel?\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"All right. So let me take those series of questions, Jason, and I'll try to hit all of them. In terms of Carnivora, we're excited about the launch. Most importantly, it really started shipping in August. And that's important because August in the Blue Buffalo calendar actually falls in Q2. So none of the Pet Specialty results that we just talked about for Q1 include Carnivora being in the marketplace. And so we'll – that's why as we think about Pet Specialty, our initiatives to improve the growth in that channel really start in Q2 and Carnivora is a piece of that.\", \"The growth expectations you talked about will certainly be consistent with what we would have in mind. We think they'll be incremental. It is certainly accretive from a price per pound perspective because it is really premium priced even to Wilderness. So to the extent that there is steal from other product lines, I mean it'll certainly be price accretive for General Mills.\", \"And there's one more question you had that I – Oh, shipments, the difference in shipments really and consumption is that it's really the extra week. So it's not necessarily inventory build. It's really the extra week because our – kind of our like-for-like sales were up mid-teens in terms of growth. And so the difference between that and retail and what we reported was really one extra week, and our shipments lined up pretty well with our external takeaway.\", 'Jason English', \"Got it. Okay. I'm tracking. That makes sense to me. And in terms of the margin profile for the business relatively healthy even absent the step-up, the lumpiness of the inventory step-up cost. Do you still – is that business, the profitability, still being burdened by the plant start-up expense? And could you remind us sort of the cadence to that start up and what sort of margin acceleration, we should see as you ramp capacity in this new facility?\", 'Donal Mulligan', \"Yes, we've largely through Q1 now digested the plant start-up costs. So the benefit of the new plant will begin coming through as you alluded to, we're pleased with the Q1 margin performance beyond just the step-up, just the increase of the lapping the inventory step-up charge from last year, we had nice flow through on the incremental sales that we saw on a like-for-like basis, and we expect that to continue for the year. We expect this business – and while we're talking, our business, to be – going to be actually most profitable segments. And I think you'll see that is the year unfolds.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"To build on Don's comment I think the other reason we saw good profitability in the first quarter was because of our pricing. I know there's been a lot of discussion on pricing and Pet, but we saw seven points of price mix and we saw all – kind of all sizes of our Pet products improve in pricing in the first quarter, and while we sold 85% more of the small bag. We sold 220% more of the larger bags and so the, as we look at it. Our price per unit was up I think 15% or something like that. So in addition to what Don talked about in terms of the plan start-up. We also saw good pricing in the first quarter.\", 'Jason English', \"Got it. Thank you very much guys. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Michael Lavery', 'Good morning. Thank you.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Good morning, Michael.', 'Donal Mulligan', 'Good morning.', 'Michael Lavery', \"Could you just dissect price mix a little bit further, obviously there is a bit of a lift from just better momentum on Blue Buffalo and some of what you just referenced, within that segment as well, but are there any trade promotion timing shifts or anything we should watch out for in terms of pacing. And then a separate from that, can you just dissect a little bit what the drivers – is it some of the more weight outs or list pricing, what are some of the mechanics of how you're building the good momentum you're getting there?\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Well, I would say. Let me start with an answer. I mean pricing in Pet is probably the most complicated ventures because there are so many different sizes and formats available. And so if I go too far on the weeds, I'm afraid we may lose everybody. But what I say is that as we look at, we did take list pricing last January. So we did see some list pricing, we also saw some positive mix by bringing wilderness in.\", 'And the other thing I mentioned our small sizes less than five pounds we actually, increased the price of that over the quarter by 15% and the price per pound is pretty high, and the small bags. And we sold a lot more of the larger bags the 10 pounds to 20 pounds and we increased the dollar sales a load by 220%, and the pricing of that was up 9%.', \"And so – and there are a whole lot of things going on. But I think that's why I read it back up to – we get seven points of price mix and total and some of it was less pricing and some of it is mix and we think we'll continue to see some pricing into the next quarter on less pricing and we'll see some more on the mix as well.\", 'Michael Lavery', \"And I apologize. That's very helpful color. Maybe I've worded it poorly. But I meant total company, with that being a piece. Can you just touch on some of the broader levers, just as far as the rest of portfolio?\", 'Donal Mulligan', \"Yes, Michael. This is Don. We continue to expect their price mix is going to be a positive contributor all year. Each of our segments have plans in place to drive price mix some through price, some through mix, some through a combination. I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, Jeff touched on some of the dynamics, you'll see in Pet.\", 'One of the things I would highlight is the other thing that we touched on was the shift in timing of our promotional activity in EU, particularly in the UK and France, which is going to shift more into Q2 and Q1 on a year-over-year basis, that would be the other thing that I would point to.', \"We also do not expect weak prices to rebound. So the drag that we saw for weak prices in the first quarter in C&F will continue to expect volume to improve at our flour, but not necessarily the pricing component. Some of the main other that I think you're going to see fairly consistent and positive pricing through the year, not certainly at the level of the Plus 3 we saw in the first quarter, but the full-year we still expect it to be positive.\", 'Michael Lavery', 'Okay. Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Robert Moskow', 'Hi, good morning.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Good morning, Robert.', 'Robert Moskow', \"Hi, there. I've just two questions, one is your share gains in breakfast cereal have been really impressive, the execution has been great. Should we expect tougher comparisons for the rest of the year in terms of market share gains for breakfast cereal just because you're lapping some launches or do you think that you can continue that momentum?\", 'And then second question is on Convenience and Foodservice, I get the impact of the flower, but your profits are down to in the quarter. And I was just wondering, I thought I remembered last year that you had taken pricing maybe ahead of inflation in your Convenience Store part of the business, and I thought that there was kind of a risk that, okay, at some point that pricing would have to come back down. Am I misinterpreting that? Or should we assume that your pricing in Convenience and Foodservice ex flour is still in line with inflation? Thanks.', 'Jonathon Nudi', \"HI. Rob. This is Jon. I'll take the U.S. Cereal question first. I would say we feel really, really good about our Cereal business in the U.S. we grew an absolute terms for the third consecutive quarter we've actually grown share for seven of the last eight quarters, and it's really behind very strong fundamentals starting with brand building, I tell you that we're more clear than ever on who are.\", \"Core consumers are for each of our brands, whether that be your boomers for having that cereals where we're serving up cholesterol messaging and heart health; whether it's being on Reese's Puffs, collaborating with Travis Scott, or finally, on Wheaties, doing things like partnering with Serena Williams and the U.S. Women's National Soccer team. I think our marketing is as strong as it's been for quite some time, and that's really driving our baselines.\", 'And then Jeff touched on the upfront remarks on innovation. We had five of the top six products in the category in fiscal 2019. And our innovation in fiscal 2020 is off to a good start with Blueberry Cheerios and Peanut Butter Chex. So we would expect to continue to perform well and we fully intend to continue to hold and grow our share leadership in the category.', 'Robert Moskow', 'Got it.', 'Donal Mulligan', \"And Rob, on C&F, your recollection is correct. We did – we start taking pricing at the end of our F 2018, we saw the benefit of that in our Q1 of F 2019 that's one of the contributors to the fact that we grew profit 14% last year, it would be top line 4% and the bottom line is 14%.\", 'And set pricing – the pricing has held we are lapping it though. But we did have positive two points of price mix in Q1, which is a reflection of the fact that pricing has held, and we continue to expect with food service to have positive price mix for the full year.', 'Robert Moskow', \"Okay. So we shouldn't expect kind of a give back on profits as a result of that. It's like you've taken the pricing you've held it and you're now in line with your inflation?\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Yes. That's correct. We just in Q1, it was just lapping the initial – initial in case of the price increase.\", 'Robert Moskow', 'Got it. Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Alexia Howard', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Good morning.', 'Alexia Howard', 'All right. So just a couple of quick questions here, firstly on pets. I think one of the larger players, talked about increasing competitive – increasingly competitive pricing in the Pet Specialty channel, particularly around trial-sized bags.', \"Is that something that you saw? Or is it really just not something that particularly directly in competition with you clearly you've managed to take pricing and mixed up kind of across the board.\", \"But I'm just curious about those competitive dynamics in there. And then sticking with pet are you able to make any preparations for the likely increase in meat prices next year because of African swine fever? Or do you believed that your mix of meat is likely to mean that you're really not that exposed to that potential increase in input costs? Thank you very much and I'll pass it on.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Yes. So, Alexia, on the pricing, first, I would say from a macro perspective, kind of starting with consumer, you don't win in the Pet segment by taking prices down. You win in the Pet segment by delivering what parents are looking for, which is one of the reasons why private label is so low in Pet.\", \"People are looking to feed their pets, the best quality product and we think in many cases that's Blue Buffalo. So that's kind of our starting philosophy. In terms of the small sizes, I can understand the commentary because our small sizes were – by maybe one of our competitors, because our small size, growth was up 85% in the food, drug and mass channel. But our growth overall was up 137%. And the – our small sizes are still in many cases are 100% premium to our largest competitor, so they're still premium priced.\", \"And the prices in the first quarter on the small sizes were actually up double-digits on a price per pound basis. So when I look at it. Yes, we have more small sizes, but that's because we were growing more quickly in a new channel. It is certainly not our intention and it didn't manifest itself in the first quarter that we're going to be more competitive on price.\", \"And I think that's why I spent some time also referencing the price mix for us was up 7%, so in terms of being more competitive. I suppose, if you consider that we entered pretty, pretty forcefully into a new channel. Yes, it's more competitive in that sense, but on a pricing sense actually no.\", 'Alexia Howard', 'Great. And on the African swine fever?', 'Donal Mulligan', \"Yes. To the extent that – we're not going to give a forecast for next year's inflation, we'll take that into consideration as we're building the plan for next year. To the extent that we see inflation, we would have cost actions are pricing actions to offset it.\", 'Alexia Howard', \"Okay, great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Kenneth Zaslow', 'Hey, good morning everyone.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Good morning.', 'Kenneth Zaslow', \"Are there any more initiatives? Or what's the runway on HMM? You don't talk as much about that as you used to, so I'm just trying to figure out, I know it's a consistent cost savings opportunity, but is there incremental opportunity. Is it still going at the same pace? Can you just give a little bit of parameters around that? And how much cost opportunities it will be, not just for this year, but going forward?\", 'Donal Mulligan', 'Yes, Ken. Thanks for raising it. HMM is certainly one of our, I think, our key capabilities, and one that sometimes we take for granted. So I appreciate you raising it, because it is a strong contributor to our profit picture again it will be roughly 4% of our COGS this year, fully offsetting what is a bit of an elevated inflation period.', 'As you will know the kind of most recent new capability or aspect of global sourcing of HMM that we implemented was our global sourcing. That continues to pay dividend, not only in our savings, but you saw it in our working capital as well with continued extension on our terms and accounts payable, so it has a double benefit for us.', 'And we continue to add new capabilities. And as those manifest themselves and we have line of sight to the incremental savings that are available, we will certainly be vocal about that externally. As you look today, we are very comfortable with 4% of sales or – 4% of COGS as a solid runway for our HMM initiatives.', 'Kenneth Zaslow', \"And then just my follow up is, can you talk a little bit about e-commerce? I didn't hear any details on that. I'm assuming it's still growing, but any sort of commentary on that would be helpful as well. I'll leave it there.\", 'Jonathon Nudi', \"So, Ken. This is Jon. Maybe I'll talk about North America Retail. We continue to see nice momentum in e-commerce it was up about 50% in Q1. In North America, we continue to over index online versus bricks and mortar as our capabilities are strong and again we're working hard to make sure we are top of the basket. And we feel like we've got great capabilities that are again helping us to be advanced in this space. Continues to grow nicely, we think we're well positioned.\", 'Kenneth Zaslow', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. The line is open. Please proceed.', 'Bryan Spillane', 'Hi, good morning everyone.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Bryan, good morning.', 'Bryan Spillane', \"Just one question from me I think at the top you talked a bit about just how in the first quarter, sales were a little below expectations for the reasons you cited in the places where you did, but actually profits running ahead of plan. So I guess could you talk a little bit about what's driving that.\", \"But I guess, more importantly, as we look through the rest of the year to the extent that profitability is running ahead of plan, would the bias be to spend that back especially given the success that you're having continuing the improvement especially in North American Retail? Is it just provide more flexibility in case stuff goes wrong? But just trying to get a sense of how we should interpret that?\", 'Donal Mulligan', \"Sure, Bryan. I'll do the full year first. And you think about the year, as we talked about in July, we expect our strong margins to be stable for the full year. There's a couple of factors to take into account. One is the purchase accounting adjustment, that was a Q1 plus. I talked about positive price, mix which will be a benefit all year.\", \"HMM and inflation will be largely offsetting through the year and our brand-building investment was up in Q1 and that will actually increase during the course of the year. So our strongest margins will be in Q1, largely because of the lapping the purchase accounting, but also because the brand building, while it was up, will increase during the course of the year. So that's why I think about the year how the margins are going to unfold.\", 'Bryan Spillane', \"Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up just in China, I think you made the mention about maybe slower traffic in the shops for I guess Häagen-Dazs in China. Just is there anything that we should be thinking about there in terms of just the macro environment getting slower, I think before you started the year you talked about maybe poor cost being up for Wanchai Ferry just a little bit more color on what's happening in China and just how we should think about that would be helpful? Thank you.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Sure. Yes, in China, the growth did slow in our shops in the first quarter and that's not – that was not unexpected because we have seen the economy slowing there. It's still growing. So when we say the growth has slowed it has shown but it is still growing, which I think is important. And we've adjusted some of our tactics for our Häagen-Dazs shops to drive more traffic starting in starting in the second quarter.\", \"And then on Wanchai Ferry we took prices at the end of last year because we saw the African swine fever and the pork prices go up. So we took some pricing, and we did so a little bit ahead of our competition. We've seen them starting to take pricing there.\", 'So as we head into the second quarter we see improvement in our Wanchai Ferry business. And so in China, we saw our business in China decline a little bit, but not really a lot behind our expectations because we saw these macro forces at play.', \"And so our ability to get our China business back to growth really doesn't depend on a change in the macro environment. It really realize on tactics we've taken to drive more consumers in store and on our competition catching up with us on pricing on Wanchai Ferry, which is why we have confidence that we can improve that business heading into the second quarter.\", 'Bryan Spillane', 'Great. Thanks, everyone.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"It's time for one more.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.', 'Steven Strycula', 'Hi, good morning, everybody.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Hi, Steve.', 'Donal Mulligan', 'Good morning.', 'Steven Strycula', \"So one quick question for Don, and then a follow-up. So on the gross margin piece Don, if we strip out the Blue Buffalo contribution is it right to think that gross margins were up roughly about 30 basis points in the first quarter on a like-for-like basis, and given the brand building that you're doing? Can you speak to what specifically it is throughout the balance of the year? And why that steps up? And should that mean that maybe the run rate for the balance of the year is closer to like flattish. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\", 'Donal Mulligan', \"Yes. That's the math is right on Q1. So the $53 million step-up in inventory rolling over is about 130 basis points, so it does account for most of the gross margin improvement. As the year unfolds we're going to – we're seeing a slight step up in our media, that will increase, we're also keen to build capabilities around data and analytics to get deeper in that area.\", \"I think we talked about that a little bit in July, we've built e-commerce capabilities, we continue to invest there. We can do invest in our strategic revenue management all around how we manage and drive decisions through data, and you'll continue to see those capabilities being invested behind as the year unfolds.\", 'Steven Strycula', 'Okay. And my follow-up for Jeff, so do we see that incremental spend for brand-building and data analytics. Is that going to be more SG&A? Or is that still, for accounting purpose, roll through COGS?', \"And then a strategic question is, the inventory drawdown that we're seeing in the U.S. is that at all tied to the evolution of click and collect, meaning how retailers are merchandising in their stores and inventorying them or just carrying fewer days on hand because of how click and collect impacts the business. Could you comment there? Thank you.\", 'Jeffrey Harmening', \"Yes. So on the brand-building side, I would say without getting into specific on where it goes on the line of the P&L, what we're talking about on brand building is not increase – is not increased price promotion, it really is brand building and whether we do that through our customers or whether we do that through some sort of a mass media as Jon Nudi highlighted, I think our North America Retail Marketing is really good right now, especially in Cereal, but even for some of our other businesses and on Pet.\", \"And so to the extent that we see an opportunity to improve our brand building behind things like Pet or Old El Paso or Cereal we'll continue to do that because we're seeing some pretty good returns and we like what we're doing. So I'm not going to get go line-by-line, but that's what we see. And then your second question…\", 'Steven Strycula', 'Inventory?', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'On inventory, you want to talk about that?', 'Jonathon Nudi', \"Yes, sure. So Steve, I'd say the inventory reduction is probably less tied to click-and-collect, but related to data analytics and just technology. I think our retailers have better tools now, it's really I understand how much the inventory, they need to have in the warehouse, as well as on the shelf, and they're leveraging that technology to bring down their inventories and still have good in-stock position. So again, I think its technology and data analytics, not necessarily click-and-collect.\", 'Steven Strycula', 'All right. Thank you.', 'Jeffrey Harmening', 'Okay. I think that gets us to full-time.

Please go ahead.', 'Robert Blum', 'Thank you so much, and thank all of you for joining us today to discuss the financial results for S&W Seed Company for fiscal year 2019 ended June 30, 2019.', 'With us on the call representing the company today are Mark Wong, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matthew Szot, Chief Financial Officer. At the conclusion of today’s prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for a question-and-answer session.', 'Before I begin with prepared remarks, we submit for the record the following statement. Statements made by the management team of S&W Seed Company during the course of this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, and such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.', 'Forward-looking statements describe future expectations, plans, results or strategies and are generally preceded by words such as may, future, plan or planned, will or should, expected, anticipates, draft, eventually or projected.

Mark?', 'Mark Wong', 'Thank you very much, and welcome everyone today to the call. Matt and I would like to use this opportunity to really recap 2019 and the progress that S&W made, which we think was important and substantial in that fiscal year that has just ended and that we’re reporting on today.', 'As you all know, who follow the company, we did a couple of really important and large transactions in 2019. The first in October of 2018 closing was acquisition of the Chromatin assets. Chromatin was a large, important company in the sorghum market in the U.S. and around the world.', 'In the top five, probably, we were able to acquire the company and all of its production assets, its production plants, its breeding germplasm, its breeding stations, the technology that they had in herbicide resistance in sorghum. And most importantly, sales and marketing organization and products that were ready to go-to-market in the next year, the 2020 S&W fiscal year. And we were able to do all of that at probably a $0.30 and the $1 kind of sales price versus what the assets have cost us, if we – if the company had not been in so much difficulty financially.', 'So that was a huge opportunity for us, which we were able to complete. It was a competitive process. So we had a big European company that we outbid for the asset. So we were very pleased to acquire those assets that I just summarized in the Chromatin acquisition.', 'In addition, we – I think we showed in 2019 that we were not just the guys who could buy things at the right price, but we were also people who understood how to sell things at a good price. And so our second transaction was a sale of alfalfa assets that we had acquired about five years ago for under $30 million. We sold those back to the original seller that we bought it from, now reorganized into Corteva. Corteva decided they wanted to be back in the alfalfa business.', 'So we cut the deal with them, where we basically kept the production plant again, and the research facilities and all of the germplasm, so that we could restart our alfalfa business in the Americas and in the rest of the world. And what we sold back to them was really the remaining production years on our contract and the profits that would have been earned from that and a couple of research selections out of our existing research program.', 'But there remains in that program plenty of new products for our own customers that will be different from the ones that Corteva is selling. And we basically sold them all of the inventory that they would need for the next three years. So the sum total value of that transaction was about $70 million, $25 million in inventory and $45 million for the license varieties and the production contract.', 'It just appears to me that, given that the markets – given the market’s valuation of the company that this was a tremendous sale by S&W, it allowed us to really finally get our debt paid off and give us some room in our balance sheet to make future acquisitions, which has always been our plan. And it left us also with all of the assets that we need to continue our alfalfa business all around the world, and it allowed us to focus our alfalfa business, at least, in the Americas through a much improved sales and marketing organization that was part of the acquisition.', 'So we were extremely pleased by both of those transactions, one, buying assets, one, selling assets. I just like to mention a third transaction that wasn’t done in the 2019 fiscal year, but we’ve announced it on August 30, 2019. We purchased the paid up – exclusive paid up license, a 15-year license for wheat varieties in Australia from Corteva. It was a program that seven or eight years old, probably has roughly $17 million invested in it. We acquired it for $2.6 million.', 'So, again, I think it shows our ability to recognize assets that have future value to S&W and acquired those at a very reasonable price. The Australian wheat market is very different than any other wheat market around the world. It’s about a 30 million acre market. So it’s really a large market. And there’s, what is known as endpoint royalty.', 'So the Australian government has organized the industry, so that seed companies that do proprietary breeding and create new wheat varieties are paid a royalty by the purchaser of that wheat grain at the elevator before the products are shipped either to the – internally to their final use within Australia or externally to other Asian countries, and about 70% of the wheat that is produced in Australia goes to other Asian countries around the world.', 'So we think it’s a great opportunity. We are – we acquired the rights to the three major varieties that Corteva has in the market, and so those royalties will be coming to us. And the – in the seed business, you have to be kind of patient. So, this deal took more than a year to finish.', 'We hired the wheat breeder, a guy who we really think highly of Nick Willey. In 2018, he’d been the wheat breeder in the program. And under S&W, he’s supervising that wheat breeding program, plus other research operations in Australia. But it took over a year, and we’re super pleased with how it all turned out. And we’re happy with the deal we got and we’re happy with the opportunity in the future that we think that wheat represents in Australia.', 'And given that the current political environment between the U.S. and China and these tariff wars that we all read about, which is very, very difficult on the ag sector in the Americas, especially in the USA proper. We think that sort of having assets outside of the U.S. and Australia with access to other Asian markets is a really good way for us to hedge against the future U.S.-China tariff issues that have not all been figured out yet between the U.S. and China.', 'But that – so that’s what I wanted to say on the three acquisitions – well, two acquisitions in the sale that we made. In 2019, again, I think it was a very, very important year for S&W. But acquisitions and buying or selling at the right price are one thing, but the important thing for any company is integration into the existing company of all of those new operations. So that the company is profitable, self-funding and can fund its own acquisitions in the future.', 'So that’s really the focus for the 2020 year is integration. We really think that our new focus on geographic markets like I’ve talked about in the last couple of calls, where we have Don Panter running all the Americas, that’s Canada, the U.S., Mexico, and then South America, Brazil, Argentina, the other important countries there.', 'And David Callachor, who are running our international operations, as far the Australian markets and our assets there and then our operations in South Africa are – with our JV partners and our operations in Asia, in Europe, and the Middle East, where we have separate salespeople responsible for all of those that report to David. We think that that’s just the right way to go.', 'We continue to believe that it focuses on the customer – on the customers’ needs. And it allows us to really fine tune our sales force and rebuild some of the investment that wasn’t made by Chromatin in that sales force and we basically are doing that. And if you look at our expenditure numbers, you’ll see that investing in sales and marketing is a big expense for 2020 for us and on purpose.', 'So, we’re supplying more information to customers all around the world, especially in the U.S.. We’re looking at our trialing program. We’re communicating with thousands of farmers and people in the dealer networks with eblast and through social media on our product offerings, our new products and our tried and true sort of important products from the past. That’s something that the company has not done before.', 'Remember, the company mainly sold through distributors before. And while we still sell through distributors internationally, now we have a couple of JVs internationally, where we’re able to reach down into the organization and distribution a little bit towards the farmer.', 'And then in the U.S. for sure, we are trying to build our farmer dealer network and our network to other distributors. So that we can have more market power, more influence over what our customers are actually buying, because they understand the quality of S&W products and they understand how S&W products perform in the farmers’ field against the products are – of our competitors.', 'So that’s really important. We think that that’s going well. We’re looking for roughly from our existing businesses, plus Chromatin, which now we consider an existing business after this year of integration about a 10% double-digit sort of unit growth rate. And we’re pretty happy that, that things are going well, especially given how tight and difficult the ag markets are around the world taking share from other people, because these markets aren’t really growing that much, is not an easy task, it’s a difficult thing to do.', 'I just like to talk a couple of minutes just about traits. So, traits are hugely profitable for seed companies. In looking at the the two traits that we’re developing, which is the digestibility trait in alfalfa with our partners Calyxt. Those product development process is going very well. We’ve developed markers, so that we can sort through all the alleles in our germplasm. We are in the process of putting out field testing to evaluate how more digestible our alfalfa varieties with this gene knockout are and we’re pretty happy with what we’ve seen so far.', 'In addition, we have a second trait, which I’ve mentioned, I think on our last call, which is a trait that we acquired in the Chromatin acquisition. It’s herbicide resistance in sorghum to a herbicide ACCAs. This herbicide is a grass herbicide, so how it’s used is, sorghum is a grass also, corn is a grass also. And in the case of sorghum, the problem is, wheats that our grass is growing when the sorghum plants are just emerging from the soil and the sorghum plants are very small and can’t compete really with some of the wheat population.', 'So farmers want to spray over the top with cold and farmer lingo of the sorghum crop and have this – the herbicide kill all of these weedy grasses, but not affect the sorghum. And so that’s what our herbicide tolerance does, our ACCAs tolerance. It allows – it’s a product that allows the farmer to spray over the top of our sorghum varieties with ACCAs herbicides to kill emerging grasses, but not affect the sorghum plant.', 'So ACCAs is a class of herbicides, it’s an old class of herbicides. That’s actually a good thing, because they’re relatively cheap versus some of the new herbicides. And the decision for the farmer is always, what is the cost of the gene in the sorghum, plus what he’s going to have to spend for his ACCAs herbicide. And is that cost reasonable, given what yield enhancement he can make by controlling the weeds and getting more sorghum grain for every acre that he plants.', 'And so we think, in our research trials that we have evaluated that and that it looks like a very positive economic benefits to the farmer that will allow us, obviously, to make a profit on our ACCAs tolerance, but gene, but it will also allow the farmers to make the profit on their increased yields of sorghum in the acres that they plant with our proprietary sorghum hybrids.', 'The level of resistance looks very good. We’ve done this before in prior companies that I’ve run, and we’re pretty happy with that. And our field trials are going well. We’re planning a fairly large field trial in many locations for – spring of 2020. So we’ll keep everybody aware in the next six or nine months of how those look, as they come out of the ground, and as we spray them with ACCAs herbicide and see how they react in the farmers’ field. So we’re pretty happy with all that.', 'So our two teams are really progressing well. We’re starting to talk to our partners, potential partners, obviously, with ACCAs. We need a herbicide partner, someone we’re going to partner with that’s going to supply the herbicides. So those discussions are ongoing. And we’re pretty excited about both of those gene opportunities, digestibility in alfalfa and herbicide resistance or tolerance in sorghum.', 'On the stevia front, we continue with our program. We, as you all know, we’ve transferred really the breeding part of the program to the southeast, where we think things are better under a new R&D head, Jeff Klingenberg, who we knew from prior relationships in other companies and who is a tried and experienced breeder, and he is moving the program forward.', 'Our beverage partner continues to be supporting the program and investing with us in moving these products forward. And we are in discussions with several other partners for the 2020 production season to see if there will be a crop we can put in the ground for them. And so that’s going well.', 'Basically, what our breeding program does, just to remind everybody is, there’s lots of different stevianoids within stevia that provide the sweetness. And so we’re taking those apart a little bit. There’s sort of 15 or so important ones and trying to figure out, which ones we can amplify in our breeding lines.', 'So that the ones that taste good, basically more of those are produced and the ones that maybe have a bitter taste or don’t combine as well in beverages or food products, we can minimize those. And so it’s a very efficient, but scientifically complicated program, not everyone could do it. And we’re very happy that Jeff Klingenberg has joined us. In that, he has the breeding expertise to really bring this program to successful completion.', 'So, that’s really what I wanted to say from operating standpoint. I wanted to remind everybody, what acquisitions and sales we sort of did in 2019. I wanted to remind everybody that traits are still important, that stevia is still important to us. But it’s the integration of those acquisitions and the opportunity that they offer to S&W, that is really the focus of S&W for 2020.', 'So we expect, as I said, a 10% unit growth in alfalfa and sorghum from our existing business. We have enough inventory to supply that kind of growth rate. We were pretty sure when we put the last crop out in the spring of 2019, that we would be producing enough to satisfy that demand.', 'We believe that our new traits are coming along well, digestibility in alfalfa and herbicide tolerance in sorghum. We think that our strength and balance sheet take some pressure off of us to be sort of quarter-to-quarter, but we still are trying to look at acquisitions. That’s a big part of what – of the company we want to build.', 'So buying things at a good price, getting us into new species, new geographic areas and doing it, so that we can integrate it into our existing operations is what our strategy is all about. And that’s what we continue to concentrate on.', 'So we’re hoping that 2010 will be another really good year for us – excuse me, 2020 will be another really good year for us like 2019 was and we’ve strengthened our management team. We’ve added quite a few new sales and marketing people. So we’re looking forward to a really excellent year in 2020 also.', 'So with that, I will turn the discussion over to Matt, who will go through the financial picture of S&W for 2019 and looking forward a bit. Matt, please.', 'Matthew Szot', 'Thank you, Mark, and thanks to everyone on the call today. We do have a quite a bit to cover given the new licensing agreement with Pioneer and its impact on not only the historical financials, but our go-forward expectations and guidance for 2020. I’m assuming everyone has access to the various financial statements that we put in our press release. So I’ll provide further color on some key topics.', 'So I’m going to get right to it. Revenue for fiscal 2019 was approximately $110 million, compared to $64 million in fiscal 2018. Now to break this down further, we recognized $34.2 million from the new Pioneer licensing agreement in fiscal 2019, $37.6 million from sale exceed the Pioneer under the legacy distribution and production agreements, and the remaining $38 million coming from our non-Pioneer, alfalfa, sorghum and sunflower operations.', 'As this last portion is really our core business going forward, we are referring to this as core revenue to help provide clarity of the business on a go-forward comparable basis. Core revenue of $38 million in fiscal 2019 increased nearly $13.3 million from fiscal 2018, which was primarily driven by the increases from the acquired Chromatin operation, as well as single-digit organic growth and the other aspect of our business.', 'Now given the trend of decreasing revenue from our organic operation during the last few years, we are certainly pleased with the transition we’ve made to once again delivering growth in our core business. More exciting, however, are the expectations we have for 2020. We’re going to be – we’re currently expecting growth in core revenues of 9% to 16%, and I’m going to dive into this further in a moment.', 'Now as we discussed during our May 23 conference call dedicated to discussing the revised Pioneer agreement, Pioneer paid us $45 million in cash upfront and we’ll make additional cash payments totaling $25 million between September 2019 and February 2021. So the total consideration from this transaction is $70 million.', 'The exact payment details will be highlighted in our Form 10-K. And as I just mentioned, $34.2 million of the foregoing amounts were reported as licensing revenue for fiscal 2019, with the remaining amounts of approximately $34 million will be recognized as revenue through February of 2021 as alfalfa seed is delivered to Pioneer.', 'Now of this $34 million of future revenue, we’re expecting approximately $22 million in fiscal 2020 and $12 million in revenue in fiscal 2021. These future sales to Pioneer will contribute approximately $11 million for the gross profits over the combined fiscal years of 2020 and 2021.', 'So as we look to fiscal 2020, excluding any acquisitions that we’re pursuing, we’re looking at core revenues of approximately $41 million to $44 million, which would represent organic growth of approximately 9% to 16% compared to the prior year. Including revenue contributions from Pioneer, we expect total revenue for fiscal 2020 to be in a range of $64 million to $67 million.', 'Now turning to gross margins. Total gross profit margins for fiscal 2019 were 37.1%, compared to 23% in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross profit margins was primarily due to the license agreement with Pioneer, partially offset by a lower cost for market adjustment made to inventory, whereby we wrote down $8.8 million of inventory. Now approximately $5 million of this inventory write-down is directly attributed to the Pioneer agreement. When you exclude the benefit of a license revenue and the write-down of inventory, gross margins would have been 20% for fiscal 2019.', 'Now as we look to 2020, we are expecting gross margins of approximately 25%. We are seeing strong pricing in our proprietary sorghum and sunflower programs and some continued softness in certain alfalfa seed markets. This dynamic can certainly reinforce the proactive moves we have taken to diversify our crop portfolio and transition towards higher-value traits, which command a much richer margin profile.', 'Now quickly on the operating expense line item. The $5.7 million increase in adjusted SG&A expense compared to 2018 was due to $2.1 million of additional expenses pertaining to Chromatin,, which was acquired in October, coupled with additional investments in our sales and marketing and product development functions, both of which we’ve discussed during the last few calls.', 'Now on R&D, consistent with what we’ve discussed over the last few quarters, we increased our investment in hybrid sorghum and sunflower R&D programs. And we expect our research and development spend for 2020 to increase as we continue to invest in these growth programs.', 'Now, given these recent events, I’d like to provide some more specific guidance for 2020 related to operating expenses. In summary, we expect SG&A to be approximately $19 million in fiscal 2020, which includes stock-based compensation of approximately $million.', 'We expect research and development to be approximately $8.2 million in 2020, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $5 million in 2020. Again, this excludes any potential acquisitions that we may enter into.', 'Now, as we anticipated as a result of the changes in our agreement with Pioneer, we did record an $11.9 million goodwill impairment charge and a $6 million intangible asset impairment charge during the fourth quarter. As of June 30, 2019, and as of today, we do not have any remaining goodwill record on the balance sheet.', 'Now adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 was $19.2 million, compared to $1 million in fiscal 2018. Again, the key driver here was the Pioneer lesson – licensing agreement.', 'As we talked about in some length, the new – well, the – yes, the new license agreement with Pioneer essentially accelerated the cash flow of our next five years minimal contractual obligations and further compensates S&A for the upfront licensing of certain varieties. The acceleration of this cash flow significantly improved our financial position, including fully paying down our U.S. revolving line of credit, giving us significant flexibility.', 'Now the recent transaction does create a near-term disconnect between our operating infrastructure and our revenue base, which we expect to result in negative EBITDA as we move into fiscal 2020. Without going into too many details, we are expecting a return to positive EBITDA in 2021, simply from our organic operations and that should give you a sense of the opportunities we believe are present in our core organic operations. If we complete the strategic of acquisitions available to us and leverage off of our existing platforms, we believe there’s significant opportunity in the coming periods.', 'Now a couple of quick items before I turn the call back over to Mark. As you can see from the balance sheet and in line with what we communicated on our May 23 call, we utilized the initial proceeds from the Pioneer agreement towards the pay down of our lines of credit. As of today, we had zero drawn on the U.S. line and $9 million drawn on our Australian line. These lines of credit remain in place with a significant amount of unused borrowing capacity, which will help fund our future growth initiatives.', 'Now I know I went through a lot of details here. So please feel free to ask any questions if there’s a need to clarify anything discussed.', 'With that being said, let me turn it back over to Mark.', 'Mark Wong', 'Thank you, Matt. So let me just summarize the call today. We’re looking for 2020 to be another spectacular year for S&W. We think that, as Matt has described, we’ve strengthened our balance sheet significantly and we removed some of the inventory risk in the sense that all of the dormant inventory has been sold as part of the transaction with Corteva.', 'We think that integration is going well. We are expecting, like I said, 10% – double-digit growth in alfalfa and sorghum for 2020. We think that our new organization, which focuses on local markets, so in the Americas, sorghum and alfalfa are the two most important crops. But internationally, David’s team is selling not only alfalfa and sorghum, but also sunflower and wheat.', 'And so are – we have one sales force selling all of those different species in each of the appropriate markets. It’s – we don’t have two sales forces out there. We have one sales force, one S&W sales force selling all of our products now. And we’re reaching out to our farmer and distribution customers to tell them that that’s what we’re doing and to show them what our breeding programs have produced in terms of performance in the farmers’ field of new hybrids and varieties for all of those crops.', 'We expect that there will be continued acquisition opportunity. The market – the ag markets are difficult and many companies are struggling. We are one of the few that are in acquisition mode. And we have more deal flow than we can deal that we could ever close. And we have a pretty good process to go through the companies who call us and throw out the ones that are obvious not matches, and then put in the time with the ones that may be potential matches to see if there’s deals to there. If there’s value for S&W that can be had at the price that the seller wants to sell at.', 'Again, most of our acquisitions, when we model them, we’re looking at mid-teens with kind of returns, internal rate of returns for our investment. And we think that, that kind of opportunity continues to be available given the difficulties in the ag markets. So we’re looking for 2020 to be another very good year for S&W. We thank all of our employees for the efforts that they made in 2019. It was a really big effort on everyone’s part. And we are looking forward to everyone working hard and smart again in 2020, and the rewards that will generate for us.', 'So with that, I’ll complete the call, and we will be happy to answer questions. And I will turn it over to the operator. Thank you so much.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sarkis Sherbetchyan of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Good morning, and thanks for taking my question here.', 'Mark Wong', 'Hey, Sarkis, good morning.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'So first just wanted to kind of understand for the current year for Chromatin, I think, the press release said $12.4 million of sales was realized. And I wanted to kind of understand how that compared to the previous guidance, the management team provided for $14 million to $15 million Was there some sales that are may be slipping into next year? Any kind of missed opportunity, just kind of help us understand the delta there?', 'Mark Wong', 'Matt, do you want to take that?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes. Sure. Mark. Sarkis, yes, so – we – the top line at Chromatin did come in a bit lower than we had expected. But that was really related to timing of sales, some of those sales actually shifted to July of 2019. And I do want to point out that although the top line was a bit softer, gross margins did come in better than expected.', 'So we were still able to generate positive EBITDA on that $12 million of revenue for Chromatin, which we think is something to be proud of considering the historical losses that the business generated. And it really just sort of, I think, demonstrates how powerful this business can be as we start driving top line revenue growth, particularly with the margin profile that these hybrid sorghums are delivering.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Thanks for that. And then with regards to that, I think, in the past you mentioned, call it, 30% gross margin maybe a little bit better. Can you give us a flavor on what you did generate?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes, Sarkis. The margins for the – our sorghum business came in around low-40% range, and we’re expecting that margin profile to continue into 2020. And as we look to the outer years, it probably increasing and improving from there.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Great. That’s good to learn. And then I think in prior calls, you mentioned for fiscal 2020, you’d expect the business for Chromatin and the sorghum assets to do $17 million to $20 million in annual sales. Is that still the expectation, or would there be a range that’s a little bit lower?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes, Sarkis, based on the revenue guidance we gave of $64 million to $67 million, we’re assuming that the Chromatin business would generate roughly $15 million of that. So certainly, if we get back to that $15 million or $20 million range, that would be upside to the revenue guidance we provided to date.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Got it. Good. And then with regards to the guidance given for the Pioneer licensing sales, can you maybe give us kind of the cadence we should expect for fiscal 2020? And then also how would that impact gross margin, right? Would it be kind of calling in below 30% range, or would it be 100% gross margin? Just kind of help us understand how we should think about the license as it flows through the P&L?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes. So, Sarkis, the license revenue was all recorded in 2019. The – we will be generating revenues to – for sale of seed to Pioneer in the 2020 and 2021 range. Were thinking that revenue will be roughly $22 million in 2020, with high sort of, say, 27% to 28% gross margins.', 'So as we deliver seed to them basically from now through February of 2021, we’ll be generating revenues pretty much consistent with our historical margin profile to Pioneer.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Okay.', 'Matthew Szot', 'Does that address your question?', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Yes. So the balance would be treated more like a product sale, and what we just saw was a license sale, is that correct?', 'Matthew Szot', 'That’s correct. That’s correct.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Okay. And that’s going to kind of be in line with the inventory to cash schedule that was previously disclosed in an 8-K?', 'Matthew Szot', 'That’s right, Sarkis.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Good. And then just finally, here, I know in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that some of the transactions kind of create a disconnect between the businesses operating expenses and revenues, right? And so even with kind of the the product sales that flow in for fiscal 2020 to Pioneer, you’re kind of guiding to negative EBITDA here. What’s the magnitude of the EBITDA loss? Is it a low single-digit EBITDA loss, like just kind of help us understand what we should be thinking?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes. Without any acquisitions, Sarkis, and this certainly is a short-term term [ph] but we’re thinking that our EBITDA loss will probably be in the $6 million to $8 million range based on the revenue guidance we’ve given. And obviously, we’re working hard to close that gap quickly, acquisitions will help. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the 2021 period, just from an organic base is a period of time where we think that these operations will flip back to positive EBITDA.', 'Sarkis Sherbetchyan', 'Great. That’s all for me. I’ll hop back in the queue.', 'Mark Wong', 'Yes, Sarkis, let me add something to what Matt said about the relatives, really, I think your question is, the relative weight of expenses versus sales. I mean, we moved all of those sales to Pioneer basically into 2019 with them, as Matt described, the remaining inventory sales in 2021. As seed company, you always are looking to cut expenses when you lose sales like that. But breeding programs are very difficult to start, stop and then restart.', 'And so, there is – to maintain consistency and to have a product pipeline, that is going to generate really competitive products in the marketplace that we can win share with. You’ve got to grit your teeth and buckle it up and keep spending that money in the short-term to have products in the intermediate term. And we understand that can be a bit distressing to some investors if they’re not looking far enough ahead. But that’s how the seed business works. And I’ve had 40 years of experience. I’ve tried cutting expenses too deep and suffered the consequences.', 'So, we’re cognizant of the fact that for 2020, we have negative EBITDA and we’re doing everything we can from integration standpoint through 2020 and 2021 to get back to a positive territory, and obviously, an acquisition will help. But we’re trying to inform the market about what our legacy business will do, because that’s really important that people understand what our performance looks like without an acquisition.', 'But we are looking at a couple of significant acquisitions. They will go add earnings to the company, they are accretive and they have IRRs that look incredibly attractive in this market. So, more on that when we close something. But we – these transactions take a long time, some of these things we’ve been working on for quite a while.', 'So, stay tuned for more input on the acquisition story. But really, 2020 is the year of integration, right? We’ve got to take the businesses that we’ve already purchased and integrate those into the traditional S&W platform and we’ve got to move the whole company forward. Without an acquisition, we’ve got to show the market that we can make money in the businesses that we have.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Klieve of National Securities Corporation. Please go ahead.', 'Mark Wong', 'Hey, Ben.', 'Ben Klieve', 'All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, guys. A few questions here. First of all, building off of Sarkis’ questions on Chromatin. Can you just kind of elaborate a bit on really where the business stands today versus where you’ve kind of thought it would be on prior earnings calls? It sounds like it certainly is still very much a positive acquisition for you, but that – it’s – just that the numbers are shifting around a bit. So can you just elaborate on where you think that delta is coming from? And why that delta is coming to be here?', 'Mark Wong', 'Yes, sure. I mean, Ben, a couple of million dollars is obviously important. We’re saying $15 million versus $17 million that we thought before. The acreage has changed, the market has changed, the sort of competitiveness of sorghum versus corn changes. I think, when every quarter that goes by, we have better information from our sales force, as to what’s really happening out there in the market.', 'So I wouldn’t read too much into being sort of on the low-end of that estimate that we made previously. Like Matt said, the margins are much better. We’re basically asking the market to pay for our improved varieties. We’re not trying to give them away. We’re not trying to buy share by cutting price.', 'And it’s important to teach the market that we believe we deserve the margin that we make, because our hybrids produce seed in the field that – compared with our competitors and they’re the best thing for them to buy. So we’re trying to set that mark in the market. And if sales are up and down a million or two, frankly, I don’t get too concerned about that.', 'Ben Klieve', 'Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Also here, so looking at the kind of outlook for 2020 and 2021, if I look at the organic catalyst that could take you from the EBITDA loss you described next year, all the way in a positive territory in 2021. The – my assumption here is that you believe that the lead products in your development pipeline may be able to transition to commercialization in 2021. Is that a fair timeline, or do you think those – do you think those kind of lead varieties are going to potentially be further out than that?', 'Mark Wong', 'No. I mean, we – with the Chromatin acquisition and with our own alfalfa breeding program that was originally the Pioneer program. I mean, it’s a continuous program, right? As is the wheat program in Australia, as is the sort of five years that we’ve got into sunflower, six years we’ve got into sunflower breeding. So, when you are able to maintain kind of stable funding of these programs, I think, we’re generating something like 15 – across all of those species 15 new products that are coming into the market on a worldwide basis.', 'So we’re optimistic that we’ve had trials of those. They look pretty good in the farmer’s field and we’re optimistic that they’re going to take some share. So this is hopefully the beginning of a steady market penetration gain on our part in these crops, that won’t be true in all markets. But in the important markets that we’re focused on, hopefully, that’s true.', 'So, the product development, life cycle is very long. I mean, you sort through, you make your crosses in the breeding blocks. You sort through the best material there. A lot of times, it’s fairly complicated genetics. And so having a marker, so that you can look for what you want in performance is important. And we use marker-assisted breeding in all of our crops, and then you’ve got to test in the field. You’ve got to increase seed amounts, so that you have something to sell, all that takes some time.', 'And so, from probably the time you make the first cross, even with the improvements in speed and breeding programs, it’s probably a seven-year timeline to get new products, bread trials and then seed increase. So when you see the 15 new product coming out from our operations, this is the culmination of lots and lots of years of work, and the beginning of our field pipeline. And so, I think people should be optimistic about what our future results are going to be for the next intermediate term.', 'Ben Klieve', 'Okay, perfect. Thanks, Mark. And last one for me. Regarding kind of the potential scale of future acquisitions, with the company as it is today, can you comment at all kind of the level of debt you guys feel comfortable with, any potential restrictions that you have from your debt facilities that would limit the size of any acquisitions? You’ve kind of averaged kind of roughly $40 million in debt over the last couple of years. Would you feel comfortable getting back to that, or we’re looking at a bit lower? Kind of help us kind of understand what you’re thinking about now in light of all the changes that have taken place in your company over the last couple of quarters?', 'Mark Wong', 'Matt, you want to do that, or you want me to try that?', 'Matthew Szot', 'Yes. No, Mark, I’ll take that and then maybe you can…', 'Mark Wong', 'Okay, sure.', 'Matthew Szot', '…chime in. So, Ben, each acquisition is going to have its own unique characteristics. And depending on the asset profile that comes along with each of those acquisitions is going to be a driving factor to how much balance sheet leverage we have.', 'I mean, I will say at this point in time, we don’t have anything drawn on our U.S. lines of credit. We have roughly $30 million of unused availability on our lines. So how much we use? We certainly want to use our balance sheet to the extent possible to pursue these future acquisitions. But again, it’s going to really be dependent on each individual acquisition that we target.', 'Ben Klieve', 'Got it.', 'Matthew Szot', 'Does that answer your question?', 'Ben Klieve', 'Yes, absolutely. I think that does it for me. Thank to you both. I’ll get back in queue.', 'Mark Wong', 'Thank you, Ben.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Roger Miller of Frontier Investments. Please go ahead.', 'Mark Wong', 'Hey, Roger.', 'Roger Miller', 'Good morning. I’m glad to be here. I’m a longtime investor in the company. And obviously, I’ve seen it change quite rapidly. What are the possibilities for hemp? [Multiple Speakers]', 'Mark Wong', 'Yes. Hemp is a very interesting crop. In that, it is legal in – federally legal in the U.S. And so there’s a big push to look at the crop and its possibilities. CBDs, which are the main chemical components that people think are good for pain, for sleep. And so there’s a lot of people putting CBDs into lots of different products. Hemp is also a fairly high yield there in terms of ton – tons of cellulose per acre. And so people think maybe it’s a substitute for the paper industry or for other things can be made out of hemp fiber.', 'We – so right now, the hemp industry is really one that is planting clones, not seed. So you clone little plants and then growers buy those and plant those. And there hasn’t been much work done on the seed part of hemp. So we’ve got one or two small trials going on where our breeders are looking at the possibilities for hemp.', 'One thing that’s very similar is our stevia operations. In stevia, you also plant small plants. You don’t plant from seed. And so we have a lot of experience cloning small plants. And so, the stevia guys are also kind of looking at hemp. But we – but to be fair, Roger, we don’t really have a strategy or we would have said something to the markets to you all, we are interested in hemp.', 'I personally have been involved in hemp with other investments. But I don’t see right now an opportunity that I want to commit S&W, too. It’s an interesting market, lots of people are getting into it. But right now, we have so many opportunities in the more traditional agricultural crops, that – with on paper, very, very interesting returns.', 'Like I said, mid-teens or higher, that we just don’t want to lay on the risk of a new market like hemp, where nobody really knows how big it’s going to get with the acres grow a lot and shrink a lot. If you follow marijuana as sort of a crop that maybe hemp will emulate, when the first one Colorado where first came legalized marijuana, I think, about six years ago.', 'There was a lot of money made early on in the first couple of three years. But it’s really – marijuana has proven to be a crop like any other ag crop. Its price varies with demand and supply. And right now there’s more supply in marijuana, both legal and illegal, then there is demand and prices have fallen over the last three or four years and not many people are making money. It’s difficult to understand that given mostly the Canadian companies that are public and the huge valuations, they get multiples of sales, right, not multiples of earnings, because a lot of them don’t have earnings. But it’s a risky market.', 'We think we’re watching them, for sure. We watch both of those markets. We kind of understand what’s going on in them. And – but we think the opportunities for S&W are really more focused on the four crops that we have: alfalfa, sorghum, wheat and sunflower and then our stevia operations.', 'Roger Miller', 'Okay. Well, I appreciate you answering my question.', 'Mark Wong', 'Yep. You’re welcome.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Wong for any closing remarks.', 'Mark Wong', 'Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call today. I think it’s come across that we’re pretty darn excited about S&W’s prospects, what we’ve achieved in 2019, where the company is going in 2020. We’re calling 2020, the year of integration. I mean, we’ve got to show that we can take market share in our crops. We’ve got to show that the investments we’re making in breeding and in sales and marketing can get us the additional bags of seed to the top line and to the bottom line.', 'So, stay tuned. We’re going to probably do one big acquisition in the year. We’ve got a couple of candidates for that. So it’s busy time. It’s a wonderfully interesting time for S&W and for U.S. agriculture and worldwide agriculture in general. And we’re very, very excited about the opportunities that we have. So thanks, everyone, on the call, and we’ll look forward to talking to you in the quarter again. Thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'The conference has now concluded.

This was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; Buy One Take One, and Never Ending Pasta Bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. While this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long term.', 'Recognizing the strength of Buy One Take One promotion, Olive Garden added $5 take-home entrées to the Everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. It has been met with strong guest demand, and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business.', 'Everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like Chicken Parmigiana and items from the Taste of the Mediterranean menu like Chicken Margarita. This initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference.', \"Finally, the Olive Garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. A key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. During the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales.\", 'Overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. Olive Garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on this strategy and competing effectively.', 'LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth.', 'On a two-year basis, LongHorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. The LongHorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement.', \"During the quarter, the LongHorn team ran two successful menu promotions; Grill Master Favorite and Fire Crafted Flavors, which were supported by their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign. They also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality story through multiple guest touch points.\", 'The team also continued to focus on ensuring the to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. The team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time.', 'During the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. Additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area in more than half of their restaurants. These actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%.', \"Finally, LongHorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. Team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining, and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. We know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences, and the LongHorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance.\", \"Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. The trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter.\", 'In addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. These restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project.', \"While it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the Cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. At the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduce friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress they made last year repairing [ph] fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory.\", \"During the quarter, the Cheddar's team continued to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels.\", \"Overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. Because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the Cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience.\", 'For example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. With these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics.', \"Near the end of the quarter, Cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their Quick Pick Lunch Combos starting at $5.99. These combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year.\", \"I recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the Cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved HR metrics are encouraging. Now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend.\", \"Cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any Darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. They will be leveraging Darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan.\", \"Finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in Texas, and I'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level.\", 'In closing, I’m pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. Our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders.', 'Of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests.', \"Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\", 'Rick Cardenas', 'Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%.', \"First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter.\", \"Before I get into the detailed results from this quarter, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. Consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. However, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release.\", 'This quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. This change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods.', \"Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. I'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants.\", 'Restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. General and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage.', \"Our Q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. We still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong EAT margin of 8.1%.\", 'Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth.', 'Segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants.', 'Sales for our Other Business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter.', 'As you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. Looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things I would like to address before we open up the call for questions. Both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance.', \"First, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. Since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact Darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter.\", 'Second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, Hurricane Dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. We are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter.', \"And with that, we'll take your questions.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', \"Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir.\", 'Matt DiFrisco', \"Thank you. My question is with respect to the Cheddar's, I guess, lagging in difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn. Would you attribute that mostly, it sounds like to the marketing spend? Can you sort of bracket or compare how much pullbacks of marketing spend there was versus last year in either terms of dollars or in terms of weeks of support, so we could get a better understanding of that?\", 'Gene Lee ', \"I'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in Cheddar's. I would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in Cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before.\", \"And one of the big insights is that our frequency in Cheddar's is higher than any other Darden brand. And we married that up with some of the research that we were doing, and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low.\", \"And our primary advertising had been more driven towards a frequency play. And we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity, and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to best increase our awareness in markets.\", \"We also recognize the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint, and I would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business.\", \"And so, it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize, and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter.\", 'Matt DiFrisco', 'Okay. And then, I guess, is there something different to the menu that may be triggered a change in frequency to the heavy, heavy user from the past, or is it the change in ownership that they noticed or something like that?', 'Gene Lee ', \"No, it's just the fact that we actually now have the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. That's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis.\", 'Matt DiFrisco', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Sir, your line is open.', 'David Tarantino', \"Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to talk to about the industry trends that you're seeing. It seems like your analysis in the prepared remarks that this was a little surprising that we've seen such soft trends, especially in the most recent months. So just curious to get your thoughts on why you think that's happening? And secondly, do you think you need to adjust any of your marketing or promotional strategies to the new environment so to speak? Thanks.\", 'Gene Lee', \"Yeah. Good morning, David. As I said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. We have good wage growth. We have strong employment. Historically, that's been really good for us.\", \"As we look at the data and we when look at behaviors, when we look at confidence I have -- I personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer, and it's impacting their confidence.\", \"How long? I’ve got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening, how long does this continue -- this environment continue? So, there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than there appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future.\", \"As far as what do we need to do? We need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. I do think that we have to think about how we're going to market in our smaller brands and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? I think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters.\", \"I think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. We're pleased that we're heading into Never Ending Pasta Bowl in Olive Garden, it’s a great promotion for us. We had a lot of buzz around our Pasta Pass this year. And so, I think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumer’s at.\", 'David Tarantino', \"And maybe just a follow-up Gene, does the current environment, or what you've seen recently make you think differently about the degree of difficulty in hitting your comp guidance for the year? I know you have maybe lesser fiscal [ph] comparisons coming up. And how should we think about the middle of the comp guidance or the upper end of the comp guidance relative to where you were three months ago?\", 'Gene Lee', 'Well, I guess, we reiterated our guidance today. We believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%.', 'David Tarantino', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open.', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Hey, guys. This is actually Neal [ph] on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick one here. Wondering if you can give any insights into commodity costs? You spoke to some elevated beef costs there. Just wondering how you're feeling about this going forward, whether you’ve seen any effects from African swine fever?\", 'Ricardo Cardenas', 'Thanks, Neal. This is Rick. We were about 1.5% inflation in the first quarter, which is around where we expected it to be. We have seen a little bit of elevation in beef, but the boards are coming back down and are a little bit more in our favor. So, we still expect our inflation to be where we thought at the beginning of this fiscal year.', \"As a result, or as an answer to your African Swine Flu question, we still haven't seen a very big impact in African Swine Flu. As we mentioned in the last call, pork is really only about 2% of our sales. So, it's a relatively small impact. And we haven't seen the downstream impacts of pork prices yet.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Perfect. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Next question is from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.', 'Joshua Long', \"Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to the trends you've seen here lately and maybe any sort of regional variations, or any regional variations you've seen across the system? And then, also, in terms of your initiatives and kind of the underlying trends you've seen, any sort of differences in the weekday, weekend trends? You've got some very strong lunch offerings in there, but didn't know if that was may be moving the needle like you expected or may be ahead of expectations?\", 'Gene Lee', \"No. I really don't have a lot to add to your question. We’ve really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. I would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business.\", 'Joshua Long', \"Great. Thanks. And then one follow-up, if I may, in terms of your work on the To Go business, the strength there is still very promising. Any sort of learnings you've had as you stuck with this and worked on the fulfillment internally, versus the thought process of working with external partners? I know, you're always testing and always learning. But curious on what you're seeing there, if there's any update.\", 'Gene Lee', \"I think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they’re taking friction out of the process. And, I think, we're getting -- it’s like anything else, repetition is a great thing. You continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business.\", \"So, I think LongHorn has made tremendous progress. We've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. Olive Garden has really honed in on this process. They continue to find ways. Very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses.\", \"We think that's something to continue to look at. So to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. I think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered.\", 'Joshua Long', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open.', 'Brett Levy', \"Good morning. Thanks for taking the call, gentlemen. If we could just hone in a little bit more, I'm going to ask the consumer question a different way and hopefully get some sentiment of a different answer. When you think about…\", 'Gene Lee', 'We could try.', 'Brett Levy', \"I'll try. When you think about the consumers right now, are you seeing any changes in how they're using you? Obviously, take-home is further building out your off premise, but are you seeing any changes in terms of full price value add-ons, size of parties, something like that? Thank you.\", 'Gene Lee', \"No, Brett. No, we haven't seen any change at all. And -- when I look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. Let's think about what Olive Garden has done in the last two years. Even though the industry has weakened, I'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at Olive Garden with two-year comp that I think is extremely impressive.\", \"And so the industry and a lot of the comments that I made today about the industry decelerating, I look at our two large brands; I think they're competing very effectively. The gaps are very, very strong to the industry.\", \"So, I think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and I'm excited. And yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and I think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter. \", 'Brett Levy', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'John Ivankoe', 'Yes. Hi. Thank you. It’s also just an industry question for you Gene. Obviously, Knapp all-store traffic has actually been negative and what I think you said to a previous question is a relatively strong underlying consumer environment, especially in terms of some of topline trending. Where do you see -- that consumer actually going? I mean where -- if that consumer is working and that consumer has higher income, where is that consumer currently dining -- whether it’s in the house or out of the house is kind of the first question?', 'Secondly, do you see independence -- being great cycle as we are as potentially taking care versus chains? And what would you look out to maybe a shake that some supply growth that’s been added in the space over the last several years?', 'And then the final point, I think, you kind of you mentioned a few times more value at Olive Garden and in Cheddar’s. Is there any thought of bringing back couponing and doing other things that are going to be direct call to action for the consumer for you to maintain traffic and what you described earlier as any industry environment?', 'Gene Lee', 'John, you get the award for most questions inside a one question.', 'John Ivankoe', \"It's all related. I think you can do it in one paragraph. \", 'Gene Lee', 'I got independence, I got discount. What was the first?', 'John Ivankoe', 'The first one was…', 'Gene Lee', \"Where are people are going. John we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. And you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. And I don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. I'm not sure we’ve had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. Again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share.\", \"The data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. Where you see independence and small regional change are in really what I would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and I think performing well.\", 'But I think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents.', \"As far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. When you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. We have to look at our overall advertising program. What is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. We have multiple ways to put incentives out there. And so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. And we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way.\", \"The one thing that, I think that we are proud of, and I'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. And we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. And as Rick talked about, our plus 8% EBIT margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. And so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term.\", 'John Ivankoe', \"That's great, very helpful, excellent answer.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Andrew Strelzik', \"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple of months, we've been hearing a lot more about delivery take rates coming down, being renegotiated lower. Wondering if that changes your perspective on the liability of delivery for Darden at all, especially as you've kind of highlighted some of the changes on the digital side and the willingness given the numbers that you cited for customers to engage with the brands digitally, if your thoughts are evolving at all on delivery?\", 'Gene Lee', \"No. We haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. We will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. But I think -- I have a lot of concerns about that. This is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate towards convenience?\", \"And so it's something to watch. It's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. And we'll watch it, but I want to pivot back to what I said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. That seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that.\", 'Andrew Strelzik', \"If I could just follow-up on the value piece then just quickly. The Olive Garden price was about 2% for the quarter. Was that what the underlying price was? Not that it's a huge deviation from where you've been prior, but should be thinking about a little bit more price broadly at Olive Garden going forward?\", 'Rick Cardenas', \"Andrew, this is Rick. The price was 2.2%, I believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. We still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. So, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter.\", 'Andrew Strelzik', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Anderson from Maxim. Your line is open.', 'Stephen Anderson', \"Yes. Good morning. I would actually want to ask about the test you have underway for your rewards programs to see a multi-concept. As I recall, it’s about 7% of your storage, you're testing that out right now. I wanted to ask about how the test is progressing? And whether you are ready to roll that out to additional locations, or potentially entire system? Thank you.\", 'Rick Cardenas', \"Hey, Stephen, this is Rick again. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. We're still monitoring that test. As we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we’d have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come.\", \"The test is going okay. It's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. We're going nationally. And when we do, I am sure all of you will be to first to know. But, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. The fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what Gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers.\", 'Stephen Anderson', 'Yes. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open.', 'Dennis Geiger', 'Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about mix, and I guess specifically on Olive Garden, is the impact that you saw in the quarter was roughly in line with expectation prior to the quarter? And then, more importantly, just looking out over the next few quarters, anything that would make you think the mix contribution could remain above kind of a long-term steady state? I guess if you could just kind of highlight some of the mix considerations this year, some of the puts and takes, thinking about incentives, trade-up promos, catering delivery or catering off-premise, et cetera. Thanks.', 'Rick Cardenas', \"Yes. Two things, I think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 Take Homes. Those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. The $5 Take Home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term.\", 'Dennis Geiger', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Eric Gonzalez', 'Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I think in the first quarter you benefited from a few extra weeks of the Buy One Take One as you pull that forward. But I think you said in your comment that it was a drag on traffic due to media shift. So I was wondering if you can maybe clarify what you meant there.', 'And I know you had the hurricane impact, but perhaps you can quantify what the impact of not having those extra weeks of the Buy One Take One in the early part of the second quarter? Thanks.', 'Rick Cardenas', \"No. We're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. And we shifted some media; we moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. But I'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. And -- again, I would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn.\", \"And so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. I wouldn't get caught up in that I point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. We made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. Let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts.\", 'Eric Gonzalez', \"If I could maybe sneak in a follow-up there. On the $5 take-home and the Buy One Take One are similar type of -- they are sort of similar programs, are you moving away from Buy One Take One next year or is that something that's on the table?\", 'Gene Lee', \"No, I think they're similar, but different. And so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize Buy One Take One, it's an important part of our value proposition. And if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. It shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. It should -- it really should support it and move it after you run Buy One Take One that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. So, that's how we're thinking about that. So, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all.\", 'Eric Gonzalez', \"That's helpful. Thanks.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'John Glass', \"Thanks. Thanks very much. First just on the other brands and the continued softness there. I think you commented last quarter that there is increased competition. So, maybe what we're seeing here is just more of that. But can you talk about how you think about -- what it's a breakthrough strategy to help market those brands better if you can achieve them national advertising scale of those brands?\", \"And does delivery makes sense in some -- we talk about delivery holistically, do you like delivery or not. But does it make sense in some brands, may be some of these smaller brands, it's worth giving a try given that they don't have that scale and delivery through the aggregator sort of provide scale that they don't otherwise have?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Well, it's an interesting concept John. As you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. They are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. But I think in this environment, I think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them.\", \"I think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. And so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. As far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, I really don't see that as upside. We do have one of our tests in the majority of the Yard House's. We are using a provider.\", \"Just think about where Yard House is located. It's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. So, it's not a big part of the business. So, I don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. I think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. We've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. We've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive.\", \"We also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. And it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. It's going to have a one year impact on the comps. And we have that once in a while. These are great brands.\", \"We're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. I wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. These are strong business models and I'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. We're going to protect the overall business for the long-term.\", 'John Glass', \"Thank you. I'm sorry to belabor the value point on Olive Garden. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. You spent last year reducing some of the couponing or discounting and reserving that value power if you needed in the future.\", \"Are you now suggesting you need that today, or is this still, it's in the reserve, but you are not really changing your view on increased value promotions in 2020 as it stands today?\", 'Gene Lee', 'I mean as it stands today, I think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that Olive Garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry.', \"We'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. I do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. And you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend.\", \"And because we run a TBI or a TBI test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. I think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. It's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. And right now I think, we're looking at the Olive Garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment.\", 'John Glass', 'Great. That’s very helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open.', 'Jake Bartlett', \"Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question was about Cheddar's. And I'm wondering where you think you are now in the integration of the business, the turnaround of operations, the improvements and in the context of your acquisition and strategy going forward? Do you feel like you're in a position now, where you might get more active on acquisitions?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Well, that's a two-part question. I think where are we on Cheddar's? I think today, I'm more optimistic than I've ever been. I think, as I acknowledge in my opening comments there’s still a ton of work to do there.\", \"This is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. Where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses.\", \"We have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right General Manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. So, I think that, I'm very encouraged; the HR metrics are really starting to improve. I'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. I'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. I'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. And I'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. And an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. So I'm encouraged that we can solve that. But we're going to solve these problems for the long-term.\", \"We’re going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right. This represents less than 8% of our overall business and I'm really resolute in the fact that I want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. I think this is still a huge opportunity. And as much urgency as I'm putting behind it, I'm more concerned about doing it right.\", \"As far as M&A activity, I use a standard statement. But the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. And I really have no further comment on that at this point in time.\", 'Jake Bartlett', 'Got it. And I had a follow-up question on your level of incentives and your approach to incentives. And your traffic has been negative the last two quarters at Olive Garden, obviously, outperforming the space significantly.', \"As you look at that, are you focused more on the outperformance or your absolute level? And I'm kind of wondering how long you're going to -- you would kind of tolerate negative traffic versus kind of trying to insert more incentives to try to drive that positive?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Yeah. First of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. I mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. And that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. We're not doing that for multiple reasons. And we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that.\", \"I think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. There are other times when you look at the business, and you say, I'm okay with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model.\", \"And so, I don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. I think it all has to be done in balance. And I think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts.\", 'Jake Bartlett', 'Great. Thanks for taking the question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris O’Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.', 'Chris O’Cull', \"Thanks. Good morning. First just a point of clarification and a question. Is the $5 Take Home entrée promotion considered a new off premise transaction, or is it just an add-on to the dining check? And then, Gene, can you provide some more detail about how Cheddar's plans to broaden reach with its advertising? And when we might start to see that investment?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Yeah. The $5 Take Home is an off premise transaction. And as far as Cheddar's goes, I mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. So we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn.\", 'Chris O’Cull', 'Okay, great. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.', 'Peter Saleh', \"Great. Thanks. Gene, just a couple of questions on Cheddar's, can we just go back and talk about the guest satisfaction scores, may be direction that you're seeing there? Are those improving, or have those kind of started to go backwards?\", \"And then on the turnover at Cheddar's both manager and the crew level, are those -- how far are those off of Darden's average? How much more work is yet to be done there? Thanks.\", 'Gene Lee', \"Good question, Peter. Guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and I would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down.\", \"As far as turnover, the metrics are still outside Darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is I think is a really good trend. And it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to Darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time.\", 'Peter Saleh', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Jeffrey Bernstein', \"Great. Thank you very much. One clarification first. Gene, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the industry comps continued to weaken and then you did mention -- I'm just trying to gauge whether you think it’s older to tough compare because I think that was what you mention initially as a rationale or whether you do see that there is some sort of change in the consumer behavior, because when you look at past couple of quarters, it seems like the two-year trend on comp and traffic seems relatively stable. So, maybe you're looking at broader industry data that we don't get a chance to see more holistically or whether you think it's again more just the two-year comp compare being more difficult or where there's actual change in the consumer?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Well, I think that, I think it's a combination of both. I think that's what I was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but I think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult.\", \"But I think, what I was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. We thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. It may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at GDP growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. So, we were just I think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative.\", 'Jeffrey Bernstein', \"Understood. And then just want to talk about Cheddar's, I'm just wondering things like the under-the-hood metrics are getting better and you seem excited about the opportunity longer term. I was just wondering whether frustration on the sales in the short-term might lead you to delay when you would otherwise ramp-up the new unit growth which seem like that was the big opportunity over time, I'm just wondering whether that timeframe might have changed or have been pushed back at all?\", 'Gene Lee', \"Only the timeframe has changed. I think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and I'm not so sure that I haven't said that we won that battle yet. And so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. And I don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. We're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. And I want -- I really want to see the management depth continue to build.\", \"And then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. But I don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and I'm going to give a timeline today. I'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. And I know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically.\", 'Jeffrey Bernstein', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. No more questions at this time. Let me now hand the call over to Kevin Kalicak.', 'Kevin Kalicak', \"Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Thursday, December 19th before the market opens with conference call to follow.

Thanks so much for joining us on the call today. So, I'm Rose from the Investor Relations team at Salesforce. With me on the call is also my colleague Matt from Investor Relations. Super excited today to host the call alongside Bill Patterson. Bill is our EVP and GM of Service Cloud.

And, thanks again, everybody, for joining us. I guess, Bill, maybe just to kick it off, for those folks that haven't met you before, could you just give us a little bit of a background on yourself? And then, I just wanted doing that. Could you just talk a little bit about what products are sort of within the broader Service Cloud portfolio, just so people can kind of think about that as well?\", 'Bill Patterson', \"Sure, of course. And first off, nice to meet you guys, today. I'm Bill Patterson. I'm the Executive Vice President, General Manager of Service Cloud here at Salesforce. I've been at the Company for the last two years, really focusing on kind of our innovation, our growth and our customer success, as she mentioned. And prior to that, I spent about 14 years at Microsoft, leading strategy for the Microsoft Dynamics division. It’s great to be with you today.\", \"The question you asked about products in my portfolio. Today, I'm responsible for the entire Service Cloud business, which comprises of our core customer service, case management, knowledge management capabilities. Classically speaking, this is called our customer engagement center solutions. So, classically that’s a solution that you’d deploy in your service organization, your contact centers et cetera.\", \"I'm also responsible for the growth of our field service offering, so how we help organizations transform the front line service operations of their workforce. And it’s a great growing business in our portfolio.\", \"And the other products to make up my portfolio are in the areas of digital engagement, so modern ways in which customers use channels like WhatsApp, and WeChat, and Facebook, to engage our customer service teams. Sales-service which is -- are the service experiences that in communities that people use to engage brands. And then, finally, I'm also responsible for the innovation strategy for our Service Cloud Essentials product for small businesses.\", 'So, it’s a big portfolio, lot of innovation, lot of great exciting things going on and just exciting to share with you our strategy and activities today.', 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. And obviously, you’re now roughly a little bit over $4 billion run rate on the business, growing at 20%. So, when you look at the size and scale of this business and the growth with it, what’s sort of driving demand these days? Maybe start at a high level, then, start narrow in from there. But, is it just the broader economic push towards more subscription models and more of a service economy? I guess, when you sit down and talk with big customers of yours, what’s sort of getting them to really invest in this area in particular?', 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes. It’s a great question. And I get it a lot in terms of what drives kind of activity in this area. And I would say that on one regard, everyone talks about the concept of digital transformation and the transformation of retailing an organization in this fourth industrial revolution that we’re in. I’d just probably go just a level below that in terms of strategic conversation, which is, for many organizations, it’s no longer possible to differentiate products and services on the basis of price or features, as more and more of our world becomes commoditized, organizations are looking for that last wave of differentiation to drive their growth. And customer service, often times is what sets those leaders apart in their field. I think, when you think about the brands that have lasting appeal in our lives, often times it is the service moment, the service experiences and the lasting service activities that have us even drive repeat purchases or performance with the products that we do business with.', 'And so, I’d say that at the highest level, it’s often organizations looking to continue to seeing growth or differentiation that service sets us apart. And I’d say, that’s probably classical speaking, on the core kind of service operations, as you mentioned service kind of driven economy inside those companies, but certainly how they’re thinking. And then, lastly, I would say, it’s probably also around this notion of front office, field office operations, creating a better economically viable notion for how organizations go out and serve their customers in field. And a lot of companies today that employ kind of remote workforces or field workforces are looking at that last mile of excellence as ways again to cement that differentiation. And that’s why I think, a lot of organizations are looking to technology like field service, that sets themselves apart.', \"So, for the most part, it’s that. It’s the high level of differentiation, it's the growth potential, a degree of cost savings sprinkled in that causes companies to really reflect on their existing posture. And Salesforce is continuing to lead them into next era, if you will.\", 'Kirk Materne', 'And maybe, just because you brought it up on the field services side, obviously you guys have remarked about just sort of the really strong growth in that area, and it’s just like ClickSoftware.', 'Could you just talk about sort of that opportunity, where we are today and what buying Click does for you all? I believe you were working with them as a partner from technological perspective anyway. So, what was sort of the thought process, maybe doubling down in that area, in particular?', 'Bill Patterson ', 'Yes. I think, our biggest competitor still in the field service domain is the pen and paper. And we get a lot of the front office operations centers as nondigitized. And, I think, we see a large opportunity to bring more modern technology to the front office operations. And ClickSoftware was the technology that we baked our own Field Service Lightning on two and a half, three years ago when we first debuted it to the market. And, we had a great strong partnership with the ClickSoftware team, so much so that we wanted to complete and further cement that relationship with the acquisition that will lead to the next wave of innovation and growth for us, largely speaking.', \"So, the opportunity is kind of large and profound. And I would say, it’s not limited to just, say, the technician marketplace; home health care professionals, financial advisers, organizations actually performing retail operations with this technology. There is a broad need for kind of modernizing the service operations that are out in field. And we see that need in such a way that's driving great opportunity for the platform of field service.\", 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. And I guess, not to get too far ahead of where things are today. But, as you think about 5G rollouts and IoT and more connected devices, I guess that would sort of fuel even more potential demand for field services around these new connected devices that might be out there and just sort of products that have been around.', 'Bill Patterson', \"Absolutely. I mean, I think, as every organization looks to the digital kind of transformation of their business, it’s creating moments of great opportunity for growth or products that are complex. And I think, in servicing those complex products in the world, that's what our Field Service Lightning product does, it helps kind of ensure that that’s done with efficiency and care, and ultimately drives great customer satisfaction. And that's why I think, again further cementing our thoughts and differentiation, the ability to close loop from the service centers, to the field service center, to the service experiences to the communities and then binding that all the way back to the complete view of the customer, that's what’s leading customers -- companies to invest in Salesforce for this part of their transformational strategies.\", 'Kirk Materne', 'And, you mentioned pen and paper being the biggest competitor for you. What is the competitive dynamic, I guess, when you go and have these conversations? Are there other people in there, bidding against you for some of these bigger service opportunities? Is it still a little bit more a white space? To me, it just seems like this is still a very wide open market, even with the size of the business at this point in time. Could you just give us I guess the sense of the topography of the competitive landscape?', 'Bill Patterson', \"Sure. I think, there are most competitors out there today that focus I would say on the transactional affair of field service. And that just means simply scheduling and distributing resources in an efficient manner out into the workforce. We see your traditional Oracles and SAPs that are there connecting kind of more of a focus on just that operational excellence, if you will. And I think where those entities kind of lack or where we differentiate is really focusing on the relationship side, the customer side of that equation. We have a lot of companies that come to us today with entrenched or prior investments in an Oracle and SAP, wanting to go the next mile in terms of customer experience and eliminate the guesswork on the customer side of the equation of going my technician will actually be there. And that's truly where I think our position at Salesforce is unique, our focus on putting the customer at the center of our operational strategy. And more companies are trying to get that way, become more customer-centered in their thinking that our Customer 360 platform really makes that come together in ways that they didn't know were possible, one; and two, unlocks a lot of potential to differentiate in that last mile.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"Makes sense. And that sort of opens up maybe my next set of questions, which is really, the ability for you all to more sort of verticalize within service these days. And obviously, I think, when Keith came on, there was just a very specific focus on being able to speak the language of customers. And I think, that's even more important as you get into a service sort of mode with -- or if you're in a service context. So, could you just talk about sort of how you’re sort of blending? Obviously, you’re in charge of a horizontal platform, but how you're working with the vertical organizations within Salesforce to come together and build out some of these more specific sort of industry-focused service paradigm -- or service offerings?\", 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes. Well, the one thing I love about customer service is not unique to any specific industry. Every company has its. And I think, the way in which organizations in kind of discrete industries focus their service operations really gives us an opportunity to even, one, innovate in that category of the industry itself; and then, two, bring with our leadership position, cross-industry point of views, into helping to make certain industries better, to be candid.', 'We have four products today that are industry oriented. These are products built on our platform of which kind of service contributes innovation. The first one is our Financial Services Cloud, which is focusing on kind of the wealth management and insurance markets, broadly speaking. And this is a great market -- a great example of wealth advisors spend a lot of their time selling than a lot of time servicing their customers. And so, this is just where, again, you see us bring unique and discreet innovation for this audience with the customer at the center. It causes us to really do something special on the platform.', \"The other industry products that we have is for healthcare, and we call that our Health Cloud. And then, we just recently announced in the last weeks here a manufacturing cloud, as well as consumer goods cloud, both of which include the Service Cloud capabilities at the center, if you will. And I just think that's, again, one of the opportunities that we see, by listening to our customers to really work on walking the -- a mile in their shoes and adding that mile in terms of last bit of innovation on their platform. We just continue to find new ways to serve the market at large.\", \"But, I’ll go back to a point I just was mentioning. I do think specifically, the cross-industry perspective in service is where we need to kind of make sure that we don't just kind of solve a one way dimension for a market. And a good example, I spend a lot of time with our airlines and hospitality customers, where they are not looking inside their own industry for better excellence, they are looking into other industries like high-tech and health organizations where data is more abundant, if you will to rethink their service operation. So, while we take an industry focus of some products and other industries we take a cross kind of industry mentality, and I think, ultimately serving our customers with our holistic innovation portfolio is how we continue to delight on that front.\", 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. That’s a really good point. And then, I guess, maybe along those same lines, obviously, over the last few years, you all have added new technologies to the service -- to Salesforce. Your portfolio is something like a MuleSoft where I’d imagine in some of these industry examples, whether it’s healthcare being able to pull data that might not have been in your service cloud into that, to be able to make better decisions, more accurate decisions. So, I guess, the question is, how are you also leveraging other technologies or horizontal technology platforms within Salesforce, whether it’s MuleSoft or AI, and can you just talk about how those technologies might be expressed in a service context?', 'Bill Patterson', 'I’ll give you a best example. I mean, it’s really routine that a customer service professional has to toggle between multiple applications, just simply to do their job. And I often joke with our customers that clearly the inventor of LPAD [ph] never had adopted customer service, because they had to -- the ability to go between multiple applications just simply to handle the routine use cases is quite suppressing. So, imagine in the case of MuleSoft, our ability to interface multiple applications at the moment of interaction that a customer might experience the brand, whether that be on a website or in a product, they experience themselves, or even an agent facing desktop application, the ability to pull multiple data points together to ultimately solve problems, there is beautiful partnership that we have with the MuleSoft innovation portfolio, really is getting to the heart of what service is, which is getting you back to your life. Because, last time, I checked no one really wants to call a customer servicing for a day. It’s really about getting back to continuity of experience in products that customers and companies really want to focus their efforts on. So, that’s the case of MuleSoft.', 'In the case of AI, it’s the same thing. The amount of data and insights and intelligence that come through routine phone calls, it’s fascinating when you actually have -- can watch a customer service interaction, a routine phone call, if you will. A customer might be on a phone call 10, 15 minutes, but only certain data elements come on to that often times in the most systems are captured. And yet, all the conversations, the back and forth, the trial and error, the information that a customer is volunteering, when they’re attempting to solve their own challenges or problems if you will, these are treasure troves of information the companies can get access to, to really make products better, to make experiences better, and ultimately to serve customers better. And so, that’s where something like Einstein being able to really get in to the essence of what is going on in the service operations and how to resolve that issue faster creates incredible innovation potential out of the service discipline, to make company smarter. And that’s what we’re doing with our Service Cloud Einstein product line, which just comes as part of our platform that you can use, to help triage your problems, classify your problems, and resolve your problems even quicker.', 'Ultimately, this is why working at a company like Salesforce is so great is all of the innovation areas from across our portfolio are to serve the customer and to serve the customer in some way that just naturally fits and makes the routine special.', 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. Maybe just on Einstein in particular. When you think about the base of your customers within Service Cloud, are we really just at sort of the tip of the iceberg in terms of customers that are able to take advantage of those features from an AI perspective? I guess, how quickly is that -- is there are a lot of set-up required, do you have to change business processes to take advantage? I guess, where do you think the opportunity is to I guess go deeper with AI within at least the Service Cloud?', 'Bill Patterson', \"I think, there is three areas in AI in the customer service domain that we center our innovation thoughts around and also our customers are responding in time. I think, the first classification of AI that we see in service is really kind of what we would call, deflection technology, which is kind of taking let's say an AI or autonomous bot and putting it as part of your service experience and having a response to commonly asked or routine questions from properties such as your website or media presence et cetera. And in that regard, that's a really easy set up for companies to use with our Service Cloud Einstein Bots technology because that often that information sits as part of your service experience or your online health articles that come from our cloud, et cetera.\", \"The ability to kind of turn on and go, we have some companies recently that get up and running in less than three weeks and handling multiple billings interactions on the platform just because they want to set it quickly and sell it quickly and go. And that's the first area I'd say that's more of this deflection technology.\", 'The second area I would say is more on the routine systems technology. And these are things like recommended answers, recommended articles, recommended people that should be involved to help kind of install or resolve these issues. These solutions just turn on and work immediately as part of the service cloud product. There is no setup -- no additional setup required to make that happen. And ultimately, this is what’s leading companies to drive very meaningful return on the average handle time. The routine metrics that you find in service, this set of AI investments are really focused on to help companies improve their operational performance.', \"And then, the third area I would say that we're focused on is what we call optimization or predictive technologies, which are I’m handling of particular case or handling a particular problem, there might be a product recommendation that comes as a result of that solution. There might be a next logical offer that you might want to make to retire a legacy product in favor of a new product that's come out. So, these solutions take a little bit more involvement such as setting a strategy for your organization. And this is where Salesforce, we partner with our customers to really understand their outcomes or intent they are moving for, and then build to fix more of these solutions in their world.\", \"So, between the deflection, the assistance and more of this optimization or predictive technologies, we have an incredible array of AI that's being used by our customer base. Most of them are very easy to get up and going and get up and running, some of them require a little bit more advanced, strategic thinking behind to make fully fit in the world.\", 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. One of the questions I get a lot about service cloud is kind of how you all interface with some of the communications as a service vendors, whether it’s Five9 or like RingCentral, kind of where is the line of demarcation, I guess in terms of where your functionality kicks in or maybe you take over from them? Can you just explain that a little bit, because I get a lot of questions on that particular topic?', 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes. And, I would say, classically speaking, this world isn’t quite federated, based on like you said, the technologies that might be used for certain channels, if you will; and in the past, I would say that certain vendors focused by channel, whether that be phone or emails or say chat. And I think those worlds are blending, even as we speak.', 'In the case of the phone channel, we have amazing partnerships here. We have partners with the Five9, [indiscernible], the Avayas of the world, as well as some of the upstarts in Twilio, as well as Amazon from an Amazon Connect strategy. And so, I would say that our strategy here is to work with the choices from our customers and to make the experience natural and seamless for those channels to plug into our preferred service desk, which is the Service Cloud Service Console. ', 'And then, I would say, in terms of -- beyond the phone channel, it kind of varies. Today, Service Cloud has solutions for I call this my digital engagement portfolio, Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, SMS as well as web chat solution. We take these solutions and kind of embed it into customer applications, which we call our Snap-in strategy. And so, we have a lot of channels that just become deeply integrated with Service Cloud. But, we also work with people like Vonage and the Nexmo solutions that they might have solutions for local social networks such as Telegram in Israel that they could use to then make part of our portfolio.', \"So, I'd say, just broadly speaking, our strategy is to work with our ecosystem and make our ecosystem just seamlessly part of our tightly bound experience. In some cases, that ecosystem is focused on discrete channels. In other cases, it's focused on kind of discrete markets or technologies. And that's the beautiful thing about our platform is it's very inclusive that all partners can play, become part of our AppExchange and reach a very, very large customer base that we serve.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"That's really helpful. Thanks for diving into that. As you mentioned earlier, customer service isn't necessarily unique to one particular industry, it's also not necessarily unique to any particular geography. So, customer service issue is sort of a global challenge for any company. So, what do you see, I guess, from a Service Cloud perspective, in terms of where the business is, maybe in the U.S. versus the international part of it? And, I guess what's the -- what have the trends been on that front? Obviously, international for Salesforce as a whole has been really strong. I was wondering if you could talk about that maybe qualitatively from a Service Cloud perspective.\", 'Bill Patterson', \"Yes. I think that from a global basis, there are some really interesting trends that emerge. And while we're all united under one kind of altruism, the customer services, important to business, it really is kind of interesting to see in different markets and regions, certain trends arise. And I'll give some examples. In North America, what's really fascinating to me is the requirement of service to really be tightly integrated or connected to a combination of your commerce experiences, as well as your marketing experiences.\", \"And I think, again, at Salesforce, our ability to bring together Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Service Cloud together to serve a set of experiences that maybe are more digitally inclined is one area or one focus kind of trend, if you will. That is one that we're paying attention to and very excited about, given our technologies in those other clouds, if you will. And our ability to kind of how all of these solutions come together and operate around one focus on the customer, I think is giving a lot of organizations permission to look at Salesforce in a more holistic manner.\", 'In Europe, one of the trends that we’re tracking is just a workforce and demographic trends of the workforce itself. And in this case, I’ll give you an example of field service. In the case of field service in North America, we saw a real movement in trend towards outsourcing as intentional strategies for organizations, either size and scale needs for different labor forces. That is both true in the field service side as well as the context for some of these customers. In Europe, we haven’t necessarily seen that. And a lot of that comes due to language and variations of population in different countries. And so, where you might see an outsourced world in North America, in European markets, you see a labor force that are directly employees of that company. And so, the ability to manage and understand the labor force that provides service operation, whether that be field service or contact centers, has a very, very different anatomy than what you might look at in, say, North America entity.', 'And, in Asia Pacific, you really see this explosion of digital taking force. And the digital, what is kind of unique in that market is, in the case of a market like Australia or even say Singapore, the explosion of WeChat as a channel -- a channel that is not owned by a company or a corporate entity where you might be interfacing your brand with your brands, that channel is exploding in terms of what consumer sentiment is gravitating to. So, organizations really are required to even rethink this service experience in a digital first manner that is coming there.', 'So, what’s fun about being in the space is, whether that be highly digital and marketing alignment with sales and e-commerce -- or sorry, marketing commerce in the states or North America, to workforce and labor dynamics and changes that are happening in the European market, to again folks are going digitally inclined service experiences in Asia. It’s fascinating to watch this category and to be a leader in it, because it allows us to have a lot of fun serving those markets with a different technology pursuit that we have.', 'Kirk Materne', \"Yes. Really, your business is growing, so that it may be hard to really get a check on this. But, could Service Cloud turn maybe a little bit countercyclical in places like Europe, meaning, it’s slower economy. What makes you happy invest more on the services side to kind of keep the customers you have. I'm just kind of curious, we obviously get a lot of questions about macro in Europe. And I was kind of curious if you’re having thoughts on that. You might not have insight in that, but I’ll be curious if you did.\", 'Bill Patterson', 'I think, it’s too early for us to kind of signal or tell about the macro impact on just customer service technology at large. I can say that those markets are strong growth markets for me today. Hard to tell whether that be macro driven or just opportunistically growing in those markets as well due to other labor changes. But, I would say that, it is something that we’re monitoring. And in the sense that it is countercyclical -- sorry, you much more eloquently can say that faster than I can. But in the case of that scenario, this has always been the case of customer service technology. And down market organizations tend to become really focused on retaining their revenue streams. And that is an area where, we do see a lot of focus on service spend. It’s really kind of that matches down to be focused on retaining as much of the customer relationship as possible.', \"And I think, I wouldn't say that that is something that we get excited about that kind of macro trend for the growth of service, because it just as much in growing times, we also see the differentiation potential to really set organizations apart as another reason to invest in this category. So, I don't think it's unique to downward trend. I do think that organizations today and where they are just in terms of modernizing their experiences are investing in service. And based on kind of what your situation of your company is, whether you are on differentiation mode, you are spending on service; and whether you are on retention mode, you are spending on service.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"Bill, I have some clients with us in the room, and I know a couple of them might want to ask you questions. I'll hand it over them.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Yes. Hi, Bill. This is Harry. I had a question on your Customer 360 initiative. I was just wondering if you could help us to understand, what are the key pieces of that initiative, and how does that help you in the digital transformation projects where you seem to be gaining share?', 'Bill Patterson', \"Yes. Great question, and thank you for it. Number one, the area of focus on the first set of Customer 360 is bringing together all of the view of the customer and all of the positions that a customer might hold in terms of data and allowing you to have a more complete view of that in the service moment, if you will. We announced at our Connections conference just recently the service for commerce and service for marketing initiatives where depending on where you are in your life cycle, you’ll get view of say where someone is on your website in the shopping mode, showing up in your service console. So, if you’re abandoning a shopping cart during a checkout activity, that's sort of technique will see that and then make kind of attempt to reach out and bring you back into that buying cycle in that moment. So, that's probably number one is this notion of kind of full view of all the different positions or journey that you might be in as a customer to make sure your service team has this clarity about what's happening when that relationship is that area.\", \"And I think another area that's really driving us -- or probably two other areas, the second one is on communications. Today, a common scenario for marketing is to use a channel like SMS to broadcast promotions to a customer. And for a lot of kind of bespoke or discrete marketing functions, one simple action kind of breaks that journey very quickly, which is simply fine, the SMS message. What we're doing at Salesforce is building our technology, so that you can send a marketing promotional SMS, reply to that and then that actually makes this hand into a service team or service technician to be able to engage you and serve you better. That's in more of a collective outreach.\", \"And then, the third area of our Customer 360 I would say that we’re really excited about is, using our AI functions to reach into a service moment and make intelligent recommendations or predictions about products that you should be using, if you are calling about a legacy product. We call that our Next Best offer in Next Best Action technologies. These are all part of our Customer 360 platform that are helping us bring together the worlds of service in commerce, service in marketing and service in sales together in ways that classically maybe competitors just in the service domain don't really have access to.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"Bill, obviously, there's always a lot of discussion about Salesforce’s landing big customers, but seems to me like the Essentials offering with Service Cloud is something that's pretty interesting. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us a few details on the offering and kind of your thoughts about the opportunity.\", 'Bill Patterson', \"Yes. I'm -- in my portfolio, this is the area I'm most excited about, to be very honest. I think, this is where organizations today in the small business are able to retry and reshape or rethink service for the future, because that entire company depends on it, thrives on it, if you will. And I think there are a lot of organizations today that need a partner like Salesforce to come together, not just with a small business customer service offering, but really a small business offering that helps you run sales and customer relationships and service all together that kind of helps you just grow your organization. And that growth comes from both acquiring and retaining your customers.\", \"The thing that our Essentials product does is, it's a fully functional capability for small business teams; it combines Salesforce automation and customer support together. And it starts at $25 per user per month. So, it’s a heck of a deal for small business teams wanting to grow their business. And we're very, very excited about it because it gives us chance to experiment and try and bring new innovation out quicker because our small business teams are deeply connected to us, to give us feedback directly about what's working, what's not working for them. And because of the size of those organizations around the offerings, they can experiment and see the yields faster than maybe a big or global company can because sometimes in big and global companies, it needs more time to measure response of their efforts.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"That's interesting. How long I guess the Essentials product been out there, as it is today?\", 'Bill Patterson', \"Yes, platform has been a little bit over a year that it’s been out in the marketplace. And it's a great solution, a lot of customers that use every day, very, very exciting part of our portfolio.\", \"Of course, I guess also to build kind of solutions that are simple and easy, and that doesn't mean kind of strip down in terms of the functionality, but it's really focusing on user experience with the offerings that we're creating here.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"Just a couple more for you and we'll let you run. But, one of the thoughts that I had about Service Cloud when I talk to investors about it is, it seems to me that that Service Cloud opens up a lot of opportunities in maybe verticals where Salesforce hasn't been as broad as people might think. The government, to me, it always seems like most obvious example where the government doesn't necessarily need a Sales Cloud because they're hopefully not trying to sell -- maybe they are trying to sell something. But, they're meant to be servicing their constituents. And I was just kind of curious, when you think about the opportunities in some of these markets where frankly as a percentage of revenue, Salesforce probably has a lower percentage of total revenues from something like the federal government or even, local governments. Can you just talk about maybe some of the vertical markets you see that are really right for this product to kind of take off over the next three to five years?\", 'Bill Patterson', \"Yes. Great question. I think, you rightfully pointed out public sector as an area of growth and an area of opportunity for us to be thinking about. And I would say that any industry that is really focusing on the service-driven mindset, and it's so funny, because in the past, even areas like high tech where really a lot of spend has gone into innovation, we're now starting to see a lot more focus on the service ability of that innovation as driving another kind of wave of focus in terms of what company’s priorities are.\", 'So, I would say that any industry that has this service mindset, which is really about taking a moment of interaction and creating the value add on top of that moment of interaction is really an opportunity or candidate for Salesforce and specifically Service Cloud. And we start to see a lot of non-standard, and maybe classically going beyond just customer service, so now really focused on also opportunities like employee service operations. Southwest Airlines is a company we just talked about in our last quarter that has decided to use the excellence that they’ve had in customer service really to turn that into a great internal operational excellence center for employees, so that if there are HR cases that needs to be processed or questions about benefits or pay or a situation that might happen on board with a passenger. They’re using our platform; they’re using our Service Cloud technologies to turn that same kind of rigor around documentation and problem identification and revolution or repeated patterns to create another set of opportunities here.', 'So, I just think that service or a mindset in those organizations that have service at the epicenter of their operations is where we see that kind of the next wave of growth potential here.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Bill, you obviously have delivered very respectable growth over the past few quarters, probably one of the strongest ones in the Company. I was wondering, do you see any catalyst on the horizon that can accelerate the growth from current levels?', 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes, I do. I think, there’s a lot of opportunities there -- I was just mentioning around thinking of not just the customer service team as the only place to be focusing our directive kind of innovation add but really thinking about service as a holistic function and enterprise, would be horizon of opportunity that is something that’s on our minds.', \"And I also think, looking at the labor dynamics and labor shift that’s happening and service at large, there’s a great confluence of factors occurring where a lot of people have kind of looked at the role of AI. And well, AI come in and completely disrupts service teams, what I'm actually seeing is quite the converse that AI enters into a workforce and creates higher value service engagement opportunities because AI can actually take maybe some of the lower labor work off of the plate of humans.\", 'So, if you think about the horizon of automation or a horizon of kind of customer success management, I mean, these are all things that I think are -- maybe somewhat in the adjacencies of the classic customer service operations, but are just quite [candidly] focused on value creation for clients and client operations. And really making it sort of human labor is at a premium that could be served with great technology like minds.', 'Kirk Materne', 'Thank you. And last one for me, then, I’ll let you go. But, really, it’s very early days. But, just the opportunity that maybe we have with Tableau technology and use its Service Cloud offering and/or our customers that you see using Tableau, maybe do visualization around the service organization, or I guess, how do you see that acquisition maybe helping your business grow as you look out?', 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes. Just due to where we are in the Tableau acquisition, it’s early days for me to comment specifically Tableau’s innovation or Tableau’s technology. But, I’ll kind of connect it to a more broad theme around data and data visualization and the service function, because I think that’s where customers certainly are thinking in those same lines.', \"As it relates to supply and demand or interconnectivity of that supply and demand in the labor force and service, organizations today really struggle with being able to kind of make all the pieces come together. And imagine, for a lot of companies, their service labor force is pretty fixed, and it has capacity that is pretty set, if you will. And let’s say that the marketing team may not always be aware of how much capacity is in that labor force. And so, our ability to kind of help organizations connect with supply and demand of how much labor needs to be invoked as a result of marketing activities or sales initiatives or new product launches, combined with kind of the actual capacity and utilization of that labor force in the service centers, that's just one great visualization that companies today struggle with in this being able to see the big picture and see how it all kind of come together.\", \"And what happens oftentimes is, without that insight, who suffers most is the customer. They just whole time get elongated, and customer service team often gets blamed that they're keeping company [customers] on hold. In the reality, that simple exercise is of showing others what the capacity and demand of the service center might mean, means that product teams need to build better products or experiences, or marketing teams need to be more thoughtful for when they run those ads or when sales teams needed to really push -- make those sales pushes because the labor force may not be available to just be there with an elastic supply.\", \"So, I think, that's the kind of example that we are excited to introduce with new visualizations and technologies such as that -- such as Tableau. And I think, that's the kind of thing you can be sure that is on our mind for our customers moving forward.\", 'Kirk Materne', \"That's great. Well, Bill, thanks very much for dialing in. My quick editorial is that the Service Cloud obviously makes sure it’s still a huge part of the growth opportunity for Salesforce. So, if you haven't got a hold of our deeper dive on the Service Cloud, let us know, happy to send that along. But, everybody thanks for dialing in. Bill, again, thanks for taking some time out of your schedule. We’ll look forward to hearing your keynote at Dreamforce in seven or eight weeks, and seeing how you integrate some of the campfire mascots into your presentation will also be interesting.\", 'Bill Patterson', 'Yes, great. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the time and the great dialogue. And yes, look forward to seeing at Dreamforce soon.', 'Kirk Materne', 'Thanks a lot. Take care.', 'Bill Patterson', 'Bye.'], ['CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) Goldman Sachs 28th Annual Communacopia Conference September 18, 2019  2:55 PM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Jeff Storey - CEO', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'All right. Welcome back. And we are happy to start here with our next session, which is Jeff Storey, the CEO of CenturyLink. Jeff welcome back to Communacopia.', 'Jeff Storey', \"Thank you very much. I'm happy to be here. May not be as interesting as creative arts in the previous session, but I think it's pretty interesting.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"So [indiscernible] Level 3 closed almost two years ago and you have completed all the major integration activities by this point in time. So this effort largely behind you, what are CenturyLink's key strategic and operating priorities?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"It's kind of the same stuffs we just talked about during the integration. We're focused on driving a great customer experience. We think that's the key to our business. We're focused on being operationally very efficient and have operational excellence. So that we give that great product and we give that great customer experience.\", \"We're also focused on growth and investing in growth. We've talked about our Edge computing strategy. We've talked about our fiber overbuild. We've talked about our building ads. So we're investing and making sure that we're expanding what we already believe to be the world's greatest network. We're focused on delivering and making sure that we are getting into the range of 2.75 to 3.25 that we've talked about for the next three years and really focusing on that.\", \"And then we're also, while we're doing that, still looking at ensuring that we're managing our free cash flow. And so if you look a couple of weeks ago, we raised $1 billion, at 4.625% and the idea behind that is managing free cash with managing interest expense, taking advantage of the opportunity that we saw in the market to do that and changed our delivering plan, we'll continue to do that over the course of the next three years, and then just running the company well.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"The key reason you were enthusiastic about the merger was the ability to optimize your product offerings around each of the company's strengths and ultimately to compete for more business. Can you give us some examples of key ways you've improved your go-to-market execution, maybe for example the way you've integrated and realigned the sales force?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Sure. We have fully integrated our sales force and alignment. We're managing them within a common approach across the various channels. We look at revenue but we also look at sales. We make sure that we're managing them for a combination of those things. Revenue is important to make sure we manage to churn. Sales are important to make we manage our growth. And so we'll continue to do those types of things. We've aligned our product set.\", \"One other comment on the sales team. If you look at our small and medium business customer sales team, we've been working really hard to simplify what we're asking of them. At one point, they had like putting products or services that they needed to sell. We want them to sell four or five. So we're streamlining the product, simplifying our go-to-market offering and making sure that our sales team is in a position to be successful with those things.\", \"We also are looking at our product sets and trying to do a better job. If you look at SD-WAN, we took the best of both SD-WAN capabilities and are trying to make sure that we integrate that in such a way in go-to-market in such a way that it's really effective for our sales team to grow.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Have you indeed been winning more opportunities and where do you see potentially gain share where you are the most under penetrated?', 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, we've been winning opportunities. I think that there is several areas where we can continue to gain share, and it's everything from the federal government where I think we've got a great reputation and great traceability. But I think we can continue to grow share. We recently won the U.S. Census Bureau and talked about that on our last earnings call, and so I think there's opportunities there. I think there's opportunities in our international IGAM business. We've got very good relationships with our largest customers, and we'll continue to focus on those customers. But we think that they're growing and we can help them grow.\", \"If you look at our Enterprise business, we are continuing to grow and expand our capabilities. We got to get better about making sure that we're delivering up with those customers. But I think we have great opportunities with them and are doing a good job today. Small and medium business, our best opportunity is outside the legacy CenturyLink footprint. If you think back to Level 3, Level 3 never sold to small and medium business customers. We have a lot of business buildings on that, which have small business customers in it, but we never sold to them. We were not -- that was not part of our market focus.\", \"It is a part of the CenturyLink business plan. And so, I think there's great opportunity for us to take the capabilities that we've historically used in region and sell those products and services and capabilities outside of region in the 150,000 plus buildings that we have on that.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"So that was more of enterprise, and actually in the second quarter, you saw improved sequential revenue trends in your Enterprise segment, as well as your IGAM segment, which is your international segment. And combined that's a 43% of the business. So these are really the two most significant fixed segments you have. And you said that you expect higher revenues from these businesses in the second half versus the first half. So I guess the question is, what's driving this improve trends? I think early in the year, you've given us some insight into the strength of sales, into strength of the funnel. Can you give us any more updates on that?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes. So the first thing is, the decisions that we've made about unprofitable revenue streams that created headwinds for us as we move up and profitable contracts to stop selling unprofitable services, things like customer premises equipment that type of thing. And so we've had those type of wins, those are behind us by enlarge. The second is that we've seen good sales. So as we talked about this on the second quarter call, sales improved from the first quarter to the second quarter and that gave us confidence that we were making progress in the market with our customers.\", \"We've seen good performance in our service delivery capabilities. A lot of times after an integration, we worry about your ability to continue to deliver services for customers, and sometimes you'll have a dip in that capability. We haven't had dip in that capability. In fact in some ways, we've enhanced our performance, and so that gave us confidence. And then we look at the funnel. And we have good funnel activity and have good close ratios out of that funnel. And this is just the fundamental basics that go into looking at our business gave us confidence to get that out.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"I think we're almost halfway through the second half. I mean do you feel like the second half is unfolding the way you'd anticipated?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"So we don't get guidance mid-quarter, but I feel confident in the analysis that we did into the second quarter that led us to making those statements.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Okay. Another common question we get is, okay, there's a lot of things that seem to be clicking right now to help the business turn. What's your view on the durability of all those factors you just laid out? In other words, if we do in fact see enterprise and IGAM trend higher in the second half versus the first half. Do you feel that that's evidence that you have hit an inflection point to some extent in the way you're getting financial performance out of the business?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"So if we look at what I think drives our business long-term, it's the market and our ability to meet the market demand. So if you look at the market, the need for more capacity and more locations with greater flexibility, with higher security, with management of the cloud applications as opposed to the network infrastructure itself, all of those trends are moving in our direction. And so I look at the market and say, yes, we have challenges with declining revenues from legacy services that the products and services that we're selling our customers need and they're going to need for the coming time.\", \"So then the second question is do we have the ability to meet that market demand? And I believe and I'll get instead of here with any of the other companies and argue that CenturyLink has the world's best fiber network. And certainly in the years, we can combine that with our subsea connectivity, our EMEA connectivity, LATAM, I think it's the world's best. But certainly in the U.S., I believe that we have the world's best fiber infrastructure. And the ability to scale it and grow it at a pace that other people can't match, in a timeframe that they can't match, at a cost point that they can't match, we have conduit infrastructure.\", \"And if you look at virtually every next gen carrier since the late 90s, they're combined in the CenturyLink business whether it's WilTel, Broadwing, or Global Crossing, or Level 3, or Qwest or Genuity. I mean we've combined all of those together. A lot of them have different philosophies on how to build, but we --most of them have multi-conduit strategies. WilTel had three conduits. Broadwing had 2 point something as an average Level 3 that we built 12 conduits. And as we look at our network, we have the ability to pick the fastest route between any two markets, which improves our latency.\", \"We have the ability to pull new cables. And I don't know the exact penetration, but maybe have two or three of those conduits still. We don't have half of them still. We have two or three of them out of the 12 that Level 3 had. And so we have the ability to pull capacity and faster and new capacity. So we announced a few months ago that we were building an overlay ultra-low loss network, that's really important for our Dark Fiber customers. It's really important for our Hyperscale customers. It is important for our own ability to scale capacity. But we actually announced that after most of the North American network was already done. So we have the ability to do it very, very quickly and rapidly.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"I want to go back to something you alluded to, you talked about getting away from unprofitable revenues, right. So, you've been resetting some of your large customer contracts and pulling back from either low or no margin equipment sales on the efforts to drive improved profitability kind of regardless of where there's revenues, because your point is these were low calorie revs, right? To what extent are those efforts already reflected in the revenue run rates that we see in the business that we kind of saw in the second quarter. Meaning do you feel like a lot of its reflected there, or was there anything else we have to be accounting for as we think through the next couple quarters, including things like FX?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Well, FX I'll take separately. I think it's reflected generally in the second quarter. Year-over-year, comparisons might still be hard, because they've been in the third quarter or fourth quarter of last year. But I think it's largely reflected in the second quarter. With respect to FX, I personally don't manage my team around FX like building constant currency. I don't want to give a windfall for FX and I don't want to give the penalty for FX, they can't control that.\", \"We do look at FX as a percentage of the overall revenue. I think 95% of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. If you look at IGAM, it's certainly a higher percentage, but it's still less than 30% of our revenues in some other currency. Of those other currencies, there is only a couple that are more than two or three, that are more than 1% of our overall revenue. And the largest is the U.S. talent, excuse me the UK talent. And so largely hedge begins that, because our North America -- our EMEA headquarter is located in the UK. So I don't spend a lot of time worrying about the effects of FX. Although, it certainly can affect IGAM revenue a little bit.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"In the past you've talked about how you're seeing more and more enterprises looking at updating their network architecture, for example by taking advantage of software defined networking. So this isn't just looking to re-price existing MPLS contracts, you're trying to do something broader based. To what extent has this created an opportunity for CenturyLink to win share? So for example, are you actually getting invited into more RFPs where there's a legitimate chance that they may switch vendors and select you?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"I think so. But it's the whole breadth of services, it's not just SD-WAN. It's the fact that we have a gradient MPLS solution coupled with our SD-WAN. Just the fact that we have great security solutions and managed services solution. So I think it's the overall package not any single individual product. It's the portfolio of products that really allows us to win.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I guess the question is, are there actually more jump balls right now in terms of what you think you can compete for?', 'Jeff Storey', 'I think so.', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"All right -- I'll leave it there.\", 'A - Unidentified Company Representative', \"So it'd be hard for me to prove mathematically, but I believe that's true.\", 'Q - Brett Feldman', \"Okay. It is a broader question. But if we just think about your businesses, you’ve significant exposure to a wide spot of small and large businesses and you also have exposure to the consumer economy. And a common question we're getting is, are the companies that we're talking to getting any insight as to let's say the economy is typically, do you think there is anything shifting or slowing down out there?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes. So I'll talk about the Enterprise business, mostly in this comment. I don't see any major shifts. So I see what drives customers to us is what I said earlier, their market need and our ability to meet that market need. So I look at our execution. If you've listened anything I said over the last 10 years, I've never said the economy is helping us or the economy hurting us. It's our execution. If we execute well, we win. If we don't execute well, we lose.\", \"And so I don't see any major things. Can the economy choose timing slightly? Yes. But I also see opportunity in economic challenging times, and we've seen this historically. If a customer -- if everything if going right, the business is booming, they don't want to mess with anything. They just want to leave everything running, let's not change anything.\", \"If they run into challenges, either in the way they're delivering services or their customer relationships, they may look at how do we evolve and make this better. And so I think that creates opportunities for us, not just negative headwinds as a result of maybe slower timing but I think it creates opportunities for changing the way our customers do business.\", 'Q - Brett Feldman', \"Cost transformation has been a big initiative for you. You're currently targeting $800 million to $1 billion of runway OpEx savings within three years. Are you making good progress, because as of the second quarter, I think you've already achieved $290 million. And you've talked a lot about seeking transactions out of the businesses, one of the tactics here such as customer service calls and maintenance requests. Can you frame your success year-to-date or really just to-date and executing against that opportunity, it's not just the dollar amount which we just talked about, but the actual tactical execution against taking those transactions out?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, I think we're making great progress. And the example I've given in the past is our consumer business customer calls; and our customers call us, in 2017, something like 15 million times; in 2018, something like 30 million times, but it wasn't a random event that they stopped calling us. We said how do we solve the issues that they're calling us about before they call us. We can look and we can see that our costs are very too high in our call centers to take all these calls. What can we be -- we can move to handle the call more efficiently that's fine.\", \"But what can we do to stop the reason they're calling us, because they're genuinely aren't calling us to say thank you. They're calling us because there's a problem, and they're not happy about it when they're calling us. They're thinking, I mean, I have to sit on hold for 45 minutes it is not a good experience. And so our team said, why are they calling us and how can we stop that? And so things like Price for Life.\", \"We went in and said, we're making our billing too complicated. And we had too many promotions that as the promotions rolls off, the customer calls us and says, all you've done is raising my bill. They forget this six months earlier, they signed up for a promotion that rolled off. But it actually improved our ARPU, improved our churn, improved our costs to deliver the service and improved the customer experience, because customer now has reliable, predictable, costs associated with their service.\", 'And so, we looked at that not as a cost exercise, even though it had great cost benefit. We looked at it as how do we improve our customer experience, and believe that that drives in. And I can give you example on the same things in our enterprise business.', \"If you think about our dynamic connections, our customers call us today for installment capacity, they've got a data center, they want to go to AWS, or they want to go to Microsoft Azure, or they want to go to Google, they want to go to some cloud provider and it could be Salesforce.com, it doesn't have to be one of the others, it can be an application provider. And they want to get to those locations, they have to call us, they have to wait, they have to install a circuit, we have to have people design it, we have to have people go out and build the capability.\", \"Today, what we're doing is giving them dynamic connections so they can type in keystrokes and say, I want the capacity goes this destination, this day. I want to increase the capacity tomorrow. I want to redirect the capacity the day after. We looked at our cost to provide the service and said, how can we provide a better experience at those places that cost us a lot and so dynamic connection is the outcome of that. It gives customer much greater capabilities. Today they have to type in command. I think that very shortly, it will be their AI system talking to our AI system to implement the network in the way that they need kind of on the fly.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"So if we're looking at cost buckets and look at things other than the ones that you just talked about, I believe last year your cash operating expenses were something like $15 billion, and about a third of that, so about $5 billion, was on third-party network costs. That's obviously a significant area where you could target to bring down your overall expenses and to drive your margins higher. Can you give us some sense as to what the opportunity is there? I mean, just even within the $800 million to $1 billion that you're targeting, what portion of that do you anticipate is going to come from bringing down off-net expense?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Sure. And if you look at the network access expense, that includes more than just third-party off-net circuits. It include some people and other things that we follow the guidelines of how to report. But it does include the third-party off-net expense. And there's no better dollar for me to take out than a third-party off-net expense. I get multiple benefits from it.\", \"Number one, when we have a customer on net, I can provide better service to that customer, guaranteed. I don't have a third-party involved. It's better for me to provide that customer on net. So we were very diligently focused. Secondly, we make more money, because we're no longer paying off-net to somebody else. And third, I don't fund anybody else's network build fund our competitors. And so, I like all three those benefits. Better customer experience. Better profitability for us. And that's the -- those are the main things.\", 'And so how much of it? If you look at our build of 4,500 to 5,000 buildings, a quarter we did 4,500 buildings in the first quarter, 5,000 buildings in the second quarter. A significant portion of that is to make it possible for us to move off-net to on-net. If any customer we have in one of those buildings today is by definition off-net and we want to build that infrastructure in and bring them on-net. It drives revenue because we have capabilities, but it also drives EBITDA improvement and free cash flow improvement.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Can you sustain that piece of off-net to on-net within your current CapEx budget, or should you increase the CapEx to accelerate that?', 'Jeff Storey', \"So the limit is not CapEx. If the limiting factors were CapEx then we would increase to do that. I don't feel that we don't have enough money or access to enough money to do the things we need. The limiting factors are working with customers and getting them the groom the traffic, because we got to make sure that we're coordinating with all of their vendors and coordinating with their schedules and their busy periods and that sort of thing. And so the bigger issue is, how do we coordinate effectively with customers to groom them that's the one limiting factor.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"You look at the pace of which you are taking these transactions out of the business, you look at how large the off-net cost saving opportunity can be, and we look at how far you are into achieving a three years cost savings program already, feels like that's a reasonably conservative target. I mean, do you think there's opportunity to outperform there?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"I think there's opportunity for us to continue to transform CenturyLink. And then over the very long period that has tremendous cost benefits to it. I wouldn't look at the position that we're at versus the $800 million to $1 billion that we've targeted and say, there's more upside to that, that's lumpy. It's going to occur and one quarter will be faster and next quarter will be slower. But in general -- generally, you think that is linear. But I wouldn't say that you should think about, well, that's going to accelerate other things, other opportunities.\", \"We have line of sight to the $800 million to $1 billion. I mean, we know what we're looking for we identified various things. I do think that it doesn't stop there. I think that the way we're transforming the business fundamentally changes our cost structure, going forward, and we'll continue to do that. And then as we reach these -- these transformation targets that we've talked about, if we think it's appropriate, we'll give guidance for more. But I do think that there's opportunity for us to continue to transform.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And the key reason we asked about is that you have said that CenturyLink is an EBITDA growth company, and this is something you seem to be on page to achieve at least in the near-term through cost transformation. The question would be. How do you need to be positioned, as you complete this cost transformation initiative in front of you, which obviously you might be able to extent, in order to drive growth in EBITDA over the long-term, and do you see a path to consolidated revenue growth or at least revenue to be a much more important part of how you drive EBITDA?', 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, I do think revenue is an important part of how we drive EBITDA and making sure that we do a good job managing our churn and the legacy products that are rolling off, and then managing our sales and the new products that are taking the place. It's not a new phenomenon though. If you look in telecommunications over the last 15 or 20 years, we regularly have products and services that are rolling off and regularly have products and services that are becoming available. 15 years ago, you never would have heard of a wave of service, you never would have heard of MPLS, and yet that -- those are large components of our business today. And so, it's a part of our natural evolutions, it's part of our natural business cycle.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'So earlier this year, you decided to low your dividend in order reallocate cash towards debt repayment. And as you noted, you said a target of de-levering the balance sheet from about 3.8 times net debt of EBITDA as of most recent quarters to 2.75 to 3.25 times within three years. How did the Board, or how did you and the Board, determine that this was an appropriate level of leverage for CenturyLink? And in what way do you think it provides you with more flexibility when you get there?', 'Jeff Storey', \"Well, we gave a range because I don't have a specific number is the right, so we gave the 2.75 to 3.25. So I don't have a specific number. But I know it's less than 3.8, right? We know that we wanted to reduce our leverage and that in that three range, just to pick the midpoint of that in that three range it was a whole lot better for us to give us flexibility, going forward. As we get to that number then we'll continue to evaluate, and we'll continue to look at what is the appropriate leverage.\", \"It doesn't feel me today that it needs to be much lower than that, but I may change my mind three years from now as we get to. Then we will look and say, okay, how can we best use the free cash flow that we have then, and we'll have a couple of billion dollars extra free cash flow if we stop de-levering at that point. And we'll look at the same things we look at today, what's the best way to drive growth and then how do you best return that to shareholders or acquire companies or do various things with it. But we'll reevaluate that as we get closer. Right now, we're very determined to de-lever and we are very determined to drive growth where we can.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"And [indiscernible] bring up this, because in addition, thinking about this is an EBITDA growth company, you've also made a point that really the long-term objective is growing free cash flow per share. And that's really get to the heart of flexibility, which is when you have your leverage in a place where you feel like you have more flexibility. Do you have any preliminary views on how you can augment that? For example, do you think it would be natural that CenturyLink wouldn't want to return more capital for the buyback of stock, or we'd asked you as a Level 3 CEO for years about M&A? When you look at the portfolio, you have a terrific North American fiber asset, a pretty global asset. But obviously, it could be a bigger or deeper asset. If we're thinking about this constructively, how would you like to try to augment that free cash flow per share?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Well, okay, you've alluded to this but there're two sides of that. I can argument the free cash flow and I can improve the per share. And so those are things that we constantly think about. We want to invest in growth. And that doesn't necessarily meaning revenue growth. It doesn't necessarily mean acquire companies. It means investing in EBITDA growth that drives free cash flow. So investing our dollars and taking out costs is very important to us, the off-net discussion we just had, building into the building.\", \"So I think that drives revenue, because I've got a better customer experience, I've got more to footprint that I can go sell the customers in but we also invest in that to drive out costs. And so, we'll continue to invest in those types of things. As we get closer, one of the answers I used to give, at Level 3 people would say, you're going to generate a billion dollars for cash for next year.\", \"What are you going to do with it? And my answer was, well, we're going to earn it before we spend it. And that's true here too. We're going to continue on the path of building the appropriate balance sheet and then we'll figure out exactly what we're going to do with that. But we're not afraid of being an acquiring company. And we're not afraid to invest in our growth. And think both of those things are appropriate.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"I want to talk about your consumer business a little bit. So if we look at the most recent quarter, I mean just sort of like a one-time charge. It looks like the consumer revenues declined about 0.6% versus the prior quarter, which is pretty stable with the trend line that we saw in the first quarter of the year as well. And in general, that's more stable than you've seen in a lot of the other residential telcos. But you are still using broadband you lost about 56,000 subs in the quarter, mainly because your lower speed, customers are churning out a little bit faster than you can add the high speed ones. And so I guess I just want to start off by getting your view on the competitive backdrop in the consumer segment. And do you think that this fairly moderate pace of top line decline is something that you can manage around? Or is there something that's going to shift the market more significantly?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"I don't think there is anything that's going to fundamentally shift the market. The trends we see there are the trends we see. Voice is declining. Broadband is becoming more and more important. I don't think that the triple play is that important to consumers anymore. I don't think linear video is important to broadband subscribers, and I know other CEOs have talked about some breakage between those linkages. And I agree with that. I know that in CenturyLink's experience, we did a great job of growing broadband customers and didn't do such a good job of growing video customers.\", \"And so there is clearly not the linkage that we help for in that. So I do think that the market will continue the way that it's been. And I see opportunity for us and investing in fiber solutions. And we're being very smart and targeted about where we're investing in fiber, and where we're investing in copper solutions. We have been spending a lot of money on bonding and vectoring, which are technologies to extend the life of copper plant. We're not doing that as much. We still do some but we're not doing that as much. But we're looking at where can we economically invest in fiber and then when we do, how do we drive penetration in those homes significantly.\", \"And so I think that that's the upside. And we've actually --- we still lost 56,000 broadband subs. Our ARPU is improving. And our high speed sales is accelerating. And so we just got to get more footprint out there. And then as we get more footprint of fiber, make sure that we're selling it very effectively.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Although, it does seems like you're willing to choosing not to invest in some of the copper enhancement, which I think a lot of people might agree with. It doesn't mean that inevitably you're going to start seeing greater losses of those customers. The offset being you probably generated substantially more cash out of those relationships for as long as you have them. So are you increasingly thinking about the consumer business as more of a cash flow story than a top line story?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes. We think of it more -- we think of all our businesses cash flow stories, I mean, that's what we're really trying to match. And if there is a home whether it's a broadband sub or not and it does not make sense for us to build fiber to them, because of economics, we won't do it. We won't do it, we will focus our fiber, because we think there's plenty of opportunity where fiber does make sense. And so we'll invest and focus our investments on building fiber in places that you do, are profitable. And then we work really hard with those really speed broadband customers, and really speed can be 20 megabits. It's not just a 1 megabit customer or something like that it can be a 20 megabit customer.\", \"We work very hard make sure that we're giving them the capabilities and Wi-Fi, we're giving them the capabilities of privacy and security in their product to make our product competitive in those locations. And then there's a large percentage of the country where 20 megabits is one of the premier products. And so we don't want to forget that as well, that it's not just 20 megabits or gigabits, there's a lot of places that 20 is good.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Earlier his year, you've commenced the strategic review of the consumer business, which you have acknowledged could be a lengthy process. I mean, do you have any update on this process at all at this point in time? And has anything about it maybe evolved? I think you've been asked in the past whether you're really looking at your consumer business, or whether maybe you're trying to think more holistically about the high length business?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, so no. I don't have much of an update. I'll give you our thinking. But it is a long process. We have hired advisers. We have been looking at the business with a very open mind to where it can be -- our consumer business. First of all, the first option is, can we continue to run it better and better? And what does it look like inside of CenturyLink? Does it create value for us? As we build out 5G for fiber, does that create opportunities for us? Because fiber penetration is denser in the consumer business. Where do we think the free cash flow looks like from the consumer business and operating it for investment, but smart investment, strategic investment?\", \"So that's the first option. Could we spin the consumer business? Could we sell to consumer business? Could we sell this state or that state, or this market or that market? Is in combined with like and non-like asset to it? Is it consumer and small business? I mean, we're open-minded to all of those various things. When you're open minded to all that naturally it becomes pretty complicated. I will tell you that I think the consumer business can generate a significant amount of free cash flow for CenturyLink. And as long as it's doing that, it's something that deserves us paying attention to.\", \"Now I also think that even if -- that we ought to do a better job of how we communicate about the consumer business. And where we'll look in the fourth quarter as we think every year where we rethink how we do disclosures and things. We have to do a better job at how we communicate about the consumer business regardless of what we do with it.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"You mentioned cash flow. I mean, is that ultimately the objective here? In other words, when you're looking at these alternatives, are you going to be comparing it to the cash flow you're generating now and trying to figure out are we going to be doing more? Or is there another way you're think about this?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"No, it's free cash flow per share. I mean it's…\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Okay. You've currently generated about $500,000 of annual revenue from the federal CAF-II subsidies for supporting rural brand band, but that program is set to expire in 2021. The government is planning successor programs, which is the Rural Digital Opportunities Fund. So the first question is. Other than just the $500 million that you're getting, what impact has CAF-II had on your business? Can you give us any update on the degree to which you've been able to achieve penetration in the areas where you've been able to upgrade the network with the funding?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, I don't have any specifics on penetration. I'll point out that the $500 million in revenue cost comes with hundreds of millions of dollars of capital….\", \"So the majority of that revenue that we take in, we spend out in capital. So it's a much smaller impact on free cash flow. But it builds out to the networks that we can continue to sell to our customers, and those solutions for those customers going forward. So we think the program has been good for us. Don't worry about what's the impact to revenue when you lose it. Is that $500 million of revenue going to be $500 million free cash flow? The answer's no. It's not the relationship between that.\", \"If you look at the Rural Opportunities Fund and what that's going to look like. There is a proposed rulemaking early September. We've provided comments I think that we're expecting a response to the final rules by the end of the year. We'll see. We'll see if it makes sense for us to do anything where we've been pleased with the CAF-II and maybe that this is a good opportunity for us. If it is, we will seize on it. If it's not then we won't. But we'll see what the rules are when they come out.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Actually a 5G question. We've got a big merger potentially happened in the sector with T-Mobile and Sprint, it's all about positioning for 5G. I suspect both of them are large customers of yours. And so one question we've been getting is. Is there a part of their synergy that have something to do with reducing their exposure to CenturyLink? But then more holistic question might be, 5G requires a lot of fiber. So I guess as you think about the merger, as you think about what the large carriers are doing with fiber on your network, on-net what does this mean for CenturyLink?\", 'Jeff Storey', \"Yes, so both of those are good customers of ours. And I hate to speculate about what a customer is going to do in a public forum, going forward. But I hope that what we do is provide great solutions for them. If we provide great solutions for 5G for their on network -- on-net services, for voice termination, for all of the types of things that we do for them today, I hope it will grow that relationship with them. I look at 5G and say if you're unaffiliated with a network then CenturyLink is a really good solution for you. If you're unaffiliated in any particular market, CenturyLink is a really good solution for you.\", \"And that applies to the other big carriers too, they don't have networks everywhere. And I want to make sure that we're partnering in whatever network they don't have footprint, we're partnering with them to help build out their infrastructure in 5G. I think it's good for us. I think it pushes our fiber closer and closer to enterprise customers. I think we've a unique position and ability to meet those needs versus other competitors. And so I look forward to it, whether it's T-Mobile and Sprint, or any of the other carriers as well to make sure that we're positioning our products and services in a way that makes them successful.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'All right, Jeff. We are out of time. Thanks for being here.', 'Jeff Storey', 'Thank you. Thank you all very much.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'End of Q&A'], ['ERYTECH Pharma S.A.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\", 'I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Gil Beyen, Chief Executive Officer. Please go-ahead sir.', 'Gil Beyen', 'Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and good afternoon to all. Thanks for joining our second quarter first half 2019 earnings call. We announced our Q2 financial results and business update yesterday evening. You have seen the press release most likely. If not, you can access it on our website. Also, this presentation is on our website on the investor section. Here with me in Lyon are Dr. Iman El-Hariry, our Chief Medical Officer; and Eric Soyer, our Chief Financial and our Chief Operating Officer.', 'So, let’s get started. I draw your attention to the disclaimer on Slide 2 and then switch to the agenda on Page 3. So, following our quarterly routine, I will start with providing the business update and focus on the key highlights for the second quarter and the year-to-date. Eric will then take over to present the financial highlights for the first half of the year and he will also summarize the major expected milestones for the remaining 12 months, of the coming 12 months. We will, all three, then be available to respond to your questions.', 'So, and before starting the update I think it is always a good practice to remind to the essentials of our company, they are summarized on Slide 4. You can see and not surprisingly the same profile as at our last update call, we are still the red cells company focused on cancer metabolism with [indiscernible] and that’s the core, late-stage trials in pancreatic cancer Phase 3, triple negative breast cancer Phase 2, and an IST in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Phase 2.', 'We have industrialized and scalable production with now two owned manufacturing sites, one in Europe that we already had, but have now extended and then one in Princeton for the supply in U.S. that came on stream recently. And next to all the late stage and manufacturing work, we have – we continue to work on leveraging our platform with different preclinical programs that we will briefly touch upon.', 'Going to the next slide. Slide 5, you see the pipeline summarized the overview both clinical and preclinical. Half of it is taken by our lead program eryaspase, which is the asparaginase in red cells and you see at the end of the year. The Phase 3 in pancreatic, the pancreatic ductal adrenal carcinoma PDAC in second line, the study is called TRYbeCA1, and you’ll hear that throughout the call also, I think. Then the Phase 2 in triple-negative breast cancer in first-line, TRYbeCA2.', 'The second-line ALL study Phase 2 is the NOPHO study. It’s an IST and the NOPHO stands for the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, so its them who are – it’s an investigator sponsored trial and the NOPHO is the sponsor. And in the pre-clinical program, you’ll see our next product candidate Methionine lyase. You’ll see ERYMMUNE now, and that’s a new SQZ label, and so, we have partnered our immune-oncology and immune modulation activities with SQZ Biotech in Boston, and then we are continuing to do work on – pre-clinical work on metabolic diseases with – mainly on, most of them on the arginase-1 deficiency.', 'Moving to the highlights. Slide 6, you’ll see here the summary. I will not go in full detail because I have a page for each of them assuming on these key highlights for the quarter and the year-to-date.', 'Let’s go to the first one. It’s on Slide 7. It’s obviously our top priority, the Phase 3 in pancreatic cancer. So, we launched this study in September 2018, which is the pivotal Phase 3 study in Europe and U.S., about 500 patients to enroll, comparing standard of care chemotherapy to standard of care chemotherapy with eryaspase added, our product, overall survival end point.', 'So, we – already at the last call I think we had all 11 countries accepting our clinical trial. So, giving our clinical trial authorizations and now we are in these, and many countries are now enrolling really well. So, the enrollment is on track or even slightly ahead of track in Europe. And the news of the quarter is indeed that we now also have the IND accepted by the FDA, so that gives the authorization to proceed in the United States. We expect that the enrollment in United States will happen soon, most likely Q4, but beginning of Q4.', 'Next to second-line metastatic pancreatic cancer, we are also preparing a smaller still a Phase 1 study in IST, it’s not preparing, but the site is preparing to get started on an IST in first-line pancreatic cancer. It’s a Phase 1 in combination with FOLFIRINOX because FOLFIRINOX is gaining a lot of ground in front-line pancreatic cancer. So, as soon as we can start producing in Princeton, we will – also the IND will be filed for this Phase 1 study. So, that’s pancreatic cancer.', 'The next indication for us in solid tumors is triple-negative breast cancer. You remember chosen also because of the unmet medical need, but mainly also for this – in fact it is our metabolically very active tumor types and we expect them also to [vary ] [ph] dependent on asparagine. It’s a proof-of-concept study here. It’s a Phase 2 proof-of-concept that only in Europe, about 65 patients to be treated.', 'Similar design, standard chemotherapy with or without the eryaspase product with an objective response rate primary endpoint. So, we have clinical trial authorizations in – currently the four countries in Europe in which the study runs and we have something missing in the slide, we have close to 20 sites initiated, not close to two, and patient enrollment started, so first patients have been treated.', 'So, it makes now the two TRYbeCA1 and TRYbeCA2 late-stage programs enrolling. This requires obviously additional manufacturing capacity that growing demand in the EU and we don’t occupy that entire building there. We have two floors, part of two floors of the building where we have our – the one manufacturing facility that we already had before, but we have now doubled it, that’s sort of the second and first floor with the second floor depending from where you are. This has been added. So, we doubled the number of cleanrooms and this extended capacity started producing for the clinical trial in July as planned.', \"In Princeton, things are also ready. We have the construction completed. We have four cleanrooms fully equipped, validation completed and we expect that site will be able to start for the clinical trial in Q4 2019 so imminently. And this is the main update on the – let's say on the GRASPA product and its related manufacturing.\", \"Shifting to the platform; I'm going to Slide 10 and indeed we announced, I think it was in June, a collaboration – strategic collaboration with SQZ Biotechnologies. SQZ Biotechnologies is a cell therapy company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It's a spinoff off of MIT. They have a technology – SQZ technology to load different types of cells with molecules by squeezing the cells through very fine tubes.\", \"And what we have done here is we have granted SQZ an exclusive worldwide license on our IP – on parts of our IP related to immune modulation, mainly through tolerance induction and therapeutic vaccination with peptides. And so SQZ will take this on and so we'll use their technology, their loading technology with our IP and [indiscernible] part of our know-how to develop these products, mainly focused on immune tolerance and vaccination.\", 'In this deal, ERYTECH is eligible to receive an upfront and potential milestones up to $58 million for the first product and then royalties, sales and potential commercial – royalties on sales, sorry, and potential commercial milestones up to $50 million for each additional approved product or approved indication.', \"So, this deal fits nicely in our strategy that we really are increasingly focusing on cancer metabolism, on late-stage programs, but still not forgetting our platform, leveraging our platform to different applications, different indications. That's mainly done through partnering, which we believe SQZ to be an ideal partner to take our immune modulation IP to the next steps.\", \"So, one more slide for the update and [comment a bit] quickly, but it's a – but we also have announced changes to our Board of Directors. This is on Slide 11. Already in – at last call, we announced that we were going to propose Jean-Paul Kress, as the new Director to the annual meeting, to the shareholders and the shareholders has approved his appointment obviously at June 21 just now, so in 2019, and he was then, by the Board of Directors, elected to be the Chairman of the Company – of the Company's Board of Directors.\", 'So, really pleased to have Jean-Paul on board. He brings us 25 years of real experience in pharma, but also in biotech and a good mix of pharma-biotech. So, he started his career in companies like Biogen, Sanofi, Abbvie, Gilead, became CEO of Syntimmune, which was then acquired by Alexion and you may have seen he was recently now appointed CEO of Morphosys.', \"He brings also a good mix, Europe-US; French national, been in U.S. for many years. So, the profile we were looking for. So, we're pleased to have Jean-Paul on board. We're set, on the other hand, to see Allene leaving our Board. She notified at the last recent, couple days ago, I think in the Board meeting that she intends to resign at the end of this month. It's really for personal reasons, in fact, for work reasons.\", \"You may know TESARO was acquired by GSK. Allene's role has been strongly – she has a very important role within there. And so, the combination with us going – was becoming too difficult. But we thank her for sitting on the Board for three years and been a real good support to the company. And I think with this, I have covered the business update.\", 'I leave now to Eric to take you to the financials for the second quarter and the first half.', 'Eric Soyer', \"Thank you, Gil. Good morning, you all in the U.S. So, this is – I'm now on Slide number 12. This is a snapshot of our P&L information for the first half of this year. As you can see, the highlight here is a net loss of EUR29.3 million for the first half of this year. This is an increase of EUR10.3 million as compared to the previous period, the six months of 2018.\", \"This is coming from an EUR8.4 million increase in operating loss, and that was attributable, mainly to the EUR6 million increase in research and development activities expenses, mostly related to expenses that we had with the company's Phase 3 clinical trial in pancreatic cancer. In the same time, we had a EUR3.1 million increase in G&A expenses, of which more than half EUR1.8 million was related to the launch readiness of the company's additional manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and in France.\", \"And finally, we had EUR0.7 million increase in operating income, of which EUR0.9 million, $1 million was related to the milestone payment upon the signature of the license agreement with SQZ Biotechnologies. In the same time, we had EUR1.9 million decrease in financial income, which was mostly related to the translation into euro of our company's cash position held in the U.S. dollars. So, that was the highlights of the P&L figures for the six months – first six months of this year.\", \"I'm now shifting to the next slide. Slide number 13 for a snapshot of our cash utilization and cash position. As you can see, the cash position at the end of the first half of this year, June 30 was EUR94.5 million, which is approximately $107 million. That is coming from a cash valuation – cash utilization in the first half of this year of EUR39.9 million. And that cash utilization was the result of a EUR40.5 million net cash utilization in operating, investing and financing activities, EUR23.8 million in operating activities, EUR17.6 million in investing activities, and EUR0.8 million in financing activities.\", \"And in the same time, with the appreciation of the U.S. dollar in the period against the euro, we had EUR0.6 million favorable currency exchange impact on the cash position. With that, that's enabled us to confirm the earlier guidance we've given on the cash runway, which is getting us until the end of 2020, possibly into 2021. That's the highlight for the cash position and cash utilization.\", \"And before we finish this presentation and open the Q&A session, just reminding the key milestones for the next 12-month period. Of course, Gil mentioned it earlier, the start of our GMP production facility in Princeton expected in Q4 this year very imminently that will enable the start of the U.S. patient enrolment in the Phase III clinical trial for the second line pancreatic cancer trial that's the TRYbeCA1 study, which is also expected in Q4 to start.\", \"And we also mentioned, well that's for the 2020 periods the initiation of the Phase 1 investigator sponsored study with eryaspase in pancreatic cancer for the first line treatments and later in 2020, we expect the results of the Phase II second-line trial in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the NOPHO study, also an IST study. And finally, towards the mid-year period of next year, we would expect the interim analysis into TRYbeCA1 study, again the Phase III in pancreatic cancer that interim analysis is for superiority.\", 'With that, I will turn over the call to Shannon, our operator to open the Q&A session. Thank you.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Boris Peaker with Cowen. Your line is open.', 'Boris Peaker', \"Good morning. My first question is on TRYbeCA1. I'm just curious for the interim analysis, because what would you need to show for the study to stop for efficacy? And also, is there a futility look there that if you don't have enough separation that potentially the study could be stopped?\", 'Gil Beyen', 'This is a question for Iman.', 'Iman El-Hariry', \"Hi. The study – that interim analysis does not have a futility component. So, it's binary – it's basically if the agency will look at the data if there is an enough evidence of advantage in terms of the hazard ratio, then the study will be stopped for efficacy. Otherwise, the agency would recommend to continue the trial until completion. Now, to show an efficacy, we are looking at approximately same hazard ratio, similar hazard ratio to the final analysis.\", 'Boris Peaker', 'Yes, so what would that hazard ratio have to be for it to stop for efficacy?', 'Iman El-Hariry', \"It is what we have provided before, it's around 0.72.\", 'Boris Peaker', \"Okay, great. And my second question is on TRYbeCA2 study in triple-negative breast cancer. Just curious, what's the timeline for the data? And also, if successful, can this be a pivotal study or have you discussed that with the FDA to potentially be a pivotal study?\", 'Iman El-Hariry', \"I'll start with the last point. No, we have not discussed this yet with the FDA. As you know, this indication is a new indication for us, so the current goal is to generate a signal of activity that can enable us to move into a Phase III pivotal study. And at that point in time, yes, we'll seek the scientific advice from the FDA and CHMP.\", 'Boris Peaker', 'Got you. Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.', 'Gil Beyen', 'Thank you, Boris.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Lucy Codrington with Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Lucy Codrington', \"Hi there. Just a couple of questions for me. It seems like Princeton timelines have slipped again. Is there any particular reason why we're now not expecting it to come online until 4Q? And then just regarding the TRYbeCA1 interim, do we need to have a certain proportion of U.S. patients included in that interim, given that the recruitment has yet to start in the U.S.? Could that be an issue? Thank you.\", 'Gil Beyen', \"Hi, Lucy, Gil here, I'll start with the – with your question and hand over to Iman. So, yes, we will now see in Q4, we hope it's early Q4. But indeed, it's two things. We got the IND approval, which was great because that opens the path, that immediately also allowed us to start the discussions with the sites on contract negotiations and site initiation. So, that's one track. But the other track is indeed that we still need to get sort of the approval as we have, it was based on the ARC facility.\", \"Now that everything has been a bit later, we have decided that we will concentrate all the supply for the U.S. parts of the trial from Princeton. And in order to do so, Princeton is now up and running, but we still need an IND amendment to get the Princeton site also part of the trial. And so that's ongoing and that's why. So, these two tracks will coincide. We hope, we expect so that we can start imminently at the beginning of next quarter. And so, I hope that answers your question and then maybe Iman for the second part.\", 'Iman El-Hariry', \"Sure. Hello, Lucy. So, for the second part around the interim analysis and the number are expected or projected patients from the U.S. Technically or strictly speaking, actually from a regulatory perspective you don't need U.S. patients in the trial. However, we need to have U.S. patients clearly from an exposure for market access on all other benefits. So, for the interim analysis, the trial will enroll U.S. patients in this quarter.\", \"And so, we will have – our current projection is to have around 20% or north of 20% projected number of patients if the study continues to completion. So, by the interim analysis, it may not be the 20%. But again, from a regulatory perspective, strictly speaking, you actually don't need a predefined number of patients from a specific [location] [ph].\", 'Lucy Codrington', \"Great, that's very helpful. Just – and Gil, thanks for your answers. [I was actually] [ph] asking about the Princeton facility seems to have been delayed, I believe in the last quarter we talked about it coming online in 3Q rather than necessarily the U.S. trial. So, I was just wondering what the delay was to the Princeton facility?\", 'Gil Beyen', \"The Princeton facility came online in Q2 even, so, it will start GMP batches for validation and everything so that we even – we inaugurated the site on the 20th of June, I think. But indeed, now it is these two parallel tracks one the one hand, the site initiations or at least the contract negotiations and then the IND amendment to also fully have the site part of the trial. That is what's ongoing.\", 'Lucy Codrington', 'Okay, I see. Thank you very much.', 'Gil Beyen', 'Thank you, Lucy.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Reni Benjamin with JMP Securities. Your line is open.', 'Reni Benjamin', \"Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. Gil, if you don't mind, can you just remind me how many sites are open in the TRYbeCA1 study right now? Do you still anticipate a 40/60 split between the U.S. and EU? And you mentioned on the call that enrolment is ahead of expectations. Can you just remind us what your original planned enrolment completion expectations were?\", 'Gil Beyen', \"I'll start, but also hand over – for the number of sites to Iman to answer in a bit detail. So, we started enrolling in September 2018 with an estimate of 18 to 22 months of – to get to full enrollment. So, we have close to 500 patients to enroll. We expect that that will be around mid-2020. So that I think the first part and Iman gives me [indiscernible] we probably have around 70 sites now in Europe and we are targeting about 30, 40 sites in the U.S.\", 'Reni Benjamin', 'Right. And then, in regards to the manufacturing facilities, can you just give us an idea on what the current capacity is? What they could potentially be expanded to? And are these the facilities that would support commercialization, and what would be sort of the max production?', 'Gil Beyen', \"So, I'll leave this to Eric.\", 'Eric Soyer', \"Hi Reni, for the Lyon facility first. Initially, it was six cleanrooms with one encapsulation machines in each cleanroom. We've expanded that to 12 cleanrooms now working in two shifts. So, actually, we have quadrupled our capacity in Lyon and each machine on one shift is able to – on two shifts is able to make approximately 500 GRASPA batches per year.\", 'And in the U.S., the size of the Princeton facility is approximately of the same scale, a bit bigger than the Lyon facility. And it is operated in one shift now, but could be operated in many shifts as well. So, the size of those facilities, both in Europe and in the U.S. have been designed to cover, of course, the need for clinical trials right now, but they are – they will cover initial commercial needs both in Europe and in the U.S.', \"And then when we have to expand, as you know, not – it's not only a matter of expanding facility, but also expanding our supply capabilities both in U.S. and in Europe, also in terms of the gross sales. So, that's why we believe that both in Europe and in the U.S. that we want to expand that would be also possibly in other countries also to have a better coverage of the [entered] [ph] territory.\", 'So, as soon as we have bigger commercial volumes, we are considering, we are actually working on plans to expand to another facility in Europe and possibly another facility in the U.S. once the Princeton facility is fully loaded. And in the U.S., given that we now have a facility on the East Coast, that would make sense to also consider a facility on the West Coast to have a full coverage of the territory.', 'Reni Benjamin', 'Got it. Sorry, just I forgot a question on TRYbeCA1. Has the – how often does the IDMC meet? And have they kind of met recently with? And what is their – outside of the interim analysis, I think they consistently are evaluating safety on a blinded basis. Is that correct?', 'Iman El-Hariry', \"Yes, and so I'll take this question. The IDMC has planned to meet regularly until the completion of the trial or the first – at least the first superiority analysis. And yes, the goal of these regular meetings are basically safety review for the patients coming into the trial, and is also that we had our first IDMC a few months ago that was basically to assess the safety and the tolerability of the combination of GRASPA with Onivyde or resume abraxane. So, it's almost like the size of a small or smallish Phase I – the analogy of a small Phase I trial.\", 'So, that was good. I did see and looked at the data bluntly and had no issues. And now we are expecting our subsequent safety review again during this quarter, so that would be in a sizable number of patients.', 'Reni Benjamin', 'Got it. And...', 'Iman El-Hariry', \"Next quarter, I'm sorry Yes, I...\", 'Reni Benjamin', 'Sorry, which quarter?', 'Iman El-Hariry', \"Q4, I meant to say it's the Q4.\", 'Gil Beyen', \"You're ahead of time.\", 'Iman El-Hariry', 'I am ahead of time.', 'Reni Benjamin', \"No problem. And just one final question for me, regarding the SQZ collaboration, just correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like it's more an IP based collaboration and SQZ is really running the program. Am I thinking about that correctly? And when you talk about focused on immune tolerance, can you give us any sort of color in terms of, are they – are they putting proteins into these red blood cells? Are they more DNA based therapeutics into these red blood cells? How should we be valuing the advancement of this program?\", 'Gil Beyen', \"I'll take this one, Reni. Yes, you're right. It's really an IP. So, it's a freedom to operate type of collaboration, but with a bit more than that. So, they were recently here. So, we're really collaborating on advancing it. But the basis is freedom to operate on our IP so that they can, with their technology, take this forward in this immune tolerance and vaccination type of work.\", \"Immune tolerance; we have done some work early days on immune tolerance. It's by loading the red cells with, it can be proteins, typically there is – even we had some work with myosin, we've had some work with Factor VIII even, so – because we know that a big part of the red cells and their life in the liver as the Kupffer cells, if you give boosts of red cells with these molecules inside.\", 'We had some nice preclinical results on tolerance induction. For reasons of focus and priority, we already – we have not continued to work there since quite a while, but it still was there. And we were sort of really pleased when SQZ knocked on the doors saying, well, it would be interesting to work on that.', \"I'm not sure which molecules they are working on right now, but it's probably similar to what we've done, so probably proteins and/or enzymes, and they're also – by looking at the technology, we also have done work and published on it, on using the red cell to deliver like peptides to different [indiscernible] to the spleen. And in all the discussions, we also found that we were really focusing all our energy to the cancer metabolism. So, also, they're – have given this freedom to operate so that they can take this forward with their technology, but with our sort of support and collaboration.\", 'Reni Benjamin', 'Terrific. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the progress.', 'Gil Beyen', 'Thank you, Reni.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Cogut with Kempen. Your line is open.', 'Alex Cogut', 'Hi. Thank you. Just have a question on competitive landscape. Do you see any programs out there in developments in pancreatic cancer that could change the competitive positioning for you or hamper U.S. recruitment for TRYbeCA1? Thanks.', 'Gil Beyen', 'Pancreatic cancer is really a field where we see very little happening, and this was really also the reason of – one of the reasons for us to go there, there is high unmet need and very little change over time. Surely not any of the cancer metabolism agents like asparaginase, absolutely not. But also, immunotherapy seem to have a – hard to get a foot into pancreatic cancer. So, especially and one of the reasons we think why the enrollment in the trial is so good is, indeed we see no competing or very little competing activity in – especially in second line pancreatic cancer.', 'Alex Cogut', \"And nothing else that you see that could come forward before you actually finish with the readout, assuming, let's say the interim is not successful.\", 'Gil Beyen', 'Not on our horizon, no.

The first quarter of fiscal year 2020 marked the beginning of a transition period for us. With an uncertain regulatory environment hanging over the P2P industry, the market has remained challenging. We took advantage of this period to begin strategically repositioning our business by developing a loan assistance business to drive future growth, while at the same time, maintaining our P2P business.', 'With market demand growing from institutions, we saw an opportunity to expand our relationships with them to grow our loan assistance business, leveraging our extensive experience in borrower acquisition and strong risk management, and operational capabilities. This loan assistance business will operate alongside our P2P and is expected to drive future growth across our business going forward.', 'Our partner institutions have shown strong interest in investing in the underlying assets that are short-term and in small amounts, which closely matches the profile of the high-quality microfinancing loans we facilitate. Our microfinancing loan product typically mature over 2 to 12 months in amounts that range from RMB1,000 to RMB20,000.', 'To grow our loan assistance business and diversify our funding sources, we are working with financial institutions and trust partners such as Bohai International Trust, Kunming Aotou and Phoenix Intelligent Credit Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix Financial Group to provide them with access to our high-quality underlying assets and borrow base.', 'Our partnership with each of them has already yielded solid results. Bohai International Trust has already extended around RMB40 million and Kunming Aotou RMB30 million to borrowers assessed and referred by us as of June 30, 2019.', 'Our partnership with Phoenix Finance has also progressed well, following our strategic investment at the beginning of this year. We expect total loan volumes for borrowers referred by us over the three-year partnership with Phoenix Finance to be about RMB10 billion.', 'We will continue to develop partnerships with other financial institutions, which will greatly expand and diversify our funding sources. We are very pleased so far with the initial results from this new business. Loan volumes funded by institutional partners during the quarter accounted for approximately 20% of total loans facilitated. We expect approximately 80% of loans facilitated by us to be funded by institutions in the calendar year 2020.', 'We have spent several months doing analytical work to carefully customize and fine-tune our risk management system and algorithm based on big data generated by our legacy P2P products to ensure they will continue to be highly effective when assessing borrowers for our micro-lending loans.', 'While this has strengthened the confidence with our partners, the ramp up period was not quick enough to offset the decline of our P2P business, which has been gradually recovering but continues to be negatively impacted by a challenging industry environment. There were some bright spots, however, with revenue increasing slightly by 18.6% on a sequential basis.', 'Nevertheless, we are very confident about the future of our loan assistance business. We will continue to expand our institutional funding sources including licensed financial institutions that operate in a highly regulated and clear framework. They also have strict processes put in place to prevent default.', \"Any default under our loan assistance business will be reflected on the personal credit report of the borrower. What's more? Demand from our partner institutions is continuing to grow, which we believe reflects their trust in the high quality of the underlying assets and the strength of our risk management system.\", \"In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter while we make the transition of our business and I am fully confident that this will allow us to create value for our users and shareholders, and position us to generate long-term sustainable growth.\", 'Given our extensive experience in operating a P2P platform over the past few years, we already have the key capabilities needed to efficiently run and generate steady revenue from the loan assistance business. Our diverse revenue streams and new business lines will ensure growth of our overall business going forward, regardless of what regulatory environment finally emerges for the P2P industry.', 'With our strategy gradually building up to scale, we look forward to leveraging our strong financial and operational resources to grow this diverse business for the long-term.', 'With that, I will now turn the call over to Ms. Kerrie Zhang, who will review the financials.

Further details can be found in the earnings release and accompanied presentation. As Mr. An mentioned, this was a quarter of transition for us, as we repositioned our business by developing more efficient business to drive future growth. This has strengthened confidence in our partners -- among our partners, but the ramp up period was not quick enough to offset decline of our peer-to-peer business.', 'During the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020, net revenue was $4.9 million, a decrease of 90.5% from same period last fiscal year. Volume of credit loans facilitated through our peer-to-peer marketplace was $28.2 million or RMB0.2 billion, a decrease from $0.5 billion or RMB2.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year.', 'On a sequential basis, however, our performance is steadily improving, as the market recovers and our loan assistance businesses grew up, with net revenue increasing by 8.6%. Operating costs and expenses were $12.6 million, a decrease of 18.9% from same period last fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in sales and marketing expenses.', 'Sales and marketing expenses were $7.5 million, a decrease of 35.5% from same period last year, due primarily to a decrease in advertising expenses, as we continue to carefully capture costs during this year. As our business progress this year, we expect to gain operating leverage going forward. Service and development expenses were $1.9 million, an increase of 42.3% from the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in employee expenses.', 'General and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $2.3 million, stable when compared to the same period of last fiscal year. Finance costs during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 were $0.6 million, compared to nil during the same period of last fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to the interest expense for senior notes.', 'Share-based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $0.2 million, stable when compared to the same period of last year. Net loss was $7.2 million, compared to net income of $29.7 million during same period last year.', \"Net loss attributable to the Company's shareholders was $7.2 million, compared to net income attributable to the Company's shareholders of $29.7 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019. Accordingly, basic loss per common shares was $0.15 compared to basic earnings per share of $0.62 in the same period of fiscal year 2019.

Please ask your questions.', 'Josh Vogel', 'I have four questions, please. The first one is, can you please talk about the percentage of borrowers that were acquired from online channels in the first quarter and how that compared to a year ago? And if there was any change, why so? Thank you.', 'Kerrie Zhang', 'Thank you for your questions. In terms of loan volume facilitated, we acquired 42% of our borrowers online and 58% of borrowers off-line in this quarter. During the past two quarters, we began strategically repositioning our business by developing a loan assistance business to drive future growth.', 'Our partner institutions have shown strong interest in investing in underlying assets that are short-term and in small amounts, which closely matches the profile of the high-quality microfinancing loans we facilitate. Borrowers for our microfinancing loans with us are acquired purely online. Microfinance loan products accounted for approximately 22% of total loan volume during the first quarter fiscal year 2020 and significantly contributed to the overall percentage of borrowers acquired online during this period.', '[We had several months doing analytical] work to carefully customize and fine-tune our risk management system and algorithm, based on big data generated by our legacy peer-to-peer products to ensure our system continues to be highly effective, by assessing borrowers for our microfinancing loan products. As we continue to put more effort and resources into developing our loan assistance business, the proportion of borrowers acquired online will continue increasing.', 'Josh Vogel', \"It's nice to see you diversify into the loan assistance business. Can you please discuss some advantages that you see in loan assistance compared to the P2P business?\", 'Kerrie Zhang', 'Thanks, this is good question. With uncertainty in regulatory environment and over the peer-to-peer industry, the market has remained challenging and short of funding from the individual investors. We took advantage of this period of uncertainty to begin strategically repositioning our business by developing our loan assistance business, regardless of what regulatory environment finally emerge for the peer-to-peer industry. This loan assistance business will operate alongside our peer-to-peer business and that is expected to drive growth across our business going forward.', 'Loan assistance business has several advantages when compared to peer-to-peer business. Firstly, demand for good investment opportunities is still strong. There is a massive amount of funding available for investments in the market, but investment options are very limited. Institutional funds have shown great interest in investing in loans facilitated by customer financed companies.', 'Second, we will continue to develop partnerships with other funding partners that are licensed financial institutions that operate in a highly regulated and a clear framework, given the regulations governing investment licensed financial institutions are very clear. This will allow us to operate loan assistance business without regulatory uncertainty and they ensure the sustainable development of our loan assistance business.', 'Furthermore, licensed financial institutions have strict process put in place to prevent defaults. Any default will be reflected on the personal credit report of the borrower issued by the Credit Reference Center, the People’s Bank of China. This will strengthen deterrence against default. We also precise certain competitive edge when it comes to loan assistance business and attracting funding partners.', 'We have extensive experience in borrower acquisition, solid risk management capabilities and strong operational capabilities, derived from our legacy peer-to-peer business. We are very confident about the future growth prospects of our loan assistance business. This new business will drive growth going forward regardless of what regulatory environment finally emerge for the peer-to-peer industry.', 'Josh Vogel', 'My third question, can you tell me please how much is left remaining on the current share repurchased authorization? And maybe discuss your appetite for buying back shares and at what prices would you get aggressive in perhaps repurchasing shares? Thank you.', 'Kerrie Zhang', 'Okay. We have repurchased about 1,160,000 ADS under the share repurchase program so far, representing a total value of approximately $4 mainly. We purchased shares on open market at prevailing market price, depending on number of factors, including but not limited to share price, trading volume and general market conditions, along with our working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. We believe our share repurchase program aligns with the Company’s commitment to maximize shareholder value and demonstrate our confidence and optimism in the long-term future potential of our business and strategy.', 'Josh Vogel', \"And my last question.

As a first mover, we connected our systems and began sharing credit data with Baihang Credit in January this year. We will make regular transfers of credit data to Baihang Credit which integrate and process the data collected to providing individual credit data.', \"On the other hand, we'll leverage the data generated from Baihang Credit to more accurately assess a borrower’s creditworthiness and potentially reduce the cost of risk amendment. Baihang Credit’s platform will greatly enhance our credit services and strengthen compliance. Thank you.\", 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time.

Good morning, George.', 'George Kirby', \"Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone. I'm going to review our business operations and commercialization activities during the first quarter and up to today. Then Matt Shafer will provide a review of our financials, and then we'll open the floor for questions.\", \"I mentioned last quarter that we've had several growth catalysts on the near and mid-term horizon posing significant opportunities for us. In recent weeks, we've seen some of these opportunities take shape for OPT. In early August, we announced the successful deployment of the PB3 PowerBuoy in the North Sea for our customer, Premier Oil. This PowerBuoy is serving Premier Oil as an autonomous, intelligent platform to provide surveillance services throughout the decommissioning process at Premier Oil's Huntington field offshore operations.\", \"During the deployment, we'll demonstrate the PB3 PowerBuoy capabilities, its ability to monitor the local environment and alert ships to the field's position. This deployment began the initial three-month trial of its nine-month lease. We're just over halfway through that initial trial with that PowerBuoy, operating flawlessly in very rough seas with average wave heights of over 17 feet. This lease also includes an option to extend the initial nine-month period.\", 'Before the voyage to the North Sea, the PB3 PowerBuoy was featured at a technology day event we held in Scotland, together with our partners Acteon and The Oil & Gas Technology Centre. Over two days, we had over 100 participants, including oil and gas industry leaders and media that met with our team and saw the PB3 PowerBuoy and its payloads up close to examine its uses and capabilities. The feedback we received was hugely positive, which helps elevate the profile of OPT in the oil and gas industry. The feedback suggests that we have the attention of the offshore oil and gas decommissioning world on this project, and I believe our successful performance for Premier Oil can only help fuel opportunities for our solutions.', 'We recently announced the completion of another detailed feasibility study with a leading oil and gas operator to monitor subsea wells during decommissioning in the Gulf of Mexico. The results of the study were quite compelling. We were able to demonstrate that our solution can successfully provide power for well monitoring in the Gulf in water depths up to 3,000 feet. We defined a solution, which can provide enough power to support the monitoring of two wells at once. This is a major development because it enables us to decouple the decommissioning of subsea assets from that of surface assets such as platforms, which can provide significant cost savings to the customer.', \"With the completion of this feasibility study, this represents a successful first step with this customer and could result in a field trial. Our robust pipeline of opportunities reinforces our confidence in our long-term growth. Over the last few months, we've met with some of our top prospects and they continue to tell us how our solutions could be integral to solving some of their more difficult challenges. Our growing reputation as a leader in remote offshore power and communications is helping us to fill our opportunity pipeline, which now stands at more than 70 leads and opportunities, many of which are in various stages of the proposal process; discover subsea applications in the oil and gas, defense, security, science and research, and telecommunications markets.\", 'Now, let me turn the call over to Matt to discuss the financials, Matt.', 'Matthew Shafer', 'Thank you, George and good morning everyone. We recorded revenues of 202,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 for the period ended July 31, 2019, as compared to 31,000 of revenue for the first quarter of last year. This increase in revenue was the result of our new contracts with Eni, Premier Oil, and the US Navy.', 'Cost of revenues increased $225,000 to $367,000 compared to $142,000 in the three months ended July 31, 2018. The increase in cost of revenues was due to higher upfront spending and material costs on new customer revenue generating products compared to the same period the prior year. The net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $3 million as compared to a net loss of $3.2 million for the prior year period. The decrease in net loss was mainly attributable to the decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs.', 'Turning now to the balance sheet. As of July 31, 2019, total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities were $13.5 million as compared to $17.2 million on April 30, 2019. Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended July 31, 2019 were $3.6 million, a decrease of $0.2 million compared to $3.8 million during the three months ended July 31, 2018.', \"With that, I'll turn it back to George.\", 'George Kirby', \"Thanks, Matt. I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on closing new business for our company. We're actively staffing up our sales team with experienced professionals who can identify and close new business. We're actively working on commercial activities, which we're expecting to close in the near future. I remain extremely optimistic about our prospects and I'm proud of how my team is delivering for our customers. And I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone at OPT who continue to work tirelessly to execute our vision. I'm extremely proud to lead this team at such an exciting time.\", \"With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Victor Aguayo [ph] of ENP Transport [ph]. ', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Thank you. And congratulations on the success that you've been doing at the company so far, which also begs the question how would you expect the success that will impact the current stock market? Thank you.\", 'George Kirby', \"Victor, thanks for the question and thank you for your congratulations although everybody sitting around this table is immensely dissatisfied with our progress. So, we are expecting great things to come. I really can't speak about how it affects the stock price. We have a very diverse investor base, and it's difficult to predict. Sometimes, it's difficult to watch. All that we continue to do is remain laser focused on closing orders. And as I mentioned, we're hiring up great salespeople, people with oil and gas experience, people with defense experience.\", \"We just hired a person in Aberdeen, Scotland, to augment our North Sea operations. That seems like the epicenter of where the commercial activities are really coming from with the Gulf of Mexico seeming to follow close behind here soon, we hope. So, we have a great person with oil and gas experience now in Aberdeen. That makes three people in that area in order to address customer requests and request for information and proposals and so forth. So, that's what we're focused on and really can't speak to the stock price.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Would you like me to move on to the next question?', 'George Kirby', 'Yes, please.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Ruggiere of Dawson James. ', 'Peter Ruggiere', 'Couple questions on the Huntington site or oil field?', 'George Kirby', 'Hey Peter, yes.', 'Peter Ruggiere', \"How many wells are there? I looked at it. It was actually, there's a lot. I just would question why they would only use one PowerBuoy, why wouldn't you need five or six?\", 'George Kirby', \"Well, that's a good question. Huntington field has multiple wells, but right now, Premier Oil asked us to provide topside surveillance, which is above the sea surface. We have -- first of all, let me describe what's going on there. I'm looking at the seas right now on an app of my phone, and it's showing seven-foot seas. When we see an average of seven feet, what it really means is they're seeing 7 to 14 feet, and we continue to operate in this type of weather. So, it's remote, it's overlooking a platform, which is a few miles away.\", \"And the idea is that our PowerBuoy has radar, it has thermal imaging cameras, and it creates this -- what's called augmented reality in the industry through a system back to Premier Oil's headquarters that they're actually watching the site. They can see radar images. They can turn on the camera. They can manipulate the camera. So, they're surveilling topside.\", \"Next step would be to look at subsea and monitoring wells. We provide a lot of this out on social media. I would also mention that you can continue to see information that we're posting there as well. So that's a good question, Peter. But with Huntington field right now, at least from the customer standpoint, we're not focused on monitoring wells yet.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'How -- is anything new going on with MES in Japan?', 'George Kirby', \"There are some new things going on right there. I can't talk about them. I have to say that I'm pretty excited about the direction that this relationship is going with MES. But when I can talk about that, you can be rest assured that I will. And then that begs an important point. There are many small wins with customers that we experience along the way that I can't share, whether it's because maybe its information that shouldn't be shared, maybe the customer would rather ask not to talk about these small wins.\", \"But I'm glad you brought up MES, because we are making important progress with them. And it was a direct result or is a direct result of the time that I spent with them over in July. So, I'm trying to get out in the field more with my sales team more and more to meet with customers. I'll be in the UK next week, meeting with a new customer, a very big potential customer as well as an existing customer to see what more we could do with them and some other folks as well. So, good question.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'On the Gulf of Mexico, on that when would -- what would be the next step? And how many possible buoys, is that market? Because I mean the Gulf of Mexico and I guess the North Sea are the two biggest fields in the world, right?', 'George Kirby', \"Yes. And interestingly from a decommissioning standpoint, the Gulf of Mexico is the largest market in the world, there's that many wells. Now not every well needs our service, not every field needs our PowerBuoys or our solutions, if you will. When are next steps? I can tell you that this operator that we're working with on this, they have multiple opportunities that they're looking at in time in the future. We are trying to target a near-term opportunity, a lot of it has to do with timing, because there's a lot of internal work from the customer’s standpoint that needs to happen.\", \"So, we're doing everything that we can to help them to position us to be used on a future field, the next decommissioning opportunity. If that doesn't happen for whatever reason, they are more behind it. So, I can say multiple wells, multiple systems from OPT over time, and that's one customer. But single customers with applications like this are very, very important, and we're seeing this with Premier Oil. Premier Oil was working with us for years. In fact, they were talking to us when I came on Board back in 2015. They joined our technical advisory panel as we were developing our product, the PB3 PowerBuoy, and they were very interested in providing input. And then they developed this project and put us on it, and now we're executing. We're doing what we said we would do.\", \"The buoy continues to perform very, very well. And eyes are all over this project from throughout the decommissioning market globally. The same thing would happen with this operator in the Gulf of Mexico. So these become showcase projects. They become demonstration projects, but also showcases. And what we're trying to do is we're trying to leverage these showcases to bring customers from around the world to show them what we can do and try to replicate with these other customers. This is the low hanging fruit that we're seeing and that's what we're working hard to replicate in terms of new contracts.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'What type of revenue do you think you guys put together this particular year?', 'George Kirby', \"I wish I could talk about that. We have internal goals. But we're not giving guidance, Peter. But I want to emphasize again, we have definitive internal goals that are broken up by salesperson. Every salesperson has a revenue target. They're being measured on it and they're being resourced around their goals. So we're just not at a point now where we can really outwardly talk about what our revenue targets are.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'And how we many buoys you have available for sale right now?', 'George Kirby', \"Interesting question. We've got more than one buoy in the facility going under at different points of manufacture. We are trying to only build when we need to. The thought was in, and I'll share this. So his is not new news. But we have a buoy on the floor that we're building actually as a spare. And the idea it would be potentially that we would move a finished buoy over to the North Sea, over to be stationed there on land for two reasons. Number one, we're seeking out new contracts there. So it could allow us to deliver that much quicker and have a quicker turnaround. We are always looking at how do we compress the sales cycle that ends up being very, very long.\", \"But number two, if something were to happen to our PowerBuoy, it's all about delivering for to our customer execution and responsiveness. So, we would want to have one positioned there and ready to go. So we're still considering that right now, but that's a thought. We do have another buoy that's in its final state that we have been working with a particular customer on, and we are hoping to have the good news sometime in the future on that one.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'And with Eni up there in the Baltic, are they may be interested in getting another couple of buoys themselves, or they just...?', 'George Kirby', \"That's a great question. Not the Baltic, but it's actually in the Adriatic Sea. We are talking to Eni, I would say, probably weekly about opportunities and they're both near-term opportunities, as well as long-range opportunities. So we're really lucky to have two large customers, like Premier Oil and like NE; two totally different organizations, great; both very good to work with, great -- great partners if you will. But also, both of these organizations are very forward-looking in terms of new technologies and how they can reduce our carbon footprint, how they can do, execute their operations more safely or more efficiently, more cost-effectively. And that's really why they're talking with us and working with us. We are actively trying to find more customers like these two, right now.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'And you said the market for this is how big -- if you get 10% of the market, I think a couple calls backwards, hundreds of millions of dollars you said. Is that good statement or...?', 'George Kirby', \"You know what let me answer it this way. First of all, we want to rebuild our total addressable market study, and we're working to do that. When we first put together our total addressable market, we did it from top-down and that's really because we were limited on information. We were really just launching into our new markets. Today, we've got a much better understanding around our markets and we want to do a bottoms-up. That gives a more detailed and rigorous assessment for investors, and the analysts, and banks, to understand our business. So that's number one.\", \"Number two, if you look at one market segment, decommissioning market segment of the offshore oil and gas market. We've been told by a customer that this is a robust enough, in their eyes that, this is a robust enough market globally that we can build a business around that alone. We estimate that we could potentially apply hundreds and hundreds of PowerBuoys for decommissioning over the next six or seven years. That's how big the market is. And that's only taking a slice of what's actually there. That's assuming a close rate, as you said, of 10% or 15%.\", \"So when you look at one buoy transaction, whether it's a lease or whether it's a sale, it ends up being pretty big dollars, because it's not only the asset that we're putting on lease or that we would sell, but it's also all the service that we're able to provide around that and that we need to provide, because we're the only ones doing this right now. And our customers are recognizing the value of the services that we can provide. So that increases the revenue opportunity as well. \", \"And that's why around that market segment, we feel very, very bullish and we're putting a lot of effort around trying to generate momentum there. And we believe we have momentum with this deployment. With this great event that we had south of Aberdeen, Scotland, we had well over 100 people, I said that earlier. And the interest was beyond our expectations. So I'm glad that we invested in having a buoy stationed there and having this event, having people in. It ended up being a really important marketing event for us, and for our customers to let them know what the solution looks like, what the payloads actually look like when they're integrated on the PowerBuoy.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', \"Sounds like everything's right there right now, that's great.\", 'George Kirby', \"It is. We feel as though it is we are positioned right now where we have to strike, and that's why we're staffing up with the right sales people, people that can hit the ground running that already know the customers that we're calling on. They have relationships. They understand our technology. They understand our value proposition. There's very little ramp up time for the people that we're bringing on Board. And we expect big things from them. It's just the way that it is.\", \"As I mentioned before, everybody -- all of our sales people have a revenue target. Some of them are quite steep in terms of dollar value. But that's more than just expectations around their performance. It's what we're seeing in the market and what we believe the market can bear and what the market needs in terms of our solutions.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', \"You know what when alluded, somebody else asked about the stock price. It's pretty funny as you guys are trading under cash value.\", 'George Kirby', \"Yes, I don't know if I would characterize that as funny, Peter. But I know what you're saying. It's frustrating, right? Because we come here every day and we're executing, we're making progress. But I understand and I share the sentiment of shareholders. We need contracts.\", 'Peter Ruggiere', 'Right. But you sound pretty close. Anyway, thank you.', 'George Kirby', 'Thank you, Peter. Appreciate the dialog.', 'Operator', \"[Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\", 'George Kirby', \"Thank you, Operator.

I'd like to open the call today with an update on our INM-755 program for the treatment of Epidermolysis Bullosa, or EB. As you may recall, earlier in the year we announced the transition of our EB program to a single cannabinoid formulation, rather than a two cannabinoid approach. This single cannabinoid product is referred to as INM-755.\", 'We’re in the process of finalizing over 20 clinical trial application enabling preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies. The results of which are required for the regulatory filing begin human clinical trials later this calendar year. We are on track with all studies and are actively integrating the study outcome into the regulatory filing.', 'Over the course of the summer, we determined that conducting initial human clinical trials in the Netherlands afforded the company the best probability of adhering to our aggressive drug development timelines. The regulatory review time and process in the Netherlands is well-established and we have selected a host site for the trials that has significant experience and access to a large volunteer population.', 'The initial human studies will be comprised of two separate studies. Study number 755-101-HV is a healthy volunteer study, designed to establish the systemic and local safety in pharmacokinetics of INM-755 on intact in. We will be testing two strings of INM-755 in about 20 healthy adult volunteers. This study is double blinded and vehicle controlled.', 'The second study, number 755-102-HV will focus on local safety on wounds in a small number of subjects, again using two different drugs concentrations. These two initial studies will be conducted in series. The 101 intact skin study is scheduled for initiation prior to the end of the calendar year and initiation and treatment of patients in the 102 study is anticipated to take place the second to third quarter of calendar 2020.', \"It's important to mention that, once the healthy initial -- the initial healthy volunteer studies are completed, the company will then be positioned to explore additional indications or uses for INM-755 topical cream beyond to just EB.\", \"This significant investment of both time and money that we've made into the product in the form of numerous formulations, developments, toxicology studies can be leveraged into other dermatological conditions that may benefit from 755, which may include reduction in inflammation, pain, and itch.\", \"We're currently exploring the initiation of preclinical studies to understand these benefits in other disease models, and look forward to providing additional information in due course.\", \"Assuming there are no untoward outcomes in the healthy volunteer studies, we currently anticipate following a regulatory application for the Phase I/II study in EB patients in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020. This multinational study will be a safety and efficacy study in EB patients' of all subtypes.\", \"Alexandra Mancini, InMed's Senior Vice President of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs as well as Michael Woudenberg, our VP of CMC will be available at the conclusion of the formal presentation for Q&A on the EB program.\", 'Now switching to glaucoma, since our last quarterly update, the company has formally switched from INM-085 to a new candidate for the ocular program named INM-088. The 088 is a single cannabinoid product, which in subsequent preclinical testing proved to confer specific advantages over 085, in terms of in-vitro results for the potential to treat glaucoma.', \"We're targeting the potential effects of this cannabinoid to both reduce intraocular pressure as well as provide neuroprotection for the retinal ganglion cells and other optic nerve tissues.\", \"Based on the results we've seen thus far, we are very enthusiastic, that this product candidate may have effects, well beyond just glaucoma. We are moving to advanced preclinical testing in the second half of 2019 to further understand the pharmacological activity of this cannabinoid. We're also testing, other drug delivery formulations in addition to our own Hydrogel to ensure that we select the most promising delivery technology.\", 'Looking into next year, we anticipate completing formulation development, and proof-of-concept in-vivo studies in the first half of 2020. Thereafter, we expect that we will be in a position to commence clinical trial enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The company will provide additional updates on this program early next year.', \"As with INM-755 in dermatology, we believe that INM-088 -- its product characteristics that we've seen in early testing maybe beneficial across a number of different ocular diseases.\", \"Now, I'd like to turn your attention to the biosynthesis program. InMed's aim is to build and sustain a leadership position in cannabinoid manufacturing. At this point, we continue to retain all rights in commercial upside for our bacterial biofermentation system with only a small royalty going to the University of British Columbia.\", \"During the quarter ended, 30th of June 2019, we continued on a path forward scale up of our biosynthesis process. We've optimized several fermentation parameters in order to maximize production yield. Such parameters include, but aren’t limited to the inducer concentration induction time, aperture, media time and incubation time. We believe we have most of these parameters nailed down.\", 'However, we still require a little more time to finalize some other conditions. As we scale up fermentation to larger vessel, some of these conditions will still need to be slightly modified to fit the various vessel sizes. We also initiated the downstream purification work with various contract organizations. This process is still on track to be completed by the end of 2019.', 'As mentioned in our last quarterly call, we are also exploring an alternative biosynthesis manufacturing process in addition to our existing E.coli biosynthesis process, which may confer certain benefits either costs, yield, speed, or all of the above when pursuing specific types of cannabinoids.', \"We are agnostic, as to which pathway we’ll eventually commercialize and we’ll continue to follow where our innovation leads us as we continue to build a leadership position in the space. We're in the process of filing provisional patents on this new approach, and we'll be in a position to provide further details over the course of 2020.\", 'Note that Dr. Eric Hsu, InMed Senior Vice President of Preclinical R&D is available during the Q&A session to answer questions related to the INM-088 program, and the biosynthesis program.', \"Now for a general quarter update.

He replaces Jeff Charpentier who has diligently served as CFO for the last several years. Jeff will continue to support the company as a VP of Finance.', \"We also departure of Josh Blacher, who served as our Chief Business Officer for 18 months. Josh was recruited back in the Investment Management Industry in New York City with what he referred to as an offering he just can't refuse. We wish him all the best and we look forward to a lasting relationship with him and his new employer.\", \"Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our new CFO, Bruce Colwill for a review of the financials.\", 'Bruce Colwill', \"Thanks Eric, and thank you all for joining today's call. As, you know, this is my first quarterly call since starting with this mid-last month, and I'm very excited to be on board. The talent that Eric has brought together to develop InMed asset is really quite impressive, absolutely from the perspective of their experience, but also because of the passion for what the Company's trying to accomplish. So I'm really pleased to be here.\", \"So moving on, I would like to remind you that the figures I will present in today's call are expressed in Canadian dollars. Also please recall that our fiscal year end is June 30th. So together with our quarterly financials, I'll also be reporting on today's call our full-year fiscal 2019 financials. Please note that the complete financial statements and MD&A are also available on our website under the Investors tab as well of course on SEDAR.\", 'So operationally, I will first touch on our research and development activities. R&D expenses were CAD2.45 million for the three months ended June 30th, 2019 compared to CAD580,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Well for the 12 months ended June 30th, 2019, our R&D expenses totaled CAD5.64 million, compared with CAD1.93 million for full year fiscal 2018. This substantial increase in R&D expense is primarily due to increase in spending on those preclinical safety pharmacology and tox studies for INM-755, which, as Eric mentioned earlier, are required for the regulatory filing to initiate human clinical trials later this year.', 'In addition, in advance of our planned clinical trials, we incurred higher costs with the purchase of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in INM-755. As well, we incurred higher R&D personnel compensation as a result of increased R&D staffing.', 'Looking now at our G&A activities. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, G&A expenses were approximately CAD1 million for each of the three months ended June 30th, 2019 and 2018. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2019, G&A expenses totaled CAD3.80 million, which compares with CAD3.37 million for the corresponding period of 2018. The increase in G&A costs for the year was primarily results of increased staffing cost, reflective of our expanded R&D efforts in general operations.', 'So in total, for the three and 12 months ended June 30, 2019, we recorded a net loss of CAD4.27 million and CAD13.26 million, or CAD0.02 and CAD0.08 per share respectively. This compares with a net loss of CAD3 million and CAD8.5 million or CAD0.02 and CAD0.06 per share for the three and 12 months ended June 30, 2018.', 'It is important to note that of that CAD13.26 million comprehensive loss for fiscal 2019, approximately CAD4 million of that was related to non-cash share based payments related to stock options. The cash used in operations for full year 2019 was just under CAD9 million.', 'So shifting now to our balance sheet. As at June 30, 2019, our cash and short-term investments total CAD18 million, a decrease of CAD8.4 million during the year. This decrease was largely driven by the CAD8.8 million cash outflow from operating activities during the year that I just mentioned, which was partially offset by CAD273,000 of proceeds from the exercised stock options.', \"As at 30 June 2019, the company's total issued and outstanding shares were approximately 172 million and on a fully diluted basis, 223 million. In early July, subsequent to our fiscal year, a total of approximately 14 million warrants fired unexercised reducing the fully diluted share counts.\", 'Over this coming year, we will be funding a continually increase in R&D spend, as we continue the development of our drug product candidate, including the preclinical and early clinical program, for INM-755.', 'The formulation preclinical development for INM-088 and further scale up of biosynthesis program, among other R&D. Taking this increased spend into account, we expect that our cash reserves are sufficient to last for approximately the end of the third quarter of calendar 2020.', \"With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Adams for questions-and-answers session. And as a reminder, Eric Adam, Alexandra Mancini, Eric Hsu, Michael Woudenberg will also be available for questions. Joan?\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Max Jacobs from Edison Group. Please go ahead.', 'Max Jacobs', 'Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondered why did you have to break up the Phase I into two parts? And is it possible to do those in parallel in order to save time?', 'Eric Adams', \"It's a good question. Thank you, Max. Alex, I'll throw that one over to you.\", 'Alexandra Mancini', 'Okay. Thank you. Yeah. It is a good question. Well, first of all, the -- as Eric has explained the first study will be on intact skin, the second one on wounded skin. So, it is important to do intact skin first and not to be doing them in parallel.', 'We will learn information about the tolerability of the product on the intact skin. And that will inform us as to the suitability of -- on the wounded skin as well. So, we have to do the good skin before the bad skin, so to speak.', 'And then one additional consideration was that for -- just in terms of what -- you know that we had a choice to whether can put them in one protocol just Parts A and B or whether to split them out as two studies.', \"And we've chosen to split them out as two studies, because it allows us to move more quickly. It takes a little bit longer from a manufacturing perspective to make the sterile cream that would be required for the wounded skin application. For intact skin, we don't need sterile cream.\", \"So we can move faster and that's what we're doing by splitting the trials. It is putted into two trials rather than a Part A and B, the two parts always would have to be separated anyway, though, because of the safety considerations, we have to do the intact skin before we do the broken skin. Does that answer your question?\", 'Max Jacobs', \"Yes it does. That actually makes perfect sense. And then also I just want -- so you're going through The Netherlands. So, I was just wondering what that means with regards to like the CTA and the IND in terms of timing of that filing?\", 'Alexandra Mancini', \"Okay. Thank you for that question too. I can clarify that. So, yes, we are filing in the Netherlands. Their process is called a Clinical Trial Application. The IND language that we all use sort of as a generic term is really specific to the U.S. application. So, a Clinical Trial Application in The Netherlands is quite a good and simple process and it is a very well-defined process, well-defined timelines and it's very quick.\", 'The Ethics Committee will be reviewing in parallel with the Health Authority, the National Health -- we call the National competent authority in the Netherlands. They will review everything in parallel, and therefore the oversight is quite quick. And in the Netherlands, we do not need any further reviews to support cannabinoids, whereas, in some other jurisdictions you often need a license to deal with cannabinoids. So the Netherlands is a more friendly environment for working with this class of compound.', 'Max Jacobs', 'Okay, great. And so for like the Phase I, II in EB patients will that be done still in the Netherlands? Is it going to be in like the U.S. or Canada? And so just when will those filings that will enable those studies happen?', 'Alexandra Mancini', \"Yes. That's another good question. Thanks. That one will have to be a global trial, because EB is a very rare disease and we would need to enroll in many centers around the world. And, therefore, we will be putting in multiple regulatory applications for that.\", \"One might think, why does it take so long to do -- go from the healthy volunteer studies to go into the EB patients? And it's because of the required process for filing these applications globally. We have to have the full data base. For example, you have to submit the clinical trial reports, but not only the reports, but the full databases as well in the U.S. as the full electronic submission. And -- but each country has their own requirements.\", \"So our regulatory applications will go in, somewhat in parallel, but they will be processed on different schedules and the sites will eventually for the EB trial will start up at different times globally. So we believe we, put together an aggressive schedule here for our program, but we're confident that we can make these timelines.\", 'Max Jacobs', 'And so you would expect kind of like the global filings to be completed by like around fourth quarter of 2020?', 'Alexandra Mancini', 'Yes.', 'Max Jacobs', 'Okay. Okay, great. Thanks Alexandra. That definitely answers my questions.', 'Alexandra Mancini', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is from Jerry Isaacson from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead.', 'Jerry Isaacson', 'Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Certainly I want to start by congratulating you on the addition of Catherine and Bruce to the team. Definitely looks like very nice additions, and is appreciated.', \"Next thing is, last time we spoke, there was not enough expertise on the call, and Eric you promised to bring in the team this time, and so I really appreciate that. So I’m going to start by directing a question to the other Eric. And one of the things I wanted to talk about before is, if you could talk, there's a lot of hype around the yeast biosynthesis of cannabinoids right now and you're obviously focused on the bacterial side. And I wonder if you could just talk to me about the differences that you see and maybe why you see advantages in the E. coli synthesis?\", 'Eric Hsu', \"Thanks for the question Jerry. So, yes, you're correct. There are a lot of hypes around the E system for good reason, but if you look historically, a lot of biological product that's used now are being produced in E.coli. So there is a lot of knowhow in terms of scale-up, in terms of downstream process, that's all been developed with a bacterial fermentation. And as we were able to show that the cannabinoid can be produced in E.coli, it was an obvious choice for us to go after.\", \"I'll give you a good example is that, if you look at E.coli fermentation, time that's required to produce a batch is significantly less than the yeast timeline. So, that gives advantage when we go into the clean room to produce these drug products -- drug substance. Thank you.\", 'Jerry Isaacson', \"So, Eric, what sort of milestones should we be looking for potentially in the next year or so that would tell us that, whether it'd be InMed or whether it'd be somebody else that tells us that there's significant progress being made?\", 'Eric Adams', \"Yes, I'll take that one. Thanks, Jerry. Well, I mean, we continue to make pretty significant progress here and I think we may be one of the few companies that are actually in the process of scaling up to commercial scale. So, we have a couple of key milestones that we want to hit by the end of this year, in terms of locking in the upstream process, which is the fermentation process.\", \"We want to lock those parameters down at larger scale. And we also want to finalize what the downstream purification process is. So, once you ferment, and have the broth, you need to separate out the drug from everything else and that's the purification process.\", \"So we're working with a couple of pharmaceutical contract manufacturers to identify and solidify those processes. We're on track to complete that by the end of the year. And we also mentioned that we're looking at alternatives to what we would say is traditional biosynthesis and our R&D efforts have led us down a path to say, well, there may be another way to do this.\", \"And so, we're pursuing that as well and we should be in a position to kind of decide, one way or the other, whether we stay with the traditional process or the alternative process by the end of the year. Based on which way we go, then we'll be scaling up towards commercial scale next year. So, I don't have any specific dates I could give you. I mean, its science, it doesn't always adhere to the timelines we wish, but we're making great progress on that program right now.\", 'Jerry Isaacson', \"So Eric, I'm intrigued, you're mentioning this new approach, anything else that you might be able to say about it.\", 'Eric Adams', \"Well, I'll turn it over to the other Eric who's in charge of that program. We'll let him handle that one.\", 'Eric Hsu', \"Thanks, Jerry. So, while we're scaling up the biosynthesis process, we discovered that there is actually a ceiling with the whole system. That's with regard to how much protein or some of these protein it produce and how much cannabinoid it can generate.\", \"And that's because some of these cannabinoid could be toxic to themselves. So, we will refer to the limitation or dislimitation as a biological burden. So the threshold actually exists, regardless if it's E.Coli the host or yeast or algae. So it's going to be there. So because of this, we actually spend a lot of time optimizing fermentation parameter in order to just increase the cell mass in general.\", \"Working with one of our contract research organizations, we discussed how to overcome these kind of constraints with a bio burden and we discover that there may be a better way just to produce the overall production yield. Of course right now we're working through the provisional stage of the pattern. So, I'm not in the liberty to go in the details on the alternate process. But rest assured that we're actually working both on the traditional and alternate bio fermentation process in parallel right now.\", 'And then we are -- we already invested and -- in the E.coli fermentation and have a lot of intellectual property and know-how surrounding that. So, our first choice will be continue with the E.coli process even applied to the new approach. Thank you.', 'Jerry Isaacson', \"Okay, great. Yeah, no that's actually really great detail, I appreciate that. So, I hope you don't mind I have a couple more questions. I'm going to take advantage of everybody who's on the call today.\", 'Eric Hsu', 'Sure, go ahead.', 'Jerry Isaacson', \"So, Ms. Mancini what I'm curious about is how is the EB community kind of connected? Because I know it's a rare disease and kind of what are the centers-of-excellence? And how do you kind of organize the community? Is there -- a patient advocacy group that you're working with? I just wonder if you give me a little background on that.\", 'Alexandra Mancini', \"Yeah, that's a great question. Thank you. It's always as you can imagine that's the basis of your question, I'm sure. It's always a challenge and an orphan indication to pull it together when you do a global trial. But one really important and positive situation here for the EB community is that they are already very well-connected and there is a group called Debra -- D-E-B-R-A International. And if you go to their website you will see that the umbrella organization Debra is, sort of, Dystrophic EB Research Association -- is one version of the acronym and they have coordinated and now in many countries of the world, there is a local Debra organization as well.\", \"And they are very focused on patient support and connecting families to medical care in their community because it's very hard for the families to know where to get help. And basically the Debra Groups are amazing to work with and they will be definitely part of our group that we work with as we go forward to roll-out the clinical trial.\", \"There is a -- Congress and an international Congress for EB coming in January of 2020 and our company is a sponsor of one of many, but we are a sponsor of that Congress in London, England. And at that time -- excuse me, we will be able to be meeting investigators from all over the world. They'll be coming for that. This will be a great Congress because it will be the first time they're holding one meeting which is directed at the physicians and also the patients and their families, and the basic researcher, so it's all areas of EB be coming together.\", \"So, we will be definitely meeting with investigators at that meeting and starting to discuss our clinical trial. That's a lot of lead-time before the regulatory applications will go in the second half of the year. So, that's good. We're getting a good head start on that.\", 'Jerry Isaacson', \"Well, now that was much more information than expected. Thank you. I appreciate that. No -- and yeah, hopefully, I'll be able to attend. So, I also -- because since I have -- since he's on the call, I want to nail-down Mike, a little bit too. I think that at the end of the day, you can't control your efficacy or your safety, but you can control your CMC. And so I was hoping that Mike would maybe give us an update on, kind of, everything that you're doing to make sure that as the trials progress that that's an area that we don't have to worry about?\", 'Michael Woudenberg', \"Sure. Yeah. Thanks for question, Jerry. So, with regards to supply for our materials, so we've spend a considerable amount of effort and resources in terms of finding contractors, who could support our drug development program, but also our API supply.\", \"So with regards to the cannabinoid or API supply, I’ve identified and setup a primary and a backup supplier for that. This required a lot of effort, there's within the industry for cannabinoid supplies and GMP. There’s a limited number of companies, who can support such efforts. We identified two of those as a primary and backup and we now have a supply of GMP material that's scalable to our clinical through the commercial development programs for that.\", \"On the drug product supply, we've also established relationships with testing labs and also manufacturers to support the drug product for our Phase I, and that is on track to meet our trials for this year.\", 'Jerry Isaacson', \"Okay. Perfect. Yeah, I've already taken up enough of all of your time. Like I said before, I appreciate you making so many members of the team available. Thanks for taking my questions.\", 'Eric Adams', \"Thank you, Jerry. We've got some questions that were submitted online. I'd like to address one of those now. There was some question about, when our patents will issue and what the status for various patents are?\", \"And it's awfully difficult to project that kind of thing. So I thought Eric, maybe you could take a minute or two just to talk about what the process is. And why we can't really predict when they're going to be issued but where we are in the process.\", 'Eric Hsu', \"Thank you. Thank you for the question. Just to follow-up, Eric's comment from last week from New York, InMed's building important suite of patent portfolio to protect our technology and our product. So this is also augmented with a significant amount of knowhow that's proprietary to the company.\", \"So, just briefly talking about the patent process, after entity like InMed, feel like we're creating something inventive. That means, it's either novel or non obviousness then we typically file a provisional patent application.\", \"The provisional patent is a ways for an entity protect its invention, beginning with the date that's file. The process also allow the entity to basically have another 12 months to produce additional supported information for the patent application. After the 12 months, we will then typically convert the provisional into a Patent Cooperation Treaty call a PCT applications. The PCT system is that -- for filing a patent is actually recognized simultaneous by numerous country around the world. So the application then will be hidden for about 18 months before it was actually published.\", \"Now, the PCT application is filed. The International Search Authority will initially conduct the written opinion based on the prior searches. It's important to keep in mind that these opinions are not necessarily going to be used by various patent office. Normally the different patent office will form their own opinions, once the patent office forms, these opinions, they'll then contact the inventor or the entity regarding the patent, and they go through a process called office action.\", 'The applicant then will have opportunity to address specific novelty, or obviousness questions or concerns raised by the patent office. This process can go back and forth several rounds, so it could -- the entire process of patenting could take up to few years.', \"So, currently we anticipate that several of our PCT patents will start to receive [indiscernible] from various jurisdictions that we file. In addition, we have several other provisional applications that are still not converted to PCT yet. So because the process is so long, it's really difficult for us to predict when will we start to receive allowances for these patents at this time.\", 'Eric Adams', \"So we've got several in process. We’ve got several in the queue. We've got several provisionals that we're going to roll over into PCTs, and many more behind that. So I think it's important that we continue to build this portfolio of know-how and proprietary know-how, and that's going to help protect the company and the commercialization of its product. So, it's never a sure bet, but we're in the process and we just have to keep plugging away at getting those things move forward.\", \"There was one other question, I'll just take briefly from -- that was submitted online. Someone sent in a question about our bioinformatics platform and when we plan to monetize that through licensing. So, I think, the easy answer is, that's not something that we're pursuing right now.\", \"We had the opportunity in the past, in discussions with another company, to out-license this kind of know-how and what occurred to us very quickly is that, there's no way to really protect it. So once you let us know-how out of the barn, you can't harness it anymore. And whoever has it can then kind of run with it and do whatever they want. It's very difficult to control.\", \"So what we decided back then was that, we wouldn't be licensing any know-how, but we will license patents down the road. Once you have a patent that kind of restricts someone's ability to work in your space. It's much easier to control what they do or don't do with that know-how.\", \"So we're going to take our know-how. We're going to patent it, and once we have the patents then we'll be in a position to talk about licensing opportunities or other ways of monetizing our internal know-how. So, no immediate plans on anything with the bioinformatics platform.\", 'Okay, I think we could take another question.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question on the phone is from George Ingram from Ingram Initiative Incorporated. Please go ahead.', 'George Ingram', \"Good afternoon. And in regards to your capital and raising capital, I see that we've got 2020 warrants coming up. Does that look like a viable option to help you? Or do you foresee additional capital raises?\", 'Eric Adams', \"I believe those warrants are priced at CAD1.25, so I would be thrilled if those were actually converted into shares, which we would have to be above CAD1.25 for anyone to want to do that. We endeavour on a daily basis to get up to that level, but right now, I'd have to say, that might be a remote possibility, just depending on what happens in the markets.\", \"Absent that, we're considering other avenues towards acquiring additional capital. I don’t know, Bruce, if you maybe want to touch on that a little bit.\", 'Bruce Colwill', \"Yes, sure. I mean, I touched on it earlier in the call that, we ended the quarter or the fiscal year with CAD18 million on the balance sheet. So the bottom line, we're reasonably well positioned right now, sort of looking down the pipe, as far as what we're working on with the three programs that the rest the teams already covered off. We're certainly going to be able to progress those with the capital that we have on the balance sheet today.\", \"That being said, now if there's an opportunity to bring additional capital on the balance sheet, opportunistically, then certainly we would absolutely consider that. That might take the form of an additional equity offering. Although, we're very cognizant of our share price, potentially looking at, if there's a little third party strategic investment or while it's less likely potentially licensing opportunity. So, I mean -- we're right now with 2018 on the balance sheet. We're feeling okay, but we continue to monitor absolutely.\", 'George Ingram', 'Excellent. And then the second question I would like to ask is in regards to your delivery system, your Hydrogel formation, you mentioned that you are considering other. Could you talk a little bit more? Is that a licensable technology as well?', 'Eric Adams', \"Well, we continue to develop that. But as we are heading towards more advanced preclinical testing for 088, we certainly want to make sure that we have the best delivery technology, one that is adequate and patent-protected. So, we're actually looking at a couple other delivery technologies and we're going to be comparing those head-to-head with our Hydrogel technology.\", \"I think it's a nice, it's a very refined approach, the Hydrogel, but it's hard to say whether it's the best and that's going to come down to the ability to deliver drug over the timeframe needed into the eye. So, it's still in the hopper, but we want to make sure we make the best decision for the product.\", 'George Ingram', 'Okay. Thank you all very much.', 'Eric Adams', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. We have no further questions on the phone. You may proceed.', 'Eric Adams', 'Great. Well, I want to thank everyone for taking the time today. The company continues to make really good progress both in terms of the scientific advancement as well as building the team out for what lies ahead and being able to execute on that.', \"So, I think as Bruce said we're in a good position from a cash perspective, we're able to go very aggressively after the opportunities that are in front of us and we look forward to updating you next time on the advancements and the milestones that we reach. So, thank you everyone very much.\", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.'], ['Rocket Internet SE (OTC:RCKZF) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call September 19, 2019  4:00 AM ET', 'Corporate Participants', 'Bettina Curtze - SVP Finance & Investment', 'Oliver Samwer - CEO', 'Alexander Schlomberg - Managing Director and Co-Founder at ExpertLead', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Nikolas Mauder - Kepler Cheuvreux', 'Sarah Simon - Berenberg', 'Marcus Diebel - JPMorgan', 'John King - Bank of America', 'Oliver Samwer', \"Okay. Thank you very much for joining us this morning in London to our capital markets day and an update on the company and its strategy. So it takes us to look at the current state of selected companies. As you know Jumia is still a big investment of ours. It's a company that we founded many years ago; it's now public in New York.\", 'I think, [indiscernible] stake in the company, we own still about 17% of the company. We own about 11% of Home & Living and GFG that listed in Frankfurt we still own 18%. So, those are kind of like our remaining larger public holdings.', \"If you look at how do they develop? I think Jumia, you clearly see with a very, very strong growth. Africa will continue to be a market where people do come online. We have a lot of e-commerce transactions. And I think what you should not underestimate Jumia is extremely strong also in payment. They have such a strong position and if you look what Alibaba did with Alipay and look what eBay did PayPal once you have a very strong e-commerce platform, it's very easy to push your payment solution.\", \"And Jumia pay is making great progress and the company's rolling out, if you follow their announcements, to more and more countries and we feel very confident about the dominance of this company. I think that the market share of this company is extremely high. And I think they're going to be just like other companies like Flipkart in India or Amazon in the rest of the world or Alibaba. I think those models are really horizontal platform on which you can build more and more services over time. And I think that's clearly a number one in Africa.\", \"If you look at Global Fashion. I think you could see also very strong domain, very strong business in Asia Pacific, Australia with iconic [indiscernible] very strong business in Latam, [indiscernible] and very strong business in Russia. So, I think, again, I think what we feel very good about is the dominance of this business. I think the share price is very low, but I think basically if you look at it the trading volume is extremely small. So, I don't think that is necessarily representative of the performance of the company. I think the company itself had a 16% constant FX, in the same time improving significantly its negative EBITDA margin. And I encourage you to have a talk with Patrick, one of the CEOs who before run also Asia Pacific. I think you can also see the depth and the quality of the management when you talk to Patrick or Christoph.\", \"So, I think we feel very good there. Home & Living, I think it's all known about kind of the challenges the business went through. I think it's now on the recovery path. If one reads kind of what they [indiscernible] say in the public market, I think we feel good that the company will recover. It still might be in total, still maybe six to 12 months to get to its original strength. But, also there we feel company is making good progress. So, I think Jumia and GFG clearly on strong growth trajectory and strong progress. And I think Home 24 after the recovery also making progress.\", \"If you look at kind of like EBITDA margin, I think you see Global Fashion at only minus five. I think Jumia is different game because basically this is really about capturing the whole market and Home 24, I think if you look at the announcements, I think there is a positive trend despite what you see here. I think it's more future oriented.\", \"Especially GFG, I think we should not always only look at revenue or GMV. I encourage you to look strongly in GFG, but also in Jumia for order because orders, if you focus has the company more relevant, how relevant can I be for customer -- for our customer, it really matters more the audit. And I think that many people underestimate because basically to be more relevant to the customer, you need to also give him access to lower priced items. And therefore, it's much more important that kind of the customer or out of all fashion orders whatever gives 20% of the fashion orders to you. And therefore, you also need to give them access to t-shirts or short pants or something that might have a lower average order value than your traditional goods. But the relevance is extremely good and I think that is also, when you later look at Jumia, I think in general number of audit is extremely important because it's just as dominance in market share. It's about the relevance for the end customer.\", 'And you see that same thing when you look at Amazon, you know, today they deliver you even a few pence or something, things that are basically whatever $10, $5, $15 items or something is missing for your computer or something because they wanted to be relevant. They want when you think of buying. They want you to think of Amazon. The same as when you think of buying something, Jumia wants to think, to have you think of Jumia and GFG wants to have you think of GFG. So, I think a very, very important metric.', 'Jumia, you see it here, testament think customers, I think there is in print here, the orders, but I think the company makes its own announcement. I think also in Jumia, yes, originally there was also some third-party business. You see the strong growth in the marketplace revenues. I think the company has extremely, when you look at their last presentation has a very diverse set of revenue streams from marketplace rather than use to advertising revenues something that you see kind of Amazon driving also lot to logistics revenues to, fulfillment revenues. So, I think the company has really a very diverse set, when you see the strong growth of almost 100% in the marketplace revenue and the GMV.', \"Home 24, as we talked about it that I think the company is on a recovery mode. You see that also with growing -- with an 18% revenue growth, 21% in numbers, what most people don't know it has a very strong Latin American business also and that is growing 38% at constant currency. The business primarily in Brazil and extremely strong there.\", \"So, I think as we discussed in -- probably our last analyst call, I think the reality is and I think is that the pipeline of young companies is growing, but kind of in the middle. I think of companies that basically are over the medium size is rather small. So, we do not expect to lift very soon a company to the selected companies because basically we have selected companies that went now public. But most other promising companies are small still in size and therefore there will be kind of a people ask us about what's your next public company, what's your next thing, I think people need to be patient. We do not expect in 2019 or '20 to lift a company out of -- our young companies because they need time to develop and you really need to hear Alex, with ExpertLead, the leading freelancer community and I think he would share with you. Those are all wonderful models making extremely progress, but those are not 2019 or 2020 candidates for public listing or for big M&A transaction or anything of that kind which can crystallize clearly the value for our shareholders.\", 'You see, however, the overall activity is very big. We launched large number of models in 2018, but all of those companies like in the past no different to the past take a long time. We do have complementary investments in private companies. And we for transparency reason, we give you an overview here. At the same time, I would say the values you should always take with a lot of caution because they are really subject to significant limitation, which should not be read as an indication of the price that third parties would be willing to pay in future financing loan, the potential trade sale or potential initial public offering. Because you see with Uber or with an [indiscernible] and on the other side with Slack or [Zoom] [ph] that sometimes private relations and public relations are just very difficult to forecast. Yes. On the one side with Uber and [indiscernible], you have valuations below the last private more or less with Slack and [Zoom] [ph]. For example, you had valuations that the significant and public markets could be higher than the private market.', \"And, therefore, I think in today's environment, it's very difficult to clearly put the value of a private company. And therefore, I think we look much more at the operational progress at revenue, number of orders GMV, SaaS revenues or whatever and less at those values. And I think, we can't tell you, if the total cost is closer to the value of them or the right-hand side because I think in the end those companies are still young, you have to prove their market, you have to prove their dominance and we just will always quarterly update you there. And the most has to do with [lapsed] [ph] funding loans and fair value valuation. But I think this is the set of opportunities, but I think the total value of that, it's difficult to determine.\", \"If you look at the consulted IFRS, I think we all know that the representation is very limited. I think where do the profits come from, obviously, from the sale of shares especially [indiscernible] others. So, our expectation is not that you're going to see the same in the next six or twelve months because many of the assets that we had crystallized and therefore it's not that we have a constant flow of capital gains, no constant flow of other operational strong income.\", 'I think we have many smaller boats and we do have the capital to support them to operationally support them, to fund them to help them on the IT and also invest in them. And our position currently is that we have €3 billion in net cash roughly 300 million to 400 million public stock. Yes, recently shares have gone down. I mean you can -- we showed your our main shareholdings and this is our numbers as of August 31.', 'Yes, it can be 300 million, it can be 200 million, it can be 500 million, but public stock, I think is very transparent because we show you what we own. And then, we have in our [indiscernible] lending business another 200 million roughly.', 'So, you look at roughly maybe 3.5 billion, 3.4 billion, 3.6 billion of liquid -- relatively liquid cash. And I think going forward like in the past some of that money will go into our existing businesses. Some of that will be into new business that we found, some of that will be into new businesses where we can take potentially like deliver euros and like that, a significant position. Some of that potentially can also go into public companies. I think we will watch the market. And I think the strength of the team is very strong. We have a number of offices, I think we see more opportunities, but we find ourselves at the point where generally asset prices are not cheap.', \"I think the likelihood that it gets better from here is maybe [Technical Difficulty] everyone is very subjective and nobody knows, but probably maybe the expectation like the likelihood that gets better from here, which is already very good times probably lower than the likelihood that gives the less good compared to day. But, you know, with all that quantitative easing and so on, you probably know more about it than we. I would say one doesn't know, so let's make sure we have always enough capital and I think it's less actually about the market for us. It's more about finding the right thing.\", \"I think it could be -- look at many opportunities and just did not do them because of price, probably not. I think most had to do with -- we just [indiscernible] the level of conviction to put a lot of our capital yet or the need because many of the young companies are still young and don't need that capital. So what is and we always very transparent with our investors is that this I think last year compared it like a drug pipeline. We do not have those drugs that are kind of very close to becoming the next blockbuster because it's kind of like you have lots of young companies that still need to be tested in the marketplace, that still take many years to develop.\", \"And we are exceeding the ground by building more companies for the future. But there's no [indiscernible] show what about company with hundreds of millions of sales and so on. That's why you are going to lift one to the select companies for quite a long time.\", \"So, our strategy has not changed at all. It is the same strategy. The big companies, so we're very focused on companies from scratch building companies putting teams together, putting ideas together, putting working with them operationally to make them better in our core markets. I think our core markets are Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Africa or Australia, little less U.S. and very, very little China. And in our network, we basically also make complementary investments and we support the company, so and so, do that. \", 'I think what is clearly changed in the five years, they now, basically five years more or less public. I think what has changed is diversity. So, very risky, there probably a very consumer tech 90%, consumer tech business in 2014.', 'In five years, we changed a lot and we have now many B2B businesses. You see basically number of sector B2B is a bigger consumer tech [indiscernible] today. I think our team, this is skilled in soft.', '[indiscernible] we have invested in a great company called [indiscernible] in Munich which is a software business, very fast growing, very strong dominant. In fintech, we are [indiscernible] we were in funding circle, we are in [indiscernible]. So, kind of we have a very strong, horizontal knowledge base to-date, so that would also makes us confident for the future. I think in the last two years, I see we invested a lot in building the foundation for 2025 basically where we really have good companies across many, many sectors. Property tech is obviously another strong base of our food tech, travel tech, but I would say especially B2B fintech they continue to grow. And I think we have the team to do that.', \"So, I think we don't create stories meaning we don't feel that in a transparent communication, one should just kind of like put a big vision on something. I think our situation is very clear. We have a significant cash position. We have many, roughly, whatever like 100-plus young companies -- when I mean young, means companies that are primarily probably between 3 and 5 years away from crystallization of value, have may sometimes even longer. But I think on average probably more like to the 4, 5 years on average and that makes us feel content for the long-term future.\", \"In the mid-term future, basically actually a few things that can change, but primarily -- we will not have a lot of surprises there. And I think the rest will all be very opportunistically if the markets change, or if a great company comes across us, we will make the necessary decisions, investments, but I would say it's a continuous development and not surprises to come.\", \"I think that's why we didn't put you up another 50 slides or something because I think the -- the situation is very clear and I think we delivered in the past. That's why we're also confident about the future. And if we make any large investment, or if we make any or if you see any company completely outperforming and crystallizing value or something, we will report that to the market anyway. Otherwise, I think it's for the next three years for sure kind of very continuous progress of our company.\", 'So, I think before we go, will have [indiscernible] present ExpertLead. I think we have today more time to go in questions that you want to get answers and things we can help you better understand our company. So I think we open up for any questions. I think we have to use the mic, so the people in the phone can also use it. I think the colleague have a mic over here. Any questions?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Andrew Ross', \"Thanks. It's Andrew from Barclays. Maybe just two to get started. I guess first one as you sold out of quite a few [your listed stakes] [ph] this year, so maybe just a comment as to why is a kind of company specific view on valuations, kind of anything on that? My second question you're clearly having a lot of cash there's been a couple of press articles about the possibility of taking the company private, so we'd be interested in hearing your views around what about you'd be interested in doing or not? Thanks.\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"Yes. I think fundamentally, we are not like -- we are not a core public investor. Yes, I think in the end, we are in the business of building companies and influencing the companies strongly and they've been kind of our influence goes strongly down afterwards. I think then basically it becomes ultimately just a public holding. And I think that is really independent of the performance of the company. It's just not core. I think fundamental core strategy.\", \"With regards the question about the private, I think we never took a decision to take the company private. Yes, obviously, in kind of whatever that 55,000 different capital markets [indiscernible] do every day I think at this point of time, it's not the strategy of the company, can't we take the company private and we don't comment -- having with on all those rumors and so on. I think the rumors all the time and we never comment on them. Currently at this point of time there is no decision to take the company private.\", 'Nikolas Mauder', \"Thank you. It's Nikolas from Kepler Cheuvreux. Two questions, the first one on your decision regarding where to invest, in which vehicle because we know that you closed two sort of massive funds and at the same time there's limited investment at the level of the holding. When you close those funds or market them to the investors, what do you tell them in terms of how many investments you can undertake, while at the same time you tell the capital markets that you do like 89 million in the first half year of 2019. That's the first question.\", \"The second one on the debt growth capital, think about the small change in the number from 0.3 billion to 0.2 billion. If that, was that a repayment or did you have to write off something there, what's happening there in the team, is it going along well? Thank you.\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I will start with the second. That is all fine. There wasn't any white off or something. I think that just goes up and down depending on company [indiscernible] debt. So, that is a good business in the current environment. One see sometimes less and sometimes more opportunity probably currently maybe little less. I think primarily just look forward to use [indiscernible] can put the total bucket of potential cash together.\", 'With regard to the fund, I think 2015 we announced that basically we do certain investments with the fund and we do have as Rocket shareholders, Rocket basically has a carry on that, so basically beyond the [expertise] [ph] that the company invests which is roughly 28% of every investment that it has a carry together with a carry that gets you to maybe 45% or 44% depending on carry structures of the total outcome, if you are above a certain hurdle rate.', \"Again, I think sometimes there are more rumors than reality, I think we recorded about one fund from 2015, 2016 and I think then we made one announcement about the next fund. And I think it's very complementary to our core business and I don't think it's anything to change, but I think everything basically is very much reflected in the second and in the numbers where you have the private company in those numbers. So, I think that it's reflected and basically takes everything account, obviously not to carry because it can only go carry when you actually meet the revenues and not when you may make in the future.\", 'Any other question?', 'Sarah Simon', \"Sarah Simon from Berenberg. This number has a 200 plus, it does include the company you're incubating at the Rocket laboratories just as a third-party investment, I think that's the first question.\", 'And then, the second one was Traveloka, can you confirm if they are doing another funding [around it’s] [ph] payments. And what kind of level of influence do you have in that business?', 'Oliver Samwer', \"So, this one does not include the integrated companies because most of them in incubated companies we have a different, it's not its fair value, but the equity. So, basically it can be a company that we incubated then we basically diluted so much that suddenly changed it to fair value. So, but to say on an average kind of as a general guidelines, this number does not include companies, so you still hold a significant stake in the incubated.\", \"With regards to Traveloka, it's unfortunately every year the same. We cannot comment. I think it's the company that is of significant size that is leading in Southeast Asia in the travel market. And that is run by a wonderful founding team and whoever reports what it's kind of we don't comment on all those rumors.\", \"But, we do have a Board seat in the company. But, is a company that is strongly and I think the best companies out there that is strongly managed by the founding team, CEO Ferry, one of the other co-founders [Henry] [ph], and they -- I encourage if you want to learn about that company, you won't learn a lot through us, so basically talk to your Asian colleagues and I think with all those reporting and so on, I would really wait until the company self report there something. If whenever the company reports, but not to follow too much what blogs and so on say.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', '[indiscernible]. I was wondering, if you could just comment on your thoughts on buyback. Clearly, you did quite a bit last year and the year before. But, I was just wondering what drove the decision, or whether you want to buy back shares or not?', 'Oliver Samwer', \"So, I think over time basically, I do think the company considers to buyback more share. I think a decision has not been made. If a decision will be made, there will be normal ad hoc concern. So, I think historically, we've been a situation that we bought back shares. I think, if you look at the different values, yes, I think it's basically at certain levels, you basically have at the company side kind of doesn't make sense now to buyback more because rather it makes more sense to invest in new young companies. I think historically probably the buyback wasn't an easy answer. I think whatever 25 years of market cap of the company is around 3.8 billion. So, if you look at basically, if you look at to take the cash level and so on, basically that is whatever like 3.6 and as I say kind of it can fluctuate with the public markets to say, with current share price maybe it might be more 3.5, yes.\", \"And then, basically, you have to base on your view on -- on the young companies and -- in this slide here about the private. And then, basically, know you come to the conclusion that you know it's not a must do decision to buyback share. So, I think my statement is, is the company likely to buy back shares over the next five years, yes. Does it have to happen this year or next year, I think it will all depend on market conditions where we will act in the interest of the shareholders, but I think it's not a must do for the company. It's not that it's necessarily a huge valuation gap or something that is a must do decision.\", 'Marcus Diebel', \"Hi, Marcus Diebel, JPMorgan. Maybe following up on the question on cutting down your stakes, the current stakes to your GFG, Home 24 you mentioned, can you give any view on this whole strategic you see this, I appreciate you can't tell us much in detail, but how do you look at them with a long-term core investment to you or do you think over the long run, we'll see a potential reduction here as well.\", \"And then, secondly, you must get a little bit of pressure from shareholders. On the question of whether selling down and impacting the liquidity of the stocks quite significantly because share prices to follow. Is that really in the interest of profit shareholder to sell, and keep the money short-term on the balance sheet? Given what you said, it doesn't sound like there's a lot of investment to come from, what is considered for now. So, how do you justify this strategy?\", \"And then, lastly, in regards to Rocket and other players in the space, I'm Softbank clearly investing a lot in different companies these days. Do you feel that the only way to get assets to repay up and how can Rocket actually compare or compete against these kind of players in the current markets of the negative interest rates?\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"So, we feel Jumia and GFG have still a lot of potential. Remember the end markets where the average penetration of e-commerce is so much lower than in Europe or U.S. or China. So, the markets in Africa obviously, relative terms extremely low penetration rates, but also GFG in Latam, Southeast Asia, Russia. I think it's a lot more growth to come. So, I do expect that the company's ownerships are going to be very high holds in the future.\", \"So, I think it's a very, very fast growth market there. We think adds to balance sheet and cash levels and competition. So, I think let's be very clear, we cannot compete with the Softbank, yes. I think that is a different league. It's a different business model. That is a different game. It's the same as you would suddenly ask whatever, whom you are competing, to the Google or something. That's a different set.\", 'I think if you put things in perspective or something in Europe, itself I think to have €3 billion euros in net cash and to be able to create to support companies like historically [indiscernible] others. I think, you saw I think with a success of deliver yield with the success of the [indiscernible], with the success of [indiscernible], that holds to a few hundred million, your company can make a big difference. And if you look at the size of the fund, that maybe traditionally sees have in Europe, €3 billion net cash plus some part funds to third parties is a significant position.', \"And the honest answer I think is just a wide opportunity where management team is so convinced me to come along. And which [unspans] [ph] the answer, I don't know when it comes along. It can come out of the existing incubate companies, it can come out of -- in basic complementary investment, it can come with a new opportunity and that is also answer with the shareholders. And I think our long-term shareholders feel very confident and don't want us to buyback all the time shares, or to do -- cash to the shareholders or something. But, obviously there might be a group of shareholders that say the company has too much capital.\", \"But, I would say look at the cash course of Apple and Microsoft, it's on their course, who keep a lot of cash still to be ready, if they suddenly have to buy obviously in their sizes different leagues of companies. But, I think we don't want to go back to the market, if you suddenly want to invest again 800 million in one business. And I think this independency of the moods of the capital market, the independent is not the big value. Can't be valued highly that we don't have to go to outside capital.\", \"At the same time, it could happen, let's say, I mean I don't expect it, but five years is a long timeframe. If you look between here and 2025 maybe there will be one day an opportunity, so big that we even go back to the public market. But, I think in general we like the independent, we like the flexibility. We believe in a tech market that will go still for 20 years to come. So, there will be many opportunities and maybe one-day there will be the opportunity -- will be even a situation where capital means something again.\", \"Yes, I mean in today's world, obviously, the value of capital has decreased. But, I think we are in a fast growing market and if something ever changed on macro then kind of the groups that have significant cash reserves might be able to take advantage. But, I agree and I clearly say that to our investors, it's a mid to long-term strategy. So, it might be not the right like the perfect strategy for next few years. Yes, if the strategy builds more long five to 10 years and it's now my 22 years in kind of building Internet companies. Yes, I have an intention to do another 20 years, so I think that's the way we look at this company and that I think while fix the mix and long-term shareholders, but, that might not be perfect for the shareholders that have a two to three year window.\", 'Nikolas Mauder', \"Thank you. Nikolas again. Following up on what we discussed. You said that often you don't have the conviction to make a large investment. Can you maybe named top three reasons, why you don't make investments like over the array of investment opportunities that you've seen over like the recent year. Yes, that would be interesting.\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I think one of the key reasons, the competitive set, so meaning kind of like the level of dominance that we think this company can achieve and that it can out compete the others. I think it's often the reason why we don't feel, I would say then ends with -- it's a can do investment, what amount of must do investment. And I think this is always a very difficult question, but I think we feel, if we deploy a lot of our capital, we need to be a much do investment.\", \"And I think that's what we felt with the [indiscernible] HelloFresh deliver you and others. And I think we have a couple of them where we feel very confident and we already put significant capital in the company called Awaytravel, as you saw in the history of Traveloka, those are companies where we put significant capital with it. To some extent, we couldn't put more, but I think there is some companies have that high level conviction for us. I think we probably don't see enough or we cannot put enough in the ones that you have that high conviction. One of those two, the competition I think is one.\", \"What's the second most frequent reason, I think the next is probably that somehow valuation doesn't get us there that basically come to the company is a must do, but kind of like at this valuation, it feels like really betting that the market's days like today. And so, we ask ourselves about that risk and insert a lot of other things, could be unit economics, could be not complete management team, many other things.\", \"I would say number one is competition. I would think for the white company you are willing to pay up. I think people when we invested, 600 million HelloFresh to build out our shares. People look at it with that device and be to deliver, your people ask us, yes. So, I think we're willing to pay up for the White Company. But, we need to have a very strong conviction that they have -- it might have -- huge market ahead of them that they have a very strong competitive situation. And to believe that they will own a lot of that market and it needs to be at a valuation where we basically have where we can still make a lot of money.\", \"But I tell you, we've had that conviction and we had other co-investors or other people who did have a different conviction, so that they did ask. So, in the end, it's still a very subjective. Yes, and we also have obviously, a lot of companies that have made the wrong decision where basically we were not brave enough or didn't have the same level of conviction as others. And I think it plays in all ways and I think probably, we did not find enough conviction or the few that we have high conviction, we couldn't put enough money. Any other question. Operator can please open up the line to see, if there are any questions on the phone?\", 'Operator', 'Yes, sure. [Operator Instructions] ', 'Oliver Samwer', 'I think --', 'Operator', 'Yes. We received two questions. One is from John King of Bank of America.', 'John King', \"Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a question on, I guess your focus you mentioned the successes of things like Slack relative to Uber, we were obviously trading below that last private round valuations. I mean one thing that obviously as those anecdotes say that software is in some ways outperforms on the Internet, names, and certainly, I think we've seen that in Europe more recently. And so, I guess, wonder whether that's reflected in your portfolio and how you feel about it. You mentioned consumer Internet. Do you feel like going forward, we could see Rocket much more as a kind of start investor than a consumer Internet investor? And I guess do you have the right expertise to make that transition if so.\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I think it's a good question. Yes, that is our goal. I wouldn't say either off meaning not a consumer or B2B or software. I think we also wanted to be a leading software investor. Slack, Jumia a lot of other companies, I think that speaks for itself. I do think we have the team and the competence. And last but not least, therefore, many of them, the customers because many of our company's, customers know for us to build their software company or to strategically invest in other, I think we can give them a lot of access to many of our companies and we have a deep understanding of, if their software performs, so if they have a good product market fit.\", \"So I think that goal in the next 2025 is to be a very strong software investor. I'm always careful with this trend. Yes, I think it will be great consumer companies over the next five years. It would be great software companies, there would be great fintech companies. So, I think you saw in the presentation that would be very horizontally positioned today. And for some expert lead B2B company with many of the leading ducks companies, leading the large German listed companies being clients. It's a very strong growth with a very big market. And it's more of a B2B software community business than it is a consumer tech business.\", \"So I think you want to be both and we would have no issue of putting 100 or 200 or 300 million in the software business or building software businesses and supporting them on their way. So, I think it's valid.\", 'John King', \"Thank you. And another question on your investment outlook, coming -- you've been your -- you had a strong track record in investing obviously in startups and young companies. But, would you consider going forward in investing in perhaps older technology businesses that essentially you think are underneath their fair value and that you could add value to towards. I mean is that only agenda now for you to differentiate branch out into more -- maybe mature businesses.\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I think we do have a situation that the company never had before that we have a significant base of capital that with our knowledge of operational companies that allows us to support opportunistically invest in undervalued companies or mature companies on. I think that we always have a focus on growth, so I do think it's very unlikely that the value trade or that we say this to this company. That's a good bargain to make. I think in our DNA of this company is growth across many sectors. So, I think it's more likely that we will pay up to a company bid in private or public that is delivering strong growth.\", \"I think it's less likely with really mature businesses. So, I think growth is still a very important obviously those can be 20% per year which can also be 50 to 100. I think over all we are not a technology value investor, that's I think not our core DNA, and what we are good at.\", 'John King', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you, very much. [Indiscernible] ', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Yes. Thank you. Just a technical question on your outstanding shares because the difference between issued and outstanding according to your Web site is 1.7 million shares, but you have bought back in total 4.6 million shares in '17 and '18. Just wondering whether that number is updated and correct?\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I think it's correct and I think it has to do with some of those shares have been cancelled and others have not been canceled yet that's a German legal process that's happening. I think you have to generally zoom everything what we bought back, will at some point of time be canceled, a big part is already, the rest will be done at some point of time.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. So, if I take issued and subject 4.6 million shares from that that gives me the number -- the right number should you cancel all bought back shares, is that correct?', 'Oliver Samwer', 'Yes. You should always kind of like kind of assume what we bought back, is canceled and I think this 1.7, let me point out, I think is the uncancelled number. So, basically you should subtract that.', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Does the 1.7, obviously cancelled and the difference to the 4.6 is, is the difference which hasn't been canceled yet I guess.\", 'Oliver Samwer', 'I think my colleague Bettina will sort that in one second.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And do you include the bought back shares which have not been cancelled in your public stock?', 'Bettina Curtze', 'So, the right answer, so for the shares outstanding we have 150.7 million. You find it on the Web site and the issued share capital is 152.5 million.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. But, the difference being…', 'Bettina Curtze', '[Treasury] [ph] shares.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. You bought back 4.6 million shares, it means there is another 3 million which you could cancel potentially?', 'Bettina Curtze', \"Now, some have been canceled.

The other three million shares, are they included in public stock or?', 'Bettina Curtze', 'I mean the others are treasury shares, right. So, the difference between the 152 and 150 million is treasury shares.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. They are not included in your calculation of public stock?', 'Bettina Curtze', 'No.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And they could potentially be cancelled?', 'Oliver Samwer', 'Yes.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Oliver Samwer', \"I would always look at the 150.7 or something, yes, that is the number. If it's cancelled or not it's just a matter of time, it all be cancelled, if they're held today in Treasury.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"But, just to understand -- to make sure, I don't misunderstand. If you cancel the other shares, you will end up at 147.7 million shares, that's what I think…\", 'Oliver Samwer', \"I think we'll end up at 150.7…\", 'Bettina Curtze', \"I think, I'd call you back offline.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay.', 'Bettina Curtze', 'If you cancel all the treasury shares, we will still have 150.7 million shares outstanding.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'So, there is -- we have to check, okay. thanks.', 'Oliver Samwer', \"Okay. I think little ExpertLead to see kind of what kind especially with the B2B forecast. But the kind of young fast growing company as we do that is our future and it's had a mid-term two or three years. It's not the way you have to look at Rocket. We having a mid and long-term strategy based on our past success and based on our confidence that we have in the company. And we will update you whenever we feel that is strongly outperforming company, there is a huge opportunity, there is any change in strategy. But, I don't think there is an expected change of strategy to come in the next five years.

And the common observation, during all of this project was pretty obvious one, which is nearly all companies regardless of how successful they were in or reduced risk of operating didn't have the right experts to the right tech people.\", \"So, basically all big corporate had great ideas on how to digitize, they had very sophisticated IT strategies, very complex IT roadmaps in theory, but they didn't have the right amount of tech talent to actually implement this. And that's where Expertly comes into the game. So, what we do with our tech-ridden community is, we provide the skills and the knowledge of our tech-ridden community to companies and we have companies to realize their digital agendas.\", 'And the special thing about us is that we do not have any kind of [indiscernible] in our community. We really focus on the very best. So, we developed a very complex and sophisticated quality screening process, which allows us to identify on a very objective scale who are good coder, who best coder, and who are very best coders and we only focus on the very best one and in the end we only accept the top 5% of all tech in our community.', \"So, think about our community like a place where there are excellent software developer, data scientists, AI designer, technical product manager, technical product owner, scrum master, so basically all kinds of people you need to realize complex IT project. And our mission at ExpertLead is to enable the world's best tech freelancer to become even better. So as mentioned we gather outstanding talent into our community and we give them the opportunity to get even better. So, the idea is good guys together in one community, learn from each other and get even better. So, we established lots of knowledge exchange mechanism within our community with offline events with online events. We have peer to peer knowledge exchange sessions to really make sure that knowledge gets transferred within the community. And at the same time, also mentioned earlier companies can get access to this highly qualified pool of IT individuals in which the freelancers again further get -- further experience to get better and what they are currently doing.\", \"The very important thing to note upfront what ExpertLead is that we are not another top platform, it's not like people come to us to find a new job or a new project. We are much more of what we are. So, what we are is, the two lines that you see here on the one hand our main focus is to serve this community of IT experts and on the other hand to serve our clients to really find and assess the right techies that they need for their own individual IT project.\", \"So, what does that mean in more detail, starting with the community, so, as you can see on this slide, we have let's say highest dimensions that define our community. So, number one is to peer to peer quality review, so we leverage the knowledge of our community to accept new applicants into the community, so, even if someone wants to enter and say software developer, need to do certain exercises coding, challenges, personality screening and also peer to peer operations with a life coding exercise with someone of the community. So that in the end everyone, who is part of the community is really outstanding in what is doing.\", 'So, other community members have to guarantee, whenever they exchange knowledge or they collaborate with someone within the community, they are actually operating with one of the very best.', \"The second dimension is related to content. So we know that these tech guys they love to coach, but they hate to do attendance, they hate to do customer acquisition, they hate to do invoicing, they hate to do conflict settings, so this is all taken care from ExpertLead side and all community members don't need to have to live with that and can fully focus on coding.\", 'Thirdly, all freelancers in our community only get better customer project that -- nice situation with -- always more companies, who need good freelancers up then, good freelancer that are available, so we can really only select the very best, the most interesting, the most challenging project to all our community member.', \"Fourthly, we have an ecosystem of relevant freelancers, so it's basically everyone who is part of our community get access to let's say freelance and supporting services. For instance, discounts on freelancer insurances, preferred access to freelance the bank account, discount or freelance [indiscernible] and the like. And then, last but not least, we know, freelancers are hard working and we make sure that they always get the payment on time. We don't make any compromises here and we take care of the whole billing and stresses the part that freelancers get paid on time always without compromise.\", \"Looking on the client side, as mentioned we also put lots of emphasis on really helping companies on an individual scope. So, we not only find the right tech people for the companies, but we assess them as well. So, companies who work with our freelancers can only look at the person to fit because they know all the candidates coming from all community have a very high technical fit because they passed a thorough quality screening process upfront. So, companies get on the one hand access to our community. On the second that I mentioned they actually know that everyone is quality tested and belongs to the very best in their respective fields. They get certainly access to our community members in a very fast way. So, normally we're able to match freelancers and companies in less than 48 hours.\", 'Of course, big corporates like to have dedicated counterpart and they find it within our company. And of course, in the end here also we take care of all document parts that the company has a very hassle free process or set up. We do contracting. We do invoicing and companies can just focus on working with this [Technical Difficulty] to deliver their IT complex projects.', \"Why is the full market so interesting for us? You can see on that slide, so there's a significant change in the whole workforce demographics happening, right. So, especially the tech talent is moving into employment into freelancing. Taking a snapshot of the U.S. workforce in 2017 shows that a quarter of the U.S. workforce worked on freelance basis. And it's actually estimated that in eight years, so by 2027, the majority of workforce will comprise of freelancers. And of course, some companies and some markets are always a little bit faster than others.\", \"But, if you look at Google for instance, early adopters of new trends. They already announced last year that they had to more freelancers than full time on the payroll. So, it's not like there's a small group of individuals who are doing freelancing. There's actually a massive change in the whole workforce demographic happening and we want to be the ones that position ourself early enough to be the go to place for freelancers going forward.\", 'So, with ever increasing amount of freelancers and also the increasing complexity of IT, the quality screening becomes very important. And as I mentioned at the beginning, we have developed a process to really identify on an objective and scalable way, who is good, not good and very good. And the top 5% make it into our community. And this quality screening process includes a couple of steps.', 'First step is an experience and competitive screening where we check, do the people in our community can -- communicate, where do they speak the languages that they have on the CV? Are they able to work efficiently in teams and this kind of activity.', 'Second of all, we do coding assignments. So, basically everyone wants to be part of the community needs to do a three-hour homework assignment where we can see on the objective way if the code where written, is it smartly written, is it well-documented, is it efficiently coded? We can test that automatically. And then, this people who pass the gates, come in to the technical appear to peer interview, where people from our community do a life coding exercise with the new applicants. So, in this session, we really evaluate two things, number one is, that this person really do the home assignment on his own or did he got help or did he get some copy paste code snippet and by asking the right questions to find that out easily.', 'And secondly, we assess how someone thinks strategically about codes. So, if someone experienced enough to not only have one coding solution, but if someone able to provide multiple coding solutions to a given project.', 'And then, last but not least, what was part of our community not that we have continued quality assessment, so every freelancer who does a project with a client gets a rating after the project and only the very best ones with the highest ratings are allowed to stay within the community.', \"So, through all these steps, we can really guarantee that we only have the top 5% of the individual applicants in our network. And it's not a marketing slogan, [indiscernible] 3% or 4% of people who pass quarterly.\", \"So, as mentioned earlier, the community is only focused on techs who have software developers and all programming languages and all frameworks. We have data scientists, technical project manager, product owners, drivex designer, and maybe one additional thing, I did mention is the beta that we are currently running at on the vertical of penetration testing private security. So, basically we have very soon freelancer that hack into a company's security mechanisms and find loopholes. And then, of course, in the end talk to the companies and address to fix these reports.\", \"And I think so far, as you can see on this chart is a whole community growth activities have been quite successful. Our community is growing constantly. We are a young company. We started in January 2018, but the community numbers are growing quite fast, 73% quarter-on-quarter, the same on the delivered project volume. So, in total even though we're just operating since one year nine months, we delivered more than €5 million project volume also growing constantly currently with 59% quarter-on-quarter.\", \"And I think at least for me as the Managing Director of this company, yes, growth is of course important, but especially for young companies, it's much more important thing currently is that the customer that we have are very satisfied with our services because these other guys who bring additional customers in the future. And what we can see from the selective customer, this is going to charge is that our quality screening really works. The constant feedback we get is that a lot of freelancers are extremely good in what they're doing and hence our customers are coming back very often as you can see on the top right corner.\", \"We are a young company and projects last between three and six months. So, even though, we're just operating one year nine months customers already come back three times on average. Keeping in mind that many customers are first time customers and the project has been running. We know that these numbers will go up because they never had the chance to get back. Yes. And what we think is really interesting and what we always proud of is that we have a very broad range of customers.\", \"So, it's completely industry and science agnostic because in the end everyone needs good ticket. So, we have corporates, we have SME clients, we have small scale ups, we also start ups, only one thing for start ups. I mean I'm running a startup myself and very often startups do not have the money to afford top 5%. But, if it's the finest startups, also part of our target group. And in the end that's completely industry and science agnostic, everyone who needs good techie can come to us and work with us.\", \"Yes. That this -- so, I think so far it has been a very interesting journey started in general with my friend and co-founder Ana with two guys, now we are around 50, by end of year would be 60 people. We have the feeling, it's super exciting market and I think lots of future growth to come with our team and we are very much looking forward to achieve further growth together with Rocket and also two additional investors that joined our team recently. Yes, I think that's it. Thank you very much. Any questions?\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Can you talk about the competitive landscape because it seems like the company's Honeypot, is that one of what you'd consider to be competition?\", 'Alexander Schlomberg', 'No. Honeypot is focusing on full time employees, right, we are focusing on freelancers. So, freelancers come in on a project basis and the talent pool is completely different. And the choppiest team where the whole workforce demographic is changing to what could have been only on the contingency work space like freelancing project base work space. Honeypot is doing only timers.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'And on the [indiscernible] investment, should we take that as an indication that you plan to go, I mean the customer base is primarily in Germany. Can they be a platform for you to expand internationally?', 'Alexander Schlomberg', \"Definitely, definitely. I mean when we did our [indiscernible] with two new investors, we had two [indiscernible] candidates and both [indiscernible] candidates came to the team. So, one strong growing dispute was all the background in tech and one international global strategist like seek who can help us in the future to realize the global potential that we have, right, because the cool thing about our community is, it is already global, right. Yes. It's just that the customer are mainly in the [indiscernible]. But most of our projects are on a remote basis anyway, right. So, it doesn't really matter when you write the code, if you sit next to each other or if you're on other side of the planet. Hence internationalization for us will become pretty easy because we just need to find new customers in new country. But, we can leverage the same community because the community is already on a global scale.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Maybe following up on this, quite interesting comment, so international, what would you say to your share in terms of like employees, who are, you are referring on the platform coming from across India and China. How do you think this will actually develop because it's my view obviously go far as that. The freelance market is very strong right now, but some there might be thought of very highly qualified people coming into the market in the next 10 years. And then, the demand -- set-ups or other spaces, helicopter, [indiscernible] view.\", 'Alexander Schlomberg', \"Yes. I can't let's say split of community members is mainly Europe, but with the increasing shelf Eastern European for instance, right. Because the number of freelancers will increase, but the need for the policy screening increases with the same rate, right. Yes, there are lots of very talented developers in Asia and in India, but with the increasing amount it gets more, more important to identify a few very good ones, right, that the companies would like to work with. That's what we do day in day out. So, the cool thing with us is, people can get access to Indian developers, but they do not need to screen 40, 50 profiles themselves because we did it for them. The guys who are in our network are on an objective base. Top 5% and companies can direct you start working with them, while at the same time, of course, by taking advantage of much lower daily rates. But, the quality level is the same. So, that's definitely our long-term strategy to increase the Eastern European and let's say low cost countries, who will freelances much more, because the quality is the same, but the daily rates are much cheaper.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Thank you. Great presentation. Liked the idea and I hope you succeed. The questions would be, you focus on the top five i.e., the rock stars, right? To what extent does your business idea rest on the assumption that these guys will remain rock star i.e., coding will not get commoditized in the future. You know with all these platforms, when you can get snippets of code is feasible. I think there was an acquisition in the U.S. where exactly that was done like commoditized code. Will that diminish the value of your platform?', \"And secondly, assuming that it stays like this, how can you be sure that that --rock star, like the Neymar of coding? Yes, will stay on your platform and not hire a team of people actually getting him projects. What's the advantage of outsourcing this to your platform? Thank you.\", 'Alexander Schlomberg', \"Yes. So, starting with the first question. Yes. Code is getting commoditized. It's easier to do let's say building blocks of codes and less and less human interaction required for standard code snippets, right. So, basic things.\", \"The things we work on are very complex things, right. They're all individual software solutions with the corporate. They are not such things as -- I can copy paste certain elements from a different project and reuse everything in my new project. Everything is customized, tailor-made and the more complex, the certain IT project gets, the less you can reuse this building blocks that you mentioned, right.\", \"So, we see, clearly a disadvantage for companies that do not do quality screening, aren't companies that does test matching like for instance, there are lots of other providers, right, that would have quality screening. And they would get a big problem from this commoditized code snippet, also the 95% of the other code people in our community have much higher risk of being obsolete, right because they can't do it. It's very complex things that the top 5% can, right. And if anyone is building the building blocks, it is the top 5% who is building them. So, we don't see any risk of this having an impact on our community.\", \"And the second question, the Neymar of code that you've set, yes, the select coders, why do they like working with us and do not do these activities themselves? First of all, they -- does more than just getting projects from us, right. So, that's the whole idea behind the community right. That's the whole topic about knowledge exchange and being part of the lead community, right.\", \"Getting project is one channel and to be honest everyone in our community doesn't have problems getting projects. So, if they want they can continue with their old client. They can always work on previous projects because the customers love them, right, it has worked. The main motivation to be part of our community, right.\", \"So, yes, they have to -- additional channels to get more choice in the projects, which is cool, which is relevant for this guy. But the bigger the bunch actually comes from being part of the community and learning from others were also excellent to become even better. And I think your example fits perfectly well. So, I think Neymar alone on a soccer pitch doesn't have any value, he need 10 additional player to be successful indeed. Now, community people will find additional players to train together and get even better and be part of this elite networking.\", 'Okay, great. Oh, one more question perhaps.', 'Unidentified Analyst', '[indiscernible]', 'Alexander Schlomberg', \"Exactly. It's all commission based. It's high. I mean in peer segment numbers are confidential. I wouldn't like to share them, but it's very high. So, it's 25% and up depending on the project duration, the project length, the project complexity and the number of people involved.\", 'Alexander Schlomberg', 'Okay. I think we have got no further questions. We are done. Thanks for listening.'], ['Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) Autonomous Research Future of Commerce Symposium Conference Call September 19, 2019  8:05 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Mike Milotich - SVP, Investor Relations', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Craig Maurer - Autonomous Research', 'Craig Maurer', \"Good morning. Hopefully, everybody can find their seats so we can start with today's agenda. I'm Craig Maurer. I run the payments and Fintech team for Autonomous. And we'll just get started. You should have a copy of the agenda, so it should be a great day.\", 'Joining us right now is Mike Milotich, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for Visa. Mike thanks for joining us. ', 'Mike Milotich', 'My pleasure. Good morning. ', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Craig Maurer', \"So far, it's been an interesting year with a lot going on, but I actually wanted to start by asking you something we were discussing a few minutes ago, which is very much in the news right now, which is Visa being such an integral part of global commerce and the global economy.\", \"How does Visa deal with things like sanctions that will cut consumers and businesses off from using their cards potentially, and at the same time, it also drives the need from a government's point of view to build up a local network that might compete with Visa over the long-term?\", 'Mike Milotich', 'Yes, I mean I think the way we always -- in these situations, the most important part is just active engagement and education, making sure that people understand the unintended consequences that can come from these actions. So, we do engage the government here in the U.S. quite a bit to help them understand some of the implications of the actions they take. And in some cases, like most recently in Venezuela, we did get a small exemption, so Mastercard to service certain types of banks there.', \"Even though there are much broader sanctions on the market, there is a little bit of an exception for a component of our business that we were able to make the case to say that's something that is beneficial to both sides, and it's not really in our best interest to cut them off in that way. So, we do our best to engage and educate. And hopefully, the right decisions are made.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'How do the conversations tend to go with the governments on the other side of the sanctions when these things come out?', 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I mean I think it's the same. I mean, in some ways, there's only so much we can do obviously, and then we just do our best to explain and help them where we can.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'Okay. All right. So, moving to the business, considering performance through fiscal third quarter, how is the year shaping up versus the expectations Visa had going into the year?', 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. I mean, as always, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. I mean if I start with the business drivers, payment volume, I would say, largely has been in line with our expectations. There's really 2 noticeable -- or notable exceptions, one is the U.K.\", 'At the start of the year, we did not anticipate or expect how much all the, I guess, back and forth on Brexit has really impacted consumer spending particularly in that market. We are still growing because we continue to displace cash, but that economy has slowed quite a bit. And we have a very strong position there, and so that has impacted our European volumes.', \"And then the other place is the dual-branded cards in China continue to roll off, although that doesn't really have a P&L impact. So I would say ex those 2 things, our growth has been in the low double digits and about as expected.\", \"On the transaction side, I would say the growth has been a little bit stronger. We're growing about -- almost 12% on a year-to-date basis, and that's a little bit better than we expected, and it's really being fueled by two things. Contactless continues to thrive in other parts of the world. We said this past quarter we're now -- outside the U.S.; over 50% of our face-to-face transactions are now contactless.\", \"And on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, that penetration is going up three or four percentage points each quarter. And so that has been a little bit stronger than we expected. And then also Visa Direct has outperformed our expectation, and it's driving a lot of transaction growth.\", \"And then cross-border has been a little weaker than we anticipated at the start of the year, particularly in our second quarter. December and January, in particular, were quite weak. But what you saw in the June quarter is the numbers did bounce back, and so it was a little bit of a blip that we saw. But because of that sort of weaker quarter, I would say it is a little bit weaker than we had expected. So, that's sort of the fundamental drivers of the business.\", \"Some of the other components, I would say we are -- have been more successful in selling a lot of our value-added capabilities to clients. So, as innovation is accelerating and the complexity is increasing, what we're finding is clients are looking to us for more help. And so that's a part of the business that has been better than expected, particularly our Visa consulting and analytics capabilities that more and more of our clients are utilizing, and that's one of the reasons why our other revenue has been growing very fast in addition to the 606 impact.\", \"In terms of other revenue things, I mean, FX -- the FX headwind has been a little stronger; the 606 impact, a little more beneficial, so those two mostly watched. So -- and then client incentives have been lower. So, -- and it's really driven by three things. It's not driven by deal timing, which is sort of typically what you talk about when its incentive's being lower. But in this case, it's really driven by three things. So, one is we've been able to get deals done with a little bit better economics than maybe we had originally anticipated.\", \"The two things, I would say, that are the biggest factors are we use incentives to accomplish other things in the ecosystem to push some of our areas of innovation like contactless or the adoption of Fast Funds for Visa Direct to move the money in real-time. And we use incentives to help align interest and get the ecosystem to move, and we've had to do less of that than we have anticipated and still accomplished what we needed to get done. And so that's been favorable.\", 'And then particularly in this last quarter, what happened that we had new pricing go into effect. In a lot of times when we do that, we will deal back some of that pricing in incentives usually in the short term to sort of bleed in the price change for our clients. And we had to do a lot less of that than we had expected.', \"So, all these things are real savings for the business. So when you put all that together, I would say revenue growth, it's about 11%, excluding 6 -- a little over 11% excluding 606 and on a constant dollar basis year-to-date. And so that's probably about what we would have expected.\", \" On expenses, we've invested maybe a little bit more, but generally, that's in line. And then if you go -- start to go below the line, there's been a couple of things. We have been lowering our interest expense entering into swaps, so swapping out our fixed U.S.-denominated debt into variable non-U.S.-dollar debt where there were much lower rates. And so that's been real savings for the business to help the bottom-line and our tax rate has been a little better.\", 'And so when you get down to EPS, even though FX is about a full point stronger, even with that, our EPS is a little bit higher, the growth is a little better than we had expected. So, a little bit of a mixed bag, but generally in line or a little better than expected at the beginning of the year.', 'Craig Maurer', \"So, if we can dig into a couple of things you just talked about, if you could guess -- or not guess, but try to inform us as best you can as to why you think incentives have been running lower than expected or that generally, that will happen when there's less growth. So, -- but it doesn't seem like there's necessarily less growth. So, how have you been able to get some pricing power back?\", 'Mike Milotich', 'Yes, I mean I think a lot of it has to do with that oftentimes, as I mentioned, to accomplish new things, right, one of the, I guess, great things about the business, but one of the challenges, is we innovate and come up with new products and we rely on a large sort of distribution of partners to bring it to market. And that gives us great scale but also can be frustrating if we want to move faster.', 'And a lot of times, we have used incentives to kind of push people along. And I think, in many cases, what our clients are recognizing and we sort of have been successful in sharing with them that a lot of these things are really in their interest.', \"And so we're having to use a little bit less of incentives to get them to move because they just see that's your business opportunity that's in front of them. And we're also getting some scaled players to help us distribute some of these capabilities in ways that are requiring a little less. So, I mean I would say that's really the biggest difference.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"Got it. So, it sounds like it's -- the general appetite to grow electronic payments globally, that's working in your favor.\", 'Mike Milotich', 'It is. It is.', 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Okay. You talked about China for a second in terms of the weakness related to the co-branded cards rolling off. What's been the environment for single-brand cards? How is that playing toward Visa or some of the other global networks?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I would say the trend is very stable. I mean so what -- the way the dynamic works is when some of these dual-branded cards expire and the issuer elects not to reissue them, then they give the consumer two cards. So, they give them a China UnionPay card to use in China and they give them a Visa card that they can use for cross-border purchases. And typically, what we've seen, I mean, there is some risk when that happens that, if that consumer then shows up at a merchant that does accept China UnionPay, that they may not pull out the Visa card.\", \"But what we've seen, even as our payment volume has been slowing in China throughout the year because of this move away from the dual-branded cards, our outbound cross-border business from China has been healthy and stable. So, if there's sort of a little bit of leakage there in that process on our cross-border business, it's very small because it's not really impacting that part of our business. And ultimately, in China, all our revenue is made in inbound and outbound cross-border business and so that's been promising.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"And I assume with the trade war going on, there's no movement in terms of Visa's application for a holistic network.\", 'Mike Milotich', 'We continue to wait patiently, yes.', 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Okay. Might be waiting a while. So sticking to that part of the world, that's really the hot spot for alternative payment methods in terms of things like Alipay. So, how does Visa interact with those systems? Where -- how are they excluded when those systems are used? I think there's a lot of confusion around how money gets into those systems and is spent elsewhere in the world.\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. So, I mean a lot of times, we'll be the funding mechanism to get -- move funds in and out of wallets all over the world, including here in the U.S. But I would say there's been a big trend in the last several quarters with some of these wallet players where they're really starting to engage with us in ways that they didn't before.\", \"So, whether it's LINE and LINE Pay or Paytm, now Gojek this last quarter, these are all in Asia Pacific, and these are all players that are looking at it and saying, okay, let me start embedding a Visa credential into our -- into my wallet for all my consumers, which does two things. It significantly increases the utility of that wallet for the consumer because now they can use it anywhere Visa is accepted around the world, and it gives that player a revenue model, right? They get -- now they start to have issuer economics, and so that's really favorable for them. And of course, we get expanded issuance.\", \"So that's the way we've started to engage more of these players. And in many instances, these are the companies that maybe a year or two ago, you would have been asking me how they're trying to disintermediate us out of these businesses. But I think -- and we've been saying, we see them as potential partners and that's where it's starting to head as they're looking at working with us to just add more value and drive their business.\", \"The other thing that's happening, like in the -- particularly in the case of Paytm, that they've announced in India, is that they're also going to start opening up their merchants to accept our cards. So, not only getting an issuer revenue model, but also starting to get an acquirer revenue model where, for their merchants now, those merchants may attract more affluent people who may be carrying our cards. They get acquirer economics and we get expanded expectance. So, I would say, if anything, the way things are evolving, it's more working with more and more of these players in ways that are mutually beneficial.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Expanding the discussion to a more global view. Visa Direct is obviously a product that has a lot of applications, especially in places like the gig economy, the contractor economy, but you're also now on Earthport. And how are these two assets going to be put together to enable Visa Direct to connect to any bank account in the world?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. So, the biggest thing, we have incredible reach. Obviously, our debit business around the world, we're the leader in debit, and so that gave us access to roughly half the bank accounts in the world. And we were also doing other creative things. You may remember us talking about like, for example, in Canada where we were using our ATM rail to reach accounts that are Interac-branded debit cards. So, we were using all means possible to access these accounts, but we still had good reach but not total ubiquity, and that's really where Earthport comes in.\", \"So Earthport have 88 connections -- 88 countries have connections directly into the ACH or RTP system. And so -- and just to put that in perspective, the top 50 markets drive over 90% of the volume. So, this gives us very great -- really good coverage of all of the bank accounts. And so essentially, what we're doing, as we've said, by the end of the calendar year, we will have those two platforms integrated. So, through your single connection to Visa, you can send us card instructions or account instructions, and then we will route it accordingly.\", 'And what that allows then our partners to do is through sort of a single provider like us, they can mix and match rails and do card-to-card or card-to-account, account-to-card or account-to-account and in doing so also leverage our capabilities in terms of the reliability, security that you would expect to get from Visa. So, it would still be our service, our brand, our capabilities. We just may deliver the funds over another rail for the last mile.', 'Craig Maurer', \"So, correct me if I'm wrong, but effectively, Visa Direct will connect into the omnibus accounts in these countries and then you'll be able to distribute through that account over the ACH rails in the domestic?\", 'Mike Milotich', 'Correct. Correct.', 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Okay. So speaking of ACH, management recently discussed the need to invest in RTP or real-time payments. How is that going to look for Visa? Meaning, clearly, we've seen acquisitions in the space to acquire technology. It seems like some of the best assets globally have been acquired. So there are still some assets out there like a SIA or something like that. But can Visa effectively organically build this out with the type of speed that would be needed? Or is there going to need to be a technology acquisition?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I mean I think our view is that it's not clear. We don't necessarily think the value is going to be in building the software that helps facilitate these rails. I mean the key thing about real-time payments is it's not a proprietary rail. It tends to be owned by the Central Bank or a consortium of banks. And yes, there are -- have been some acquisitions of the software that helps sort of run transactions over that network, but it's more like a processing asset than ownership of the rail.\", \"And the key in real-time payments is then those are open to everybody. So, even in a place like the U.K., we can access that rail the same as our competitors. We even pay the same price as our competitors because the owner of the rail sets the price. So, in our view, that's not necessarily where the value is going to be. What we're working -- what we want is connectivity to as many of these systems as possible, which we've achieved through Earthport.\", \"And then what are the value-added capabilities you're going to need? Because a lot of these real-time payment rails are somewhat limited, right? They don't work 24/7. They don't have authorization capability. They don't have sort of risk and fraud capabilities. You can't manage disputes on them typically. So, these are the kinds of things that we can bring as a solution to clients and then we would just leverage the rail to move the money.\", \"And that's where things like our acquisition of Verifi that we just closed last week or two weeks ago, that would allow us to offer disputes in more of a rail-agnostic way. Also, the one acquisition we're working on that hasn't closed yet, in terms of Rambus, allow us to tokenize those kind of transactions so that it has more of the enhanced security that someone would expect when they use our network exclusively.\", \"So, that's the way we think that it's going to add value. And if there are some markets where it would be strategically important to do, be more involved in the actual platform, then there are people to partner with or we could look to bring some of our own capabilities to do that.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"You mentioned security, Visa, Mastercard, Amex, the American networks with years of experience doing this; you bring very strong security when you go global. And how do local governments view a Visa network versus a local start-up in terms of concerns around securing transactions? And it would seem like a start-up isn't going to have the data. They're not going to have the connectivity. They're not going to be able to protect the consumer in the same way.\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I think a lot of it, similar to what we were talking about with other aspects of government; it just comes down to education. It's -- for all of us who, I guess, live and breathe the space, sort of we know it, but it is very complicated. And so a lot of it just comes down to helping them understand what are some of the trends in fraud and risk, how are things emerging and getting a lot more sophisticated and then the kinds of tools that we have to combat that and help our clients that they -- someone who's maybe newer or going to be less sophisticated isn't going to be as effective in preventing. And so a lot of it just comes down to educating and explaining. And then hopefully, they make the right decisions to allow us to continue to operate in that market.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"And could data localization rules, like what we're seeing in India, really hurt the ability to do cross-border authentication and keep the security levels that you're typically known for?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. I mean it limits things because what their guideline is, is they want that data completely kept separate, which then means we -- there'd be fraud events that may happen in India that we wouldn't necessarily be able to leverage for our tool that we use everywhere else in the world. But more importantly, the flip side of that, anything we're learning in the other parts of the world, we'll be able to apply it in India.\", \"So, you do lose that scale benefit, whether it could be a delay in terms of certain capabilities making it to that market because it's -- we're going to build in our global platform first and then maybe look to move it in country, maybe not, depends on the ROI.\", \"So, generally speaking, most of our capabilities, we are going to enable there because India is a big market, there's a lot of growth opportunity, but there's no doubt that they will be losing some things as a result of them sort of disconnecting from our global network.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Moving to a different subject. B2B is -- everybody wants to have B2B from the networks to private companies. It's where focus seems to be shifting. You guys have done some interesting partnerships like with Bill.com. You've also worked with companies like Wave, and you're pushing a company like WePay to open up auto. So, first of all, what's the plan of attack over the long-term? Second, what are the -- where do you see the lowest-hanging fruit to create connectivity initially?\", 'Mike Milotich', 'Yes. So, we break it into two pieces. So there\\'s the sort of \"carnival\" component of it, which is about a $20 trillion market in our view. We have about $1 trillion of volume now in this business. And between ourselves, Mastercard, Amex, we think it\\'s about $2 trillion to $3 trillion of that market has been penetrated. So there\\'s still a lot of opportunity.', \"The two areas we're primarily focused on for that is, one, just getting our issuers engaged. It's just been --- in the U.S., we take a little bit for granted that a lot of people have corporate cards and P-Cards, and there are lot of active issuers in there in the space. But outside of the U.S., that's not the case.\", \"And so really, working with our clients to help them understand the capabilities and platforms that we have to sort of better serve small, medium-sized and large businesses with products so that they can get better adoption. It's something that we're really focused on and we're having some success. In some ways, the more everyone talks about it, the more they hear that and start to engage to understand how they can maybe capture that opportunity.\", \"The other piece is in virtual cards. Virtual cards are still relatively new and in their infancy. There's only a couple of segments where they're fairly active, and so there's still a lot of room for expansion. And so that's an area we're really focused on both in terms of working with players, like we've announced partnerships with Wax and Ixaris and Sabre this year, but also on the acceptance side. So, not only finding businesses who want to pay that way, but businesses who are willing to be paid this way and want to be paid this way and making that as seamless as possible.\", \"And so the second piece is the much sort of larger opportunity, the $100 trillion of sort of enterprise AR and AP. And they are -- I guess the way we think about it is there's a lot of experimentation going on. We're trying lots of things. There are lots of new companies trying things, our competitors. And everyone is trying to find the sort of the comprehensive solution. And no one's quite been able to sort of put their finger on it just yet. But we are working with lots of different players.\", \"So, you mentioned some of them, some of the other ones are PayMate, which is a company that has 35,000 businesses that are connected in the network. They started in India, and now they're expanding into other parts of the Middle East and Africa. And we're a partner of theirs. They're automating the process. We're helping with the payment component, which is typically how we look to work with these companies, like the ones you mentioned, like Wave, where they're doing some of the more software piece and we bring our payments expertise to the table.\", \"Also, Billtrust is another one of our important clients and partners in this space. So, they have a new sort of business payments network that has been enabled. And what it really does is help automate on the accounts receivable side and also make it much more seamless to receive virtual card payments. So, as I mentioned earlier, building the acceptance of virtual cards is a big important piece, and Billtrust makes that more seamless for players. And that's a network that just, I think, about a month or two ago that JPMorgan announced that they are joining that network and are going to be leveraging that. So, those are the ways we're trying to find the opportunities.\", 'To answer your question on the low-hanging fruit, I think the one area that we see where we have distinct capabilities to really make a lot of progress is in the cross-border market because we have unique capabilities that allow us to do things in a point-to-point way versus the way it works today, sort of multiple hops in a corresponding banking type of arrangement. And we can bring a lot more security and reliability to that space.', \"And so we tackle that in a few different ways. So, on the sort of high end of the market, so large ticket, large complexity, we have our B2B Connect platform, which is allowing us -- which is sort of a -- it's almost -- it is a new rail, really. So, we're leveraging our settlement capability to settle with financial institutions around the world, but we built a new platform that allows us to move money from one country to another in a direct way so that both parties have maximum transparency on when the money will arrive, exactly what fees were applied and the FX that was used.\", \"And then it can hit -- it's built with distributed ledger, so it can carry very sophisticated data and we can attach very complex documents. So, something like at customs, a form can travel with the payment in a way that really serves that need. And we just launched it commercially a few months ago. It's now active and live in about 60 markets. We hope to have it live in 90 by the end of the calendar year and so we see a lot of opportunity there.\", \"And then we talked about Earthport a little earlier, that is really our solution for the smaller ticket, a little bit less complex payments in cross-border where again, more of a point-to-point solution where it doesn't have to take multiple hops. We can deliver it directly to that local market and into a bank account if it's not going to be on our proprietary rail.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"Because of the simplicity of the transaction versus the historical nature of such a transaction, what type of cost efficiencies can you bring to the end users because you're not involving multiple players?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I mean that's a big part of the benefit. So, the way it works today when it takes multiple hops, not only does that sort of limit visibility and transparency, but it also means there's more sort of mouths being fed along the way. And so there's no doubt that it can be a lot more efficient for businesses, so we are adding a lot more value and we can do it at a better price point.\", \"And that also is true in the remittance space. So, that's not a B2B application, but the same is true in remittance where also we're partnering with a lot of large remittance players, and they can use us to move the money digitally. And even with sort of our premium cross-border economics, it's still going to be less expensive than they're paying in commissions at those physical locations where people may be picking up their cash today. So, yes, we can bring capabilities and do it at a lower cost.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. Maybe if we can switch topics. Secure Remote Commerce or SRC, we've spoken a lot about this. It's becoming a much more visible topic. Mastercard's Investor Day last week, they have a great demo of what that could be. So, talk to us a little bit about what sort of the Goldilocks launch would be for SRC? What would be the ideal? And are the banks willing to make that happen because in my opinion, the buck stops there?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Right. So, SRC will be launching in the coming weeks, so you're going to start to see it on some sites here in the U.S. And it will be -- it won't be a broad launch because now we're sort of getting close to the holidays. So, there will be some merchants who will go live, and you'll be able to start using it. And then once we get through the holiday season and basically into 2020, you'll see a much more broad rollout.\", \"I think the key in the rollout of SRC is we're not going to start from scratch. As Mastercard highlighted in their Investor Day and what we've been saying, both of us have an installed base of sort of Masterpass and Checkout, and we've been working behind the scenes, and I believe Mastercard has also, to be able to sort of flip any of those merchants and users to the new Secure Remote Commerce experience. So, we're not going to start from zero. We are going to be able to sort of convert that installed base that we already have and get them up and running.\", \"And then we do have to engage the two parts of the ecosystem. So, on the acquiring side, they're very receptive. And the big thing, I think, to think about on the acquiring side is there's only really two ways to do e-commerce today that have -- are pretty low friction: one is Card-on-file, which is really only reserved for the very largest merchants, so it's fairly limited in who can use -- utilize that; and then PayPal. And PayPal only uses a couple of acquirers around the world.\", 'So, what Secure Remote Commerce really does is now provide every acquirer in the world a relatively seamless solution to offer their merchant customers to accept e-commerce payments. So, we have good engagement on that side of the ecosystem for the issuers.', \"As you mentioned, yes, we are working with them to pushing enrollment, right? We have solutions that they can put into their app or on their website to help facilitate enrollment into the new solution, and that's a big part of the engagement that we're working on. But in the meantime, we do have the ability, just like we did with Checkout, sort of a central hub that consumers can come in and activate their card if their issuer hasn't engaged with us in that process.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"So, -- look, I guess, this leads to the question of Chase just basically shut down Chase Pay for physical transactions. They're keeping it alive for e-comm. I've personally never seen the mark on the website before. They're clearly the lynchpin in your U.S. operation in terms of size of credit card portfolios. Are they on board?\", 'Mike Milotich', \"I mean I can't speak specifically for Chase. I mean, obviously, they're a large and important client for us. I mean I think that, ultimately, the way we talk to our and communicate with our clients is if they see the benefit, so if it's going to prevent -- have less friction and therefore have higher conversion rates, I mean they are looking to engage their customers and have better spend, that's in their interest also.\", \"So, less fraud, higher authorization, more spend is in their interest also. So, I can't speak to a specific client, but I guess they all understand the benefits, and we expect that over time, we'll have their support.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'Will there be marketing dollars toward this launch?', 'Mike Milotich', 'Absolutely. Absolutely.', 'Craig Maurer', 'Okay. And Amex is also obviously part of this as well and can bring a large consumer presence. So-- ', 'Mike Milotich', 'Correct. Correct.', 'Craig Maurer', \"Okay. We have about 10 minutes left, so I wanted to ask the room if there are any questions that people had for Mike. I think [indiscernible] has a microphone. She's going to bring it over.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Thanks. Just back to what you were mentioning about the credentials for the virtual wallet networks in Asia, could you talk about how the issuer economics comes about for them? Do they require banking licenses initially? Or can they kind of fund it out of their wallets themselves?', 'And then maybe just talk more about how that credentialing process works specifically, maybe if you have to focus online or one of the--', 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. Sure. Yes, so it varies by market, so there's two ways you can do it. One can be more of a co-brand-like relationship where they're not going to be the underlying issuer themselves. They're just going to be sort of the co-brand partner, and they're going to leverage a financial institution for the back end of the compliance component. So, that's one way to do it.\", \"And then in some markets, these entities are already regulated. So in the case of Paytm, they're considered what's called a payments bank in India, which means they can extend credit, but they can do debit and prepaid. And they're already regulated as such. So, in that case, they absolutely can be an issuer of a Visa debit or a prepaid card. So, they don't need to go to have a co-brand partner, if you will. They can actually do it themselves and be the underlying issuer.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'In the middle. Thanks.', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Hey Mike. Can you talk about Japan and the Olympics 2020? So, just anything about your expectations for what you would like to achieve there? And then I don't know whether you're able to reference any other times where big events like Olympics, World Cup, those big sporting events, have been influential as catalyst for payment acceptance and growth\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. This is, I would say, this is really a unique opportunity where you're bringing the combination of one of the world's largest economies that is sort of one of the few holdouts in terms of it's not very electronic.\", 'So, Japan and Germany are usually the two markets that often get highlighted as very large economies where electronic use of payments is relatively low compared to their peer set in terms of economic size. So, this really is a unique opportunity in Japan, and the government is very engaged and motivated to leverage Tokyo 2020 as sort of a catalyst to move their market forward and stimulate the economy.', \"And one of the ways they're looking to do that is by pushing more electronic payments. And so it's a great opportunity for us as not only one of the leaders in that market, but as the official sponsor of the Olympics. It makes us uniquely positioned to work with the government and try to capitalize on this opportunity.\", \"One of the things that has been rolling out very quickly there is contactless. So, they -- the government is really trying to make it a purely contactless games as much as possible, and so that's something that's very beneficial. So, we do see a lot of opportunity coming from this, and it is unique in the sense that in other, FIFA or Olympics, we always set up the village, and you can only pay with Visa there. And we always will use that to demonstrate innovative things and try innovative things. But then when the games are over, the village goes away, and a lot of that is gone.\", \"In Japan, our view is that this is going to be the first event where there's a lasting effect on the market that we are quite excited about what that can mean for our business in Japan post the Olympic Games.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"You talked about contactless earlier and again just now. It seems to me the trend tends to be a catalyzing factor in terms of overall use if open-loop transit -- if open-loop card payments comes to transit, it gets into people's everyday lives. So, we see that happening in New York. Italy is coming. Where else in the world should we be on the lookout for an event something like that to catalyze growth?\", 'Mike Milotich', 'Right, I mean it also launched in Miami recently. So, Miami -- so I would say we are working with all the major transit companies or organizations in the U.S. And people are on obviously different progress, but New York and Miami are the furthest ahead. There are -- we have over 200 transit projects going on around the world, so there is a lot of engagement.', \"I think a lot of governments, just as often the case with our business, not only does it make things sort of more seamless for consumers, but it also creates a lot of efficiency because whether they have people who service the tickets or they have large, I guess, vending machines, if you want to call, where you can get a card or reload a card, so there's a lot of efficiency and so we have a whole team.\", \"Started -- we have a center of excellence in London because Transport for London was one of the first major transit systems to really embrace contactless, and the results have been incredible in terms of, I think, it's more than half of the ridership now is tapping to enter any tube or bus in London. And so we -- from there, we've sort of been to -- built a global expertise for that, and that team is now working with governments and transit authorities around the world to try to get contactless implemented and help them understand the benefits.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'Yes. In the U.K., I mean you had stagnation in terms of cash versus electronic for years before that happened, and then penetration of cash fell by 10 points in the two years following the introduction. So, anywhere you see the introduction could be a big catalyst.', 'Mike Milotich', \"And we see, even in terms of engagement, the people who are using -- tapping the card for transit, we see just increased engagement also in the other parts of their spending. So, it is an important use case that we're driving.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'Okay. Question in the back?', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"Just one more on SRC. I just wonder if you view it as something -- if you're having any conversations with PayPal in terms of potentially integrating or leveraging any of the services or tools that they built since they've been doing that obviously for a long time or if you view it as something that would displace them.\", 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes, I would say, no, we haven't engaged. I mean we're close partners with PayPal. We work with them on many things. I would say this is an area that we haven't worked closely together on. The key is that this is not intended to sort of try to knock PayPal out. I think the -- what I think a lot of people underestimate, I guess, is the amount of e-commerce that's done that isn't Card-on-file and is not PayPal.\", \"So, those are really the two ways, as I mentioned earlier, where you can do relatively frictionless e-commerce. But I think you would be surprised, I mean we never, I guess, disclosed the exact number, but the sheer size of e-commerce that isn't done with those two methods, and so that's really what we're trying to address. We want to make e-commerce as frictionless as possible for everyone.\", \"And then as long as you choose to pay with Visa and that's your preferred way to pay, then whether you use SRC or you use PayPal or you have a Card-on-file or indifferent, right, between those options, but what we want is e-commerce is a huge growing use case and a big part of the kind of secular shift and the benefit we get because cash is often not an option. And so we want to take the friction out of that payment, and that's what SRC is really designed to do. It's not necessarily targeted at PayPal or another player in the space.\", 'Craig Maurer', 'Right here.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Could you talk about the incentives that different stakeholders have transitioning from either debit or credit to Fast ACH?', 'Mike Milotich', \"Yes. So, the big -- the obvious benefit that a lot of merchants will state is it could potentially be lower cost for them, right, which hasn't always been the case, like I think there are some markets in Europe where that's not true. But generally, that's sort of the wide belief is that it could be lower cost for the merchant. The interesting challenge though is what's in it for the consumer, right?\", \"So, oftentimes, the consumer is going to be giving up something, particularly the ability to dispute or charge back the transaction. The way it works today is it's more like a wire. So, once you hit send, the money is gone and you don't have dispute rights.\", \"You also don't necessarily have the same kind of security protections involved. So, the key is what is going to get the consumer to change their behavior. And in many of these markets where it's been, the market has been regulated; there also isn't a lot of economics to create incentives to get people to change their behavior.\", \"So, that's really the dynamics that we see, which is why even though there are -- between 30 and 40 real-time payment systems so far live around the world, there's only a couple of instances where it's had any sort of impact at the point-of-sale and in purchases. It's being much more used for B2B-type applications or P2P applications. And that's because it's -- there isn't a lot of incentive for the consumer to change their behavior.\", \"And also, in many cases, they've been sort of difficult to integrate with and incorporate into flexible solutions that can work in lots of different instances. And so that has limited the impact it's had on sort of consumer-to-business commerce.\", 'Craig Maurer', \"I think with that, we're about out of time. But Mike thanks for joining us today.\", 'Mike Milotich', 'My pleasure.'], ['Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) Autonomous Future of CommerceSymposium Conference Call September 19, 2019  9:50 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Carlo Enrico - President of Latin America and the Caribbean', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Craig Moore - Autonomous Research', 'Craig Moore', \"All right. If everybody can come back to their seats, we can get started. And for those of you along the sides, we do have a few seats upfront if you guys want to come on down. Okay. So, we'll continue. We have Mastercard joining us now, and we're lucky to have Carlo Enrico, President of Latin America and the Caribbean joining us. Thank you.\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Thank you.', 'Craig Moore', \"So, I don't think most people in the room or most people on the webcast have had a chance to meet you or talk to you, so maybe you can tell us a little bit about your background and your current role with the company.\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Sure. So, I grew up in Italy, as you can tell me from my accent, and I moved after graduation to London. Seven years at Goldman Sachs in equity research and investment banking on European financials. Back in Italy for 10 years running retail banks. Can you hear me? Yes. And running two retail banks, and then I joined Mastercard in 2012. I run two geographies in Europe; Central Eastern Europe and Western Europe. And eventually last year, I moved to Miami to run the Latin American and Caribbean business.', 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. So, can you share with us some of the trends you see in Latin America? Latin America can be a little confusing because you have economies like Argentina and then you have economies like Brazil and they're vastly different with different trends.\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Sure, it is. You’re right. So, Latin America goes from Mexico all the way down to Argentina, including Caribbean. And as you said rightfully, it is a combination of very different markets. You have large economies, pretty digital, well developed such as Brazil. You have larger economies such as Mexico, pretty well-known to most of us, but also you have smaller economies which are a little bit more volatile, a little bit more vulnerable which includes Argentina, which includes Venezuela of course, and few other Central American economies.', \"I would say the macro outlook is pretty much as we are now used to, meaning that it's an outlook that is promising. That is typically outperforming the global economy but typically pretty vulnerable and volatile. We see an outlook remaining stable in the foreseeable future, that’s from a macro perspective.\", 'If you go into the payment perspective that I think there are some commonalities across the different markets and the commonalities that relates mostly to the demographics of the population.', \"In Latin America, you have 650 million people living, so it’s around 8%, 9% of the global population with - I think three key features. The first one, it's a very young population, 30% of the people in Latin America are millennials, and secondly they are financially still excluded, you have 50% of the adults in Latin America that don't have a current account. And finally, you have 80% of the people that lives in cities.\", \"So, it's a very highly urbanized population, and around those demographics you understand that the opportunity for us is actually to provide financial inclusion and digital inclusion where our growth opportunities are --.\", 'Craig Moore', \"And maybe you can help us size the opportunity. What's the penetration rate of electronic payments in Latin America? What countries represent the most opportunity versus the least, either based on demographic or other factors?\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Well, I think you can size the opportunity in two ways. One, looking at the card business per se, and the other one looking at the broader payment flows. If you look at the card business today in Latin America, only 24% - let me stop and check, only 24% of the personal consumption expenditure runs on cards, all the rest is cash. The 24% compares with around the 50% for developed markets of Europe.', \"So, the ballpark here is that if, and that's an assumption, but if Latin America will reach the European standards, let's say in five years the opportunity is actually to double the card business.\", 'Another way to look at the business opportunity is to look at the broader payment flows, whether they are B2B, government-to-consumer, or consumer-to-merchant, and the size of that opportunity is $14 trillion. Currently, our volumes are around $0.5 billion. So, probably we are currently seeing 3% of the total pie. So, in summary, I think the opportunity is a pretty large one.', 'Craig Moore', 'Can you talk about, since you brought up, how the governments in Latin America are looking at Mastercard versus say the opportunity to grow a local network like Elo, and clearly there are vastly different priorities for governments across the region.', 'Carlo Enrico', \"So, I'm pretty used to domestic schemes and domestic legacies because of my past European experience, and I don't think in Latin America, you have the focus and you have the, necessarily, the local willingness to grow and build and develop local infrastructure. I see a trend where governments are talking more about financial inclusion, lowering the cost of transactions, therefore creating more competition and opening up to four-party model.\", 'This is very true, for instance, in markets such as Argentina, which recently went in open architecture, interoperable market structure; Chile, where things are changing as we speak; Peru, where interoperability will probably be the case next year; Colombia and Mexico. So, I see the legacies in domestic schemes being more of an exception rather than a major trend.', 'Craig Moore', \"There's been, if you look back over time, Latin America had some significant concentrations and lack of competition in the acquiring, in banking. And now you're seeing, in my opinion, Latin America to be clearly the hotbed for disruption of incumbents globally, and I think people mostly look at Brazil when they think about that. And the regulator there has done a fantastic job making small changes that have driven enormous competitive changes. How has that driven Mastercard’s business? How do you look at those companies as opportunities to further penetrate the region?\", 'Carlo Enrico', \"You’re right. There’s a gradual opening up to competition and gradual opening up of the local infrastructure, legacies, and processors to more global safer and digital solutions. I actually see even the regulators driving a more global agenda. What happened in Europe with PSD2 is somehow happening with a different flavor and different timing, but it's somehow happening in most markets in Latin America.\", \"There's a lot of discussions around open banking. Mexico actually is live with data, not with current account access yet. Brazil is well-known to be working on open banking as well. Brazil has recently embraced GDPR. That's a lot of e-money license and fintech regulation.\", 'So, I do see the regulators really opening up the markets and that affects our business very much. Our role becomes not to be the complement to the domestic legacy, but our role becomes more relevant.', 'We gain domestic relevance, and we start seeing more transactions, switch more transactions, and therefore being able to provide more value-added services to our partners. Brazil is the example that you rightfully so mentioned. Brazil is it a market that, over the past 10 years, opened up from two acquirers to now probably 15 acquirers and 200 sub-acquirers or payment facilitators.', \"As the market opens up, as the market fragments, the name of the game for everyone is making sure you have innovation, security, and consumer-friendly solutions. And this is where I think we can add the most value. Brazil is a reference point in terms of dynamics of the market for half of the region, I would say. I said it before, it's Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia are looking at what happened in Brazil as an industry opportunity to create more competition and expand the pie for the benefit of the whole industry as a whole.\", \"We welcome that. We're actually working hand-in-hand with the governments and the regulators to make it happen in a way that everyone in the ecosystem can benefit. And I think it's a path with no return because with one-fourth of the entire transactions in the region that are digital, I think the opening up of the markets to competition and to the global four party model, it's a way with no return.\", 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. You had mentioned CoDi in Mexico. Brazil has a fairly aggressive agenda on QR code payments. Can you talk about QR code payments? There has been a lot of proliferation in Asia. It doesn't - right now, it's still nations in Latin America, but is that a help? Is that a threat? How should we think about QR code as an account presentment tool, helping or hurting your business?\", 'Carlo Enrico', \"That's a lot of debate across the region about QR. There's not a one model that is successful or established. I think that most players realize that the QR code model in China is not easy to replicate in Latin America for several reasons. And therefore, I think there are some good exploratory initiatives that local players are running as well as we are running to see what really fits the best.\", \"I don't think I would be able as of now to really put a label on QR, is that a threat, is that an opportunity, is it going to be successful or not. I think rightfully so the whole industry goes through the exploratory phase of trying as we know there are some local players such as MercadoLibre, such as Rappi, they are trying their own proprietary solution.\", \"There are some local players such as CoDi that are bringing in a solution on a pretty good ACH actually, which is the Mexican one, but with a support from the regulator. And there are of course, initiatives that are EMV driven such as ours in Mexico - sorry, in Peru and in Venezuela. The way we're going to build that business model around it and the way it's going to shape up for the whole region, I think it's too early to say at this point in time.\", 'What I would say is that the QR code as much as new alternative payment methods are always a very nice good way for the industry to make - to understand the importance of innovation. Usually, QR Apple alternative payment methods, new check-out buttons, are wake up calls for the industry as a whole.', \"And I do see banks reacting. I do see fintech reacting. And I see actually a pretty focused agenda in making sure that all the digital solutions are deploying in a market where digital, as I said before, is not the future, but it's already accounting for one-fourth of the overall transactions.\", 'Craig Moore', \"When investors typically focus on QR, I get the most questions from the consumer side, but I wanted to ask you because there's still a ton of merchant penetration that needs to take place in Latin America and is the QR code a tool to do that when you don't have a lot of hard line infrastructure and it's a little much lower cost to implement?\", 'Carlo Enrico', \"I think it's easy to say that a QR code could be an easy way to build acceptance. You print a QR code on an e-mail, you send it out, you print it out, and you display on your desk. But building an ecosystem where consumers are actually embracing the QR code experience and where actually, consumers are approaching that new payment method in a consumer-friendly way and in a secure way, it's a different thing.\", \"So, what I'm saying is that it's easy to build acceptance but if to read a QR code, you need to have a smart mobile phone, you need to have a current account, and you need to have a new consumer experience that is, by definition, not as good as contactless which is our top priority in the region, I think it's going to be difficult to build the consumer reach that is needed to really create a new trend.\", 'Craig Moore', 'I don’t want to forget to ask and I probably should have led with this, but what’s your view on the macro in Latin America of about the - your view on the economies? Brazil has seen some momentum. They could get additional momentum from pension reform. So, how you’re thinking about Brazil and surrounding economies?', 'Carlo Enrico', 'I think we have seen the region growing in the 1% to 1.5% region this year. I think we should expect somehow similar next year.', 'Craig Moore', 'Yes. GDP.', 'Carlo Enrico', \"GDP I'm talking. Yeah. And I see, as I said before, somehow a little bit of a vulnerable environment because of Argentina, because of Venezuela and because of global developments. I actually see personal consumption expenditure which is a more relevant indicator for us continue to grow at a pretty fast pace, between 7% and 9%, which is the underlying fuel of our business. And they see card penetration to continue to increase.\", \"So, while we do look at the economy of course as a key performance indicator, leading indicator, I think our story in Latin America is more of a penetration. Five years ago, we used to have 18% of card payments on the total PC. We're now at 24%. We expect the whole industry to go beyond 30%and Brazil is already beyond 30% over the coming five years. So a stable, vulnerable environment with somehow a limited impact on our business which is mostly driven by penetration.\", 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. When you think about each region, obviously a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work. So, maybe you can call out some of the unique attributes of each of those economies you had mentioned earlier as focuses for Mastercard and what's different when you approach each one of those?\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'So, I - yes, each country has a different market structure, market readiness, innovation, so I see three main buckets in the region. I see Brazil and Mexico, the large economies, competitive environment, still a tremendous opportunity for growth where we have two major achievements in the bank that we need to leverage in Brazil.', 'We are now market leader by a significant amount and we still have great momentum. In terms of market share gain, very well exposed to the fintech and the digital players that are reshaping the market.', 'And Mexico where the strategy is very much to help the whole industry in getting better value out of the four-party model, switching more transactions and offering more tools to embrace digital which is, of course, changing in Mexico as well and then particularly referring to fraud levels, approval rates that are still top of mind for the whole industry.', 'We are the only international player with a clearing house license, so we are very much advanced in our switching strategy. And, therefore, I think we have a particularly fruitful and constructive engagement with the local banks as we speak. Those are the big markets. And of course, they need dedicated teams, dedicated offices and dedicate to strategies.', 'Then, I see the pockets of the markets that are opening up the competition that I said before. Peru, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, markets that are outpace the growth of the region, markets that I think are going to somehow go through the same journey of Brazil in the coming 5 to 10 years, markets where we are investing a lot and markets where we are - we have been switching in Argentina and Uruguay for instance for quite some time. We started switching ahead of competition in Chile in Q1 this year.', 'Colombia, we are very advanced to competition. We are market leaders and we are doubling down our investments in the market and Peru where as I said before starting from January next year, we expect interoperability. So, those are the markets that we like calling market under transformation because the market structure is changing both from a processing rail and regulatory perspective.', 'And then we have the third buckets of markets which I called the hypomarkets, the hypotension markets, where we have a market share that has a lot of room to grow, markets that are more at an early stage. So, the financial inclusion opportunity is even greater, soft markets that offer superior growth and superior margins and these are all the smaller markets from Uruguay, Paraguay to Ecuador and Central America.', \"Building on that, Latin America offers Mastercard an opportunity to be in offers Mastercard an opportunity to be at - in a lot of these economies at the very early stages when they're deciding how their infrastructure is going to be built, how the market will look. How does Mastercard's ownership of real-time payment assets change that conversation a little bit and change how deep you can go in that relationship with governments banks and so on so forth?\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Some of you or most of you might have participated to our investor community meeting last week. So you know how real-time payments and ACH infrastructure are core to our strategy, and you should know about acquisitions in Europe over the past couple of years. Of course, we now have a new opportunity to engage with governments and regulators in Latin America as much as we have around the world to talk about not only displaying and enable card rails, which is what I was referring about before, so building, switching capabilities and providing more value-added services, but also to engage in the new ACH rails.', 'I think the landscape in Latin America is mixed. You have pretty good ACHs with some real-time payment opportunities, but not necessarily with the value-added services and not necessarily with the ability to expand those rails to consumer payments that typically running only B2B. Vice versa, there are ACH in the region that are more obsolete with a lot of room for upgrade. We are very much focused on building the rails in the region. We made a significant investment in Peru, together with the local ACH. We are running for them the entire infrastructure, the batch, the real-time payment and the proxy or directory business.', \"And that ACH in Peru is designed and architected in a way that can on-board and embrace new countries. So, it's going to become a hub for us in Latin America and it gives us the credibility to talk to governments and regulators not about a forward-looking strategy but about an asset that is up and running and present already in the region.\", 'So, definitely an additional topic for us to discuss with the governments on how we can help them building competitive and global state-of-the-art infrastructures for payments.', 'Craig Moore', 'Is that build out in Peru, when we think about how that drives economics to Mastercard, is that a per transaction-type business, is that a licensing business, or infrastructure maintenance-type revenue model?', 'Carlo Enrico', \"It always depends on the services we provide, and it always depends on the case by case. In Peru, it’s a combination of infrastructure maintenance on a per-transaction basis. While we're building the infrastructure today, we are already working with other banks in the system to build this scheme, so to build the applications which are going to be a new source of revenue and a new source of, let me say, a new competitive tool that we have against competition.\", 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. Building on this discussion of Mastercard’s unique capability, how does Mastercard's value-added services contribute to your win rate of banks in the region and talk about maybe some of the tools that are truly different from what your competitors can offer?\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'As you know, our services, as we call them, are mostly related to three areas of business. The first is cybersecurity and intelligence which is our data and security set of solutions. The second one is related to our advisors or our data and solution selling, consulting and managed services capabilities.', 'And the third one is around loyalty and cardholder benefits. You know how the service strategy is relevant for us. You know how much we have invested on it. You know how much the whole management team is focused globally. If you go back over the past five years and you look at the acquisitions we have made, you see how much we have invested in order to really have a differentiating factor.', 'But more than differentiating factor for me, it’s the value that is perceived by our partners that is critical, and I want to make a couple of examples. Coming from Europe to Latin America, one of the biggest surprise was the size of the digital business, right, one-fourth of the transactions outpacing physical transactions by three times. But also, let me say, the amount of frauds and the approval rates which are which have been disappointed for too long.', \"So the investments we have made in security, in safety, in charge banks are now part of our conversation with our partners and I would say that we are very much recognized for leading this security and say I call it digital security roadmap. Approval rates in Latin America are between 60% and 70%. So you have that 30% of the millennials we said before that see their cards decline 30% to 40% of the times. That's a big issue right. That's a credibility of the of the whole payment industry in e-commerce.\", \"We are now not only recognized to be the best brand in term of approval rate. So very consumer friendly but also we have helped a lot the banks in controlling and decreasing that fraud rates in a very significant way there's more room to improve but definitely these digital security is for us at Mastercard very, very important. Is differentiating versus competition is differentiating versus a domestic schemes that you asked before but more important is top of mind of the CEOs of the banks in Latin American.\", \"Maybe a second example would be at around loyalty and cardholder benefits the region compared to the other regions around the world is doing extremely well. What we're doing with cardholder benefits and the credit in the affluent business especially for travelers that goes from the business lounge to the airports from to earn and burn your points to benefits for travelers and agreements with travel\", 'And agreement with travel agencies that we have I think we have a suite of services that that services that that there is definitely within Mastercard a best practice globally and definitely very much appreciated by all customers.', 'Craig Moore', 'Okay. You had what I would call a landmark deal win and see anything like it about 5, 6 years ago when you signed a 20-year extension with Itaú is clearly the most important issuer in Latin America of credit cards. Can you talk a little bit about how that deal was evolved what they saw on Mastercard that they were willing to decrease the penetration of your competitors and basically give you that market share for a 20-year period?', 'Carlo Enrico', \"So I was not in Latin America when we signed the deal so I cannot give you some insights on the negotiation and the shaping of the deal itself but definitely it’s a deal that we are very proud of. It’s a very important partnership with not only the largest but the most innovative player in Brazil within the traditional banks. I think Itaú was very well placed to drive innovation and to continue to maintain and expand its market share. It’s a acquiring business give them also the opportunity to see the whole ecosystem end to end for — from consumers to merchants and it's playing out extremely well.\", 'As any deal, we have some mutual commitments so we are hugely committed to continue to drive their innovation agenda and they of course have committed for the long-term volumes and business with us.', \"That's all I can say. I would say at this point in time on Itaú but it's one of the contributors, it’s not the only one. It is contributing to our continued market share growth. We have been leading, we're being growing market share in the region for 30 consecutive quarters. Most of this market share gain has been driven by Brazil. Some of them have been driven by Itaú.\", 'I would say a big portion of that has been also driven by the fintech space where we have developed a clear leadership across the board, if you look at all the names, with one in particular which is the largest fintech in the world, actually, by thoughtful consideration, by value, which is Nubank, which is a very well-known success story. So, an additional booster on top of Itaú of our market share gains.', 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. And if we think about those fintechs, you have a company like PagSeguro who's driving penetration of micro merchant space. You have others that are approaching it from the novel software point of view. When you approach those fintechs, we know that Mastercard is an enormous global lead, but how do you protect that? In speaking to some of the fintechs down in Brazil more recently, it seems that your competitor, your main global competitor is getting very aggressive on price to try to take that back, not necessarily on capability or whatnot, but it's clear that they've cut price dramatically to try to get some of those companies back on board.\", 'Carlo Enrico', \"We run competition and we develop relationships as always predominantly on the value we provide. And yes, if we need to be competitive on pricing we do that. But I'm very happy to see that most of the fintechs that we have won we have won them because of our C&I or security services because of our advisors support, because of our ability to bring in AI with Brighterion that we bought a few years back.\", 'That is really driving the agenda in Brazil of all the digital players with new data which is a biometric solution that we bought back a couple of years ago and is - has tremendous demand in Brazil, and not only in Brazil but in Brazil in particular.', \"So, it's always a combination. So far I would say so good because we're winning market share and so far as our margins are holding up pretty well.\", 'Craig Moore', 'If I could return to Itaú for a minute, there was a component of that deal that was secondary that has been hung up in regulatory issues since the day you signed it which was I believe Mastercard was supposed to be doing some work or some network infrastructure for Hipercard which was - which is a network that Itaú owns. Is that delevered to get approved? Is that deal - Is that part of the deal scrapped? Or what are the regulators telling you about that?', 'Carlo Enrico', \"I must admit I am not prepared on the topic, not that I don't want to answer, but I have to look into it and I’ll come back.\", 'Craig Moore', \"Okay. Fair enough. I wanted to poll the room for questions. We have about 10 minutes left. Okay. I'm certainly capable of continuing. Wanted to move north back to Mexico. Mexico has been a bit of a conundrum for a long time. It was a closed market, highly antiquated infrastructure and the two processors that are there. How do you see that market evolving? How quickly can that market open up to switching by the major networks?\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Our expectation was by now to be already up and around with whole infrastructure admittedly. So, I agree with you. It has been a longer journey than we expected. But going back again to the frauds and approval rates to share a little bit of my personal experience in my recent visits to the market, this, let me call it a desperate need from the local banks to start switching and to start getting the value of the solutions that you get from a four-party model, Mastercard in this case.', 'And that’s why we got a lot of support from the local banks as much with the Central Bank to become a clearing house which is a necessary step to get into switching and switching turn being a necessary step to deliver our AI data and solutions.', 'So, I really believe that we are at the point where the agenda can accelerate. We are deploying the bits and pieces of technology that is needed to really bring our switching at scale. We already switched 1% of the transaction. It’s not a lot, but we do switch. So, we have in the bag already the proof that the infrastructure works and is well integrated with a very complicated domestic legacy.', \"I do think that in the coming two years, we're going to be ready to switch and we're going to be switching at scale in Mexico.\", 'Craig Moore', 'How does the government in Mexico view Mastercard and the other well-established global networks as a way to fight fraud there, fight gray market economy, a way to generate tax receipts? I mean, this has always been a big talking point, but Mexico continues to be a bit of a mess from that standpoint.', 'Carlo Enrico', 'I know. It’s a complicated environment. I think the government launching CoDi is a good example of how committed they are. They are committed to financial inclusion. They are committed to help growing the industry.', \"The fact that they gave us a Clearing House license and they are very supportive of our agenda is another demonstration that there is really the willingness to go after the huge potential that Mexico has which is huge. It's much greater than any other Latin American market.\", \"We all know the government regulators ourselves that the journey is, by definition, more complicated than in other markets because you don't need to build from scratch, but you need to work at the margin of a very complicated set of legacies. But it's the cooperation and the willingness to go after the opportunities is really great. Probably another example is the cooperation we have with the government on the government disbursement.\", 'At the beginning of this year in January, we launched with BANSEFI, which is a government-owned bank, the largest disbursement program we have globally which is basically the [AMLO] administration launching a disbursement program for more than 20 million Mexicans for more than $20 billion of annual disbursements and this is another strong evidence of the commitment to go after financial inclusion and reach more consumers.', 'As always, what we do is we accommodate the local government and we try to work hand in hand bringing our solutions. Most of the Mexicans receiving disbursements for instance have our biometrics built onboard of the cards. So you have a proof of identity and a proof of life so that all the disbursements are made to the right people at the right time.', 'Craig Moore', \"Is that a product that Brazil is looking at from you guys as they move through pension reform considering there's - if I remember correctly, 5 million Brazilians who receive pension benefits fraudulently by claiming they're farmers and whatnot?\", 'Carlo Enrico', \"That's a global issue by the way I used to run the post-office in Italy before and I used to pay out the pensions. So I can tell you that even in Europe that is still a challenge. Yes, the opportunity is definitely to move into the use our biometrics, our AI to provide more identification services.\", \"You know that we launched two years ago a facial recognition. You know that we had fingerprint built on cards for a long time. It's now live still in Mexico as I said before among other market. As always, we have a - let me say the challenge is to find the right balance between the cost and the scale.\", \"The cost of having a biometric card today is still too high therefore we need to expand as much as we can in order to collapse the cost for more issuers to avoid the technology. But I would say the short answer is no, we're not in discussions to have a biometrics built on the card in Brazil for the pension reform.\", 'But absolutely, we do see a big opportunity in providing more and more technology that goes beyond payments that is not necessarily related to a card payment or a real-time payment to provide identity services. We launched in Australia and we have some preliminary talks in several Latin American markets.', 'Our new digital ID which is a distributed technology to basically provide your own personal data. Those data that you want to share to counterparts that you want to share with, and definitely give in the fraud environment giving the lack of domestic infrastructures and giving the high demand for more security on e-commerce in general, definitely biometrics AI and the digital AD are three key assets that we want to exploit, not necessarily only related to payment.', 'Craig Moore', 'I want to check one more time if there are any questions? Okay. I wanted to ask you to look into your crystal ball for the region, and if you look out over the next five years, if you were to give us the three biggest things that we should keep an eye out for that you think are going to drive real change in the region, what would those be?', 'Carlo Enrico', \"They would be probably, I would say, digital and regulation. Digital has been the biggest surprise for me, European lending in Latin America. There's a huge demand, that's a lot of work to be done at check level, security, fraud level across the chain. In digital, you have this combination of fintechs.\", 'Some of them fintechs are from Latin America are expanding across the region while on prepaid cards mostly from Colombia, new bank from Brazil and so on and so on. There are many. But also on our global fintechs coming, the N26 that I allotted [indiscernible].', \"And there's a - I think we are at an inflection point in the amount of money that is flowing through private equity and venture capital into the fintech space. I do remember three years ago many players saying Latin America is still an emerging market. We still need to plumb the basic rails. Well, if you look at what happened over the past 12 months, the listing of MercadoLibre, PayPal investing $750 million in MercadoLibre; Softbank launching at fintech fund for $5 billion; three unicorns developing - the size of new bank that is now well-known to everyone.\", \"So, what is happening in the digital space is a profound change for the region at the pace that I haven't seen in my previous European experience. So, that's definitely something to pay a lot of attention to.\", 'And the second major trend I think is going to be regulation and I see three main buckets of regulation. You have the global regulation as I said before, the open banking, the real-time payment, the GDPR, let me say the PSD2 kind of regulation that is going to - that has hit already Brazil and Mexico and will be expanding across the region, net-net for us is a positive.', \"So, we like it and we are ready for it. We've been through regulation in Australia, Europe and U.S. So, we have a lot of not only thoughtful leadership but also a lot of solutions that are designed to go after that APIs for open banking to make an example.\", \"Then, you have a second, let me say, trend of regulation that is more the nationalistic that you referred to before whether it's CoDi, whether it's silo, whether it's some natural perfective initiative such as Venezuela these days which I see lighter and lighter over time, but are still there. So, we need to cope with them.\", 'And then I see the regulation that is opening up to competition, facilitating the proliferation of the acquirers, somehow replicating the Brazilian journey, somehow opening the Peru, Argentina, Chile and Colombia, Mexico on this world and therefore providing great opportunities for us.', 'So, I think digital and regulation are definitely the two key trends to keep in mind for the coming five years.', 'Craig Moore', \"With that, I'll say thank you. And we'll start again in roughly five minutes. Thank you.\", 'Carlo Enrico', 'Thank you very much.', 'Question-and-Answer Session'], ['', '\\n        To ensure this doesn’t happen in the future, please enable Javascript and cookies in your browser.\\n        Is this happening to you frequently?

Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our call. As mentioned, I'm joined by Jacque, our CFO and Luctor, Chief Operating Officer. As we noted in our earlier preliminary announcement, we hope that the participants will have had a chance to listen to the replay of our morning's webcast where we've provided full commentary on the preliminary results. I will go through a short summary of the highlights before I take questions together with Jacque and Luctor.\", 'Looking briefly at our production highlights for the full year 2019, firstly and most importantly, we have again reported a continued improvement in our safety performance. Our lost time injury frequency rate improved to 0.21 down from 0.23 in financial year 2018. Our full year production of 3.87 million carats was in line with our guidance, with higher than expected production at Cullinan and Williamson offset by lower production at Finsch.', \"Our run-of-mine production increased to 3.8 million carats which represented 97% of the Group's overall production profile with a 40% reduction in lower value tailings and other diamonds.\", 'Turning now to our financial results for the full year, we have reported revenue down 6% to $463.6 million due to our realized prices being down around 5% in line with the wider market. As some of you may have noted, the diamond market environment has been and remains challenging driven by a weakening in global markets, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, higher than normal polished inventories and the sustained tightening of liquidity in the midstream, further compounded by ongoing disruption in the important market of Hong Kong.', 'This pressure on pricing resulted in our adjusted EBITDA being down 22% to $153 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33% as compared to 39% last year. Our on-mine cash costs were largely in line with expectations and we are continuing to reset the cost base across the portfolio. Operational CapEx was down significantly to $81.4 million as compared to $129.6 million last year, reflecting the effect of completion of our major capital expansion program.', 'So despite the difficult pricing environment, we were able to mitigate this to a certain extent by retaining a tight grip on the factors within our control being production costs and CapEx. This led to an important milestone for us in financial year 2019 through the generation of $70.5 million of operational free cash flow. This is a notable turning point for Petra and reflects both the positive benefit of our capital investment and the transition to steady state operational performance.', 'In terms of future investment, we have maintained our CapEx guidance of around $43 million for financial year 2020 and between $45 million and $55 million for financial year 2021 and between $60 million and $70 million for financial year 2022. Around $30 million per annum relates to staining CapEx across those two years and the balance may need to underground development at Cullinan and Finsch. A significant portion of our financial year 2021 and 2022 CapEx is therefore discretionary and can be curtailed should current market conditions worsen.', \"Further to review of our Life of Mine plans carried out in financial year 2019, we completed impairment reviews on all of the assets in the portfolio. The changes to the underlying operational plans, costs, and capital expenditure assumptions, did not materially change the valuation of these efforts compared to earlier reviews of this nature, and didn't indicate any impairment on a stand-alone basis.\", 'However, the revised stocking price assumptions given recent weakness in the diamond market and a decision to use a slightly lower real price escalator compared to earlier assumptions, resulted in each of the four operational assets carrying values being partially impaired to reflect the latest assessment of the recoverable value. An asset level non-cash impairment charge of $223.7 million has therefore been recognized in the financial results.', \"My priority at Petra has been to assess the business' capacity to deliver free cash flow and as a result of this exercise we launched Project 2022 in July of this year. We have established an internal project team to identify and drive efficiencies to enable us to deliver an initial target of $150 million to $200 million of net free cash flow over a three-year period from this year financial year 2019 to financial year 2022 with delivery weighted towards financial year 2021 and 2022 and dependent on diamond pricing.\", 'Through Project 2022 we will identify and drive efficiencies and improvements across all aspects of the business. The areas in focus include throughput at all operations which we expect will contribute 75% of the target, cost efficiencies expected to contribute 10% of the target, strategic sourcing 5% and other initiatives 10%, which would include sale of equipment and resolution of the blocked parcel and progress around VAT receivables in Tanzania.', 'The diagnostic phase has been completed at both Finsch and Cullinan and has identified and confirmed a number of potential operational cost saving and throughput enhancement opportunities with implementation starting now. In addition, further diagnostics are being conducted to identify opportunities at Koffiefontein and Williamson, as well as those relating to off mine expenditures.', 'Looking at our current sales, we have made a good start at current trading we have made a good start to the year in terms of production with around 705,000 carats produced in July and August which are seasonally stronger months for output. The strong start supports our production target of around 3.8 million carats for financial year 2020.', 'Our first sales of financial year 2020 have delivered revenue of $61.6 million with prices down around 4% on a like-for-like basis when compared with quarter four financial year 2019. While demand remains solid across all assortments, it was weaker for larger white stones. So the market remains challenged in the short term, but we are seeing some mitigation in areas relating to restriction of supply to the market by the major producers, by both production cuts and the deferral of sales. Significant marketing spend by the Diamond Producers Association, as well as De Beers and in the ramp up to Christmas and the fact that we are entering a seasonally stronger retail season.', 'We also believe that the long-term outlook for our market remains positive given the forecast tightening of supply due to the closure of all the mines including the Argyle mine, which last year produced around 14 million carats out of a total of 148 million carats globally. Petra will also continue to work to stimulate consumer demand via its contribution to the Diamond Producers Association which focuses on generic marketing in the core markets of the U.S., China, India, and to a limited extent in Europe.', \"In conclusion, I again highlight Petra's solid operational performance in financial year 2019 and also reaching the important milestone in generating $70.5 million of operational free cash flows, despite a weaker market and during the company's transition from its expansionary capital base towards the safe production. We are firmly focused on the execution of project 2022 which is expected to reduce our debt levels in the challenging diamond market.\", 'We continue to believe that the long-term fundamentals for the diamond market remained strong. By addressing our leverage in the short-term we will be able to capture future organic growth opportunities and reposition Petra as the leading mid tier diamond producer.', 'That concludes my presentation. and we would now be happy to take any questions you might have. Thank you.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', \"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] As there are no questions, I'll hand it back to Richard for his closing comments.\", 'Richard Duffy', 'Thank you very much.

On the call today, we have Mikhail Zhukov, our Chief Executive Officer; Grigorii Moiseev, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dmitry Sergienkov, our Chief Strategy Officer.', 'The press release and supplementary slides containing our second quarter and first half 2019 results were issued earlier today and a copy may be obtained through our website at investor. hh.ru.', 'Now, I will quickly walk you through the Safe Harbor statements. Today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by such statements and forward-looking statements made today, speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.', 'For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section in our final prospectus in connection with our initial public offering and filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2019.', 'During this call, we will be referring to some non-IFRS financial measures.

A reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures into the most directly comparable IFRS measures is provided in the earnings release we issued today and the slide presentation, each of which is available on our website at investor.hh.ru.', 'Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mikhail to make a quick opening remark. Please go ahead.', 'Mikhail Zhukov', 'Thank you, Roman. Hello to everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings call. We are pleased to announce another strong set of operational and financial results in the second quarter of 2019 despite the ongoing economic slowdown in Russia. In such environment, we have sustained growth of our client base, showed considerable revenue expansion, and boosted profitability, which makes us confident in our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy.', 'Our recent brand awareness strategy demonstrated very satisfying results. We are now the number one online recruiting platform, not only for white, but also for blue collar candidates and the gap between us and the nearest competitor continues to widen. On the back of investment in brand and product development, we achieved two important milestones in this quarter: 40 million CVs in the HeadHunter database and 20 million mobile application downloads. In this context, we are very excited to reiterate our growth and profitability guidance and will strive to live up to market expectation in future.', 'Now, let me turn it to Dmitry to walk you through the key highlights of the second quarter.', 'Dmitry Sergienkov', 'Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on the call. Overall, as Mikhail mentioned, we continued delivering strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter 2019. Our revenue grew by approximately 26% year-on-year, primarily driven by continued Small and Medium Accounts expansion and monetization enhancement of key accounts in Moscow and St. Petersburg. This has led to a 28% revenue growth in the first half of 2019.', 'As noted last time, revenue growth in the second quarter was lower than in the first quarter 2019 due in part to calendar effect. the second quarter of 2019 contains fewer working days and also we saw somewhat lower than usual customer activity in the working days between May holidays, which might be related to the convenient adjacencies of the weekends and overall propensity for the workforce to take additional days off. So obviously, we believe this affected our revenue recognition in May.', 'Our adjusted EBITDA reached 989 million in the second quarter of 2019, representing a 52% margin compared to 48% in the second quarter of 2018. This substantial margin expansion was mainly driven by the operating leverage effect on the back of our revenue expansion. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2019 was RUB1.76 billion, representing 49% margin compared to 42% in the first half of 2018. Capitalizing our asset-light business model, we continue to drive high cash flow conversions in Q2. And as a result, our CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, was less than 6%.', 'Turning the page, we’re also continuing to deliver on the key pillars of our long-term growth strategy in Q2. We continued penetrating untapped market segments with high potential such as small and medium businesses in regions of Russia. Our total estimated customer base increased by 38% year-on-year, and our total customer base in the Russia regions increased by 62%, of which key accounts in Russia region increased by 20% year-on-year and small and medium businesses in the Russia regions increased by 65%.', 'Following an effective price increase since beginning of the year and increase in usage of our services key accounts ARPC in Moscow and St. Petersburg increased by 17% year-on-year accelerating from 2018, 2017 full-year dynamics. Also, small and medium business ARPC in Moscow and St. Petersburg grew by 2%.', 'As Mikhail already said, recently, we conducted an annual brand awareness survey and we like to share some results with you on Page 5. We always say being on top of mind for candidate job search makes a big difference in our double-sided business model. It’s the main source of free, high quality traffic, and which defines [indiscernible] platform efficiency in the end. It also drives inbound flows of new customers predominantly in small and medium category.', 'So, we are very pleased with the survey results received this year. Our total top of mind brand awareness increased by 10% from 45% to 55% making the gap with the closest competitor close to 3 times. It shouldn’t surprise that in white collar space, we’re leading the growth by a big margin, and that continued expanding this year. What we’re most excited about is the result in blue collar segment, which is an emerging and arguably the most competitive area.', 'And for the first time in our history, we’ve become the most recognized brand in Russia, and in this segment as well, where top of mind brand awareness grew by 9% to 42%. This speaks of our ability to transform HeadHunter business towards our strategic goal of being truly universal platform for all types of candidates and employers.', 'Turning to Page 6, in terms of product portfolio, our key product dynamic is generally consistent with what we saw in Q1. So, we maintain comfortable share of subscription revenue in our portfolio of approximately 52%. Job postings is by far the highest growing category driven by first and foremost our expansion into Small and Medium Accounts as well as by additional monetization of Key Accounts.', 'As I mentioned before, subscription prices do not always link to the actual consumption, especially when it comes to large clients. Whereas in job posting areas, this relationship is stronger and more direct making it easier for our sales force to upsell existing clients. You can see it from the nice listing fee dynamics in Q2.', 'It would require some time monetization changes before we have potential to enjoy the same effects from subscription for the upsell, and that’s definitely our mid-term objective.', 'And now here is Grigorii to talk to you about our financial performance.', 'Grigorii Moiseev', 'Yes. Thank you, Dmitry, and hello, everyone. As we mentioned earlier, our consolidated revenue increased by circa 26% year-on-year in the second quarter reaching approximately RUB1.9 billion and 28% year-on-year in the first half of the year reaching approximately RUB3.6 billion.', 'If we flip to Slide number 7, you can see that we have managed to sustain high revenue growth rates both in our key accounts and the Small and Medium Accounts segments. Specifically, our key account revenue increased by 17% in the second quarter and 19% in the first half of 2019 year-on-year. The growth in the segment in the second quarter was mainly attributable to a 17% increase in average revenue per customer in Moscow and St. Petersburg. This was driven by increase in prices and reducing discounts and actually as well by the increase in usage of job postings, meaning the number of postings per customer in this category.', 'Now, our Small and Medium Accounts revenue increased by 31% in the second quarter and 34% in the first half of the year. Again, primarily, as probably at last quarter and actual 2018 primarily due to the growth in the number of these paying Small and Medium accounts, and specifically by a 65% in the second quarter in other regions of Russia.', 'If we flip a page in terms of geography breakdown, we are also – we are making a very good progress, expanding in Russian regions and our customer base in central cities continues to grow as well. Revenue from regional customers increased by 46% in the second quarter and by 51% in the first half of the year, meaning that the pace of increase of revenue in this regional customers’ is actually the same as it was in 2018.', 'This increase was mostly driven by the growth in number of regional Small and Medium accounts. And we consider this dynamics to be good reflection of our strategic focus to further penetrate into the regional customer segment, specifically, Small and Medium accounts. Revenue in Moscow and St. Petersburg increased by 17% in the second quarter and 19% in the first half of the year. And as Dmitry mentioned already, that was mostly driven by increase in amortization of key accounts in Moscow and St. Petersburg.', 'We skip the next slide, Number 9 as it was covered before. Moving onto Number 10. Let me give you some more detail on our expenses and margins. Here on this slide I will comment on the first half of the year numbers, which are at the bottom of this slide, because I think there are more meaningful as the spikes of actual particular quarters are balanced out.', 'But you can do your own calculations of course for the Q2 as we – from data we’ve provided in our press release. So in the first half of 2019, our total operating expenses has increased from circa RUB1.7 billion to RUB2 billion or by 21%. And they decreased as a percentage of revenue from 61.4% to 57.7% by circa 4 percentage points.', 'Now, excluding items that are adjustable on the EBITDA levels, such as share-based compensation and IPO related expenses. Our total OpEx in the first half of the year has decreased as a percentage of revenue by 7% to 51% contributing to the EBITDA expansion. If we start from the personnel expenses, they have increased by RUB219 million, as you can see from the chart at the bottom or by 26% in the first half of the year. And they reflect as percentage of revenue to approximately 30%.', 'Actual excluding the share-based compensation personnel expenses increased by 22% and they went down as a percentage of revenue by circa 1.4 percentage points to 28%. The key drivers of growth in personnel expenses, excluding share-based compensation were 92% new people, we have hired over the last 12 months, primarily in our development and production teams in Russia and also the indexation of wages effective from the first quarter of 2019.', 'Now moving onto market and expense. As you can see, they remained roughly flat in ruble terms, both in second – in first half of the year and Q2. And in the first half of the year, they declined as a percentage of revenue by 4% point to 13.4%, which is a bit optical as marketing was very high as percentage of revenue in the first half of 2018. But we still expect marketing to go down as percentage of revenue for the full year, not that significant, but probably by 1 percentage point compared to the 2018.', 'And other costs are mostly represented by professional services, subcontractor costs, office rent and maintenance expenses as well as professional services. You can say that professional services really surged this quarter by RUB145 million more than a 100% on the back of increased IPO-related expenses. And excluding the IPO-related expenses, other costs were flat in ruble terms and declined as percentage of revenue by circa 3 percentage points.', 'And the approximately half of that decrease is attributable to implementation of the new standard of accounting for leases, IFRS 16 and the other half is the operating leverage from the back of increasing revenue. So in conclusion, you can see that all our key expense buckets, excluding the adjustable items have declined as percentage of revenue in this quarter, contributing to the expansion of margin.', 'If we flip a page, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA has reached to RUB989 million for the second quarter of 2019 and RUB1.7 billion in the first half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 52% in the Q2 and as compared to 48% in the Q2 of 2018. In the first half of the year, adjusted EBITDA margin was 49% as compared to 42% in the first half of 2018.', 'Now moving on to CapEx. Our CapEx in the second quarter of 2019 was RUB107 million, an increase over RUB16 million year-on-year. That was primarily due to RUB37 million of office renovation cost, as we are planning to redesign our office of Moscow in 2019 and have allocated the budget of a circa RUB220 million to RUB250 million for this purpose. In this year, it’s worth mentioning that CapEx adjusted for this investment in office renovation in the second quarter is lower than CapEx in the second quarter of 2018.', 'Net Working Capital as of June 30, 2019 remained flat as compared to the end of year 2018, because the increase in trade payables related to IPO expenses was offset by the increase of the advances we have waived for the services we will receive in the second call of the year.', 'Income tax expense was RUB175 million in the second quarter 2019 compared to RUB89 million in the second quarter of 2018. And the key growth driver here was the release of the deferred tax liability last year, which we did not accrue this year. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was 38.8%. That was affected by the IPO-expenses, which are mostly non-deductible on the operational level. If we exclude these expenses, effective tax rate would have been 29.5% as for the second quarter as compared to 33% in 2018.', 'Turn into cash generation metrics on the next slide. In the first half of 2019, we generated circa RUB1 billion from operating activities compared to RUB618 million in 2018 and the growth was primarily driven by the increase in sales. net cash used in investing activities was RUB361 million in the first half of 2019 and the key strength here was the prepayment for acquisition of 25% ownership interest in Skilaz, the Russian HR IT company.', 'net cash used in financing activities was RUB666 million in the first half of 2019 and the change between the periods was primarily due to operating loan repayment of RUB270 million to the associate for loan controlling shareholder. our net debt has decreased from circa RUB3.5 billion to RUB3.2 billion and our leverage has declined from 1.3 times EBITDA to less than one, mostly due to adjusted EBITDA expansion.', 'And finally turning into our guidance, we feel very confident to reiterate the outlook for 2019 for revenue growth in the range of 27% to 30% and the adjusted EBITDA margin in the range from 48% to 50%.', 'That concludes our presentation on our side, and we are opening the floor for your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vyacheslav Degtyarev of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Vyacheslav Degtyarev', 'Yes. thank you very much for the presentation and the questions. So firstly, to the extent possible, can you comment on the pricing strategy for the next year? Do you aim to move to the consumption-based pricing, and maybe there is any early feedback from your key accounts with regard to the strategy if you aim to pursue that. And secondly, can you comment on the seasonality of the cost allocation between Q3 and Q4, particularly marketing and personnel expenses should we see high margins in Q3 or in Q4 of this year? Thank you.', 'Dmitry Sergienkov', 'Yes. Thanks, Vyacheslav. I’ll take the first one on the monetization. I’ll say our biggest theme in monetization is, as you know, aligning value to price and linking to the actual consumption to price. And as you rightly said, we target first of all our big clients and we believe that they consume our services at the very old price there as a value unit. And for that, we have developed a number of initiatives that we are planning to explore in the coming years. We can’t adopt too many changes from a client at a time. Otherwise, we need to push their budgeting growth into trouble. So, we must be careful.', 'And in Q3, we sort of usually start talking to our clients about the next year prices and the process usually is very iterative. So, based on client feedbacks, we can – we normally modify our plans. And so, I don’t think we can disclose at this point of time any detailed pricing and tariff updates. I can only tell you that you should not probably expect any extreme jumps in prices driven by certain initiatives to kick off. As we – generally, we aim for gradual and sustainable monetization strategy. So even crucial changes, like you mentioned, CV database access limits would be implemented in a very smooth and smart way that allows us to sustain high customer growth and contain churn. So on – in particular on CV database access, we will move towards linking consumption of candidate information to price. As you can imagine, for some of our clients, this will – would result in substantial paycheck growth, and therefore it would require some transition period. Next year, we are planning to start running certain experiments with new monetization model for CV database access. But as I said, for the full blown integration, it would require some time and very neat execution to make it smooth.', 'Grigorii Moiseev', \"Hi, Slava, this is Grigorii. On the cost side, for marketing, we expect more expenses in the second half of the year as a percentage of revenue than in the first half of the years. So, we should expect, probably around 14% of marketing as a percentage of revenue for the full year results. And in the personnel, it's actually vice versa. We expect that in the second half of the year, personnel costs will be lower as a percentage revenue than in the first half because of several one-offs we had in Q2. Speaking of the full year results, I guess, you can look at maybe 1% or 1.5% decline, I mean percentage points decline as a percentage of revenue for the full year for the personnel expenses\", 'Vyacheslav Degtyarev', \"That's clear. Thank you very much, but maybe you can somehow comment with regard to the cost allocation between Q3 and Q4 in particular specifically as we don't have the comparison for 2018, maybe there is any seasonality in marketing for personnel expenses, particularly between Q3 and Q4.\", 'Grigorii Moiseev', \"Slava, as you know, our cost based out – specifically our marketing expenses are very discretionary, especially when it comes to digital marketing before it may change. It's not custom installed. We generally have this year a smooth allocation of our marketing expenses throughout the year. For example, last year we had significantly higher allocation first quarter, while this year it's smaller. But the exact allocation between Q3, Q4 would also depend on the competitive environment. So, I don't think we can actually comment very precisely now.\", 'Vyacheslav Degtyarev', 'Okay. Thank you much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Miriam Adisa of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Miriam Adisa', \"Two questions from me. Firstly, could you just comment on the current macro environment and what you're seeing in terms of current trading, and any impact the environment could be having on your customer acquisition or if it's changing behavior of certain customers as well. And then also, if you could just comment on what you're currently expecting in terms of macro environment going into the second half in terms of what this implies and your guidance? Thank you.\", 'Mikhail Zhukov', \"Thanks Miriam. I'll take your questions. As you see, we just posted – in our view, a very strong first half results on the backdrop of slowing economy. So, we’re generally satisfied with these dynamics, and to some extent it just shows that the business – our business has lots of secure growth drivers that are not directly linked to the economic cycle. And also our leadership and our business model based on subscriptions actually helps to smooth out any volatility. Having said that, slowing economy doesn't help us either. We are seeing but from the economy both on the key accounts in small and medium business revenues. We are actually operating in the environment, where the vast majority of our clients either not expanding their headcount at all. Right, so mostly we're helping them to replace their existing headcount or they're going through a very heightened scrutiny, very harsh budgeting process when approving HR budgets, especially expansion budgets, right.\", 'So from the one end, it creates high necessity and efficient online solutions that we deliver versus traditional word of mouth or some other less-efficient off-line channels. On the other hand, that limits our upsell opportunity for add-on products, right, i.e., ARPC development.', \"So on balance we believe that in the upward moving economic cycle we would grow even faster, at a pretty much high rate but at the same time we haven't experienced significant impacts on our business. So you’d see that we are still growing at very decent rates. And we do not expect the further economic development somehow affect our guidance or expectations for the remaining part of the year.\", 'Miriam Adisa', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Maria Sukhanova of BCS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Maria Sukhanova', \"Yes. Good afternoon, congrats on results. I have two questions. First on the number of your key accounts in Moscow and St. Petersburg, could you please comment why there is a small decline? It's related to, like, is it a trend? Or it just a technical thing? And second, if you could, comment on what's happening with this antitrust litigation? What’s the issue right now? Thank you.\", 'Mikhail Zhukov', \"Thanks, Maria. What would you see in Q2, in terms of key accounts dynamics in Moscow, St. Petersburg? I would rather call it the optical decrees, which is 1% and that is caused by a number of technical factors including quantification of companies between Key Accounts and SMBs when they are changing [indiscernible] for example, net value, et cetera. So we don't see it in six months numbers for instance. And we expect this impact would straight away on the annual numbers.\", 'Speaking of general direction and key accounts in Moscow, we deem this to be a goal is to sort of saturation point and largely all the growth what we see from Moscow and key accounts coming from monetization improvement, 70% in Q2.', \"And on the anti-trust, a few days ago that probably the only update a few days ago, FAS announced that they dropped the case against Superjob and Rabota stating absence of violation. Nevertheless, they noted that the case against HeadHunter still continues, so we haven't seen the official decree or can’t speak away from the ground of the decision, but anyways, we can see that this as positive side or negative for us.\", 'Maria Sukhanova', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you, Maria. Next question comes from the line of Ivan Kim of Xtellus Capital. Your line is open.', 'Ivan Kim', \"Yes. Hi, I have three questions from my side please. Firstly, on the top of my brand awareness, which is very strong, you launched the marketing campaign at the same time of September on which I just wanted to understand, that'd be better why you need to invest again more, even though you are so much ahead of your competition, that’s the first question.\", \"The second question is on the revenue market sharing, 2018, can you share some information on that with us please? And then lastly on the competition in general, so what do you see is going on in the competitive field with, I don't know, the latest development with Sberbank acquiring Rabota with new owner of Workey, what Yandex Talent do? Any color on what do you see at the moment as the biggest competitive threat would be, very helpful. Thank you.\", 'Mikhail Zhukov', \"Thanks Ivan. Maybe I will deal with the second one, the easiest one and the simplest one. We don't know numbers of revenue for our competitors, unfortunately none of them really report disclosed, therefore, I can’t comment on the revenue market share. So in terms of we are very satisfied with the operating statistics that you see, operational KPIs, like sharing job postings and CVs, et cetera, right? So this could be used as a proxy, but I wouldn't probably speak about it on the revenue side here.\", 'Then in terms of top-of-mind brand awareness, we’re actually analyzing our marketing spend across whole Russia and we’re assessing cost of acquisition of new candidates very rigorously and regularly and we see that cost of acquisition is not growing that fast. So we see very good returns on marketing campaigns both off-line and in digital. And we saw in other markets when the top-of-mind brand awareness was even higher and the gap was the second player was even bigger, and this is what we aim for because we believe that this really drives the key competitive advantage of our business to traffic and also this results in a very low acquisitional cost for new clients, SMBs.', \"And as you saw from our result it’s the biggest growth driver at the moment. As we drive our brand awareness across Russia, we would just enjoy lower and lower and cheaper acquisition of new clients. We don't really see that. First of all, if you compare that last year we decreased slightly marketing spent is potential for revenue, but we don't think that we should actually decrease it significantly at this point of time.\", \"And then on the competition, I would say that there haven't been any significant changes to the competitive environment since we last spoke. As I said, we are pleased with our own dynamics at operating financial and hard to compare directly with the peers. So with regards to short term competitors you mentioned, we know there is some high activity from work in mail and in Android store. But same time we are confidently holding leadership in number of downloads by big margin and also we defended our topmost position in store ranking.\", \"With still competitors more effective, especially in Q3 on TV and the digital video, for example, doesn't surprise us, because we are obviously entering a new business season and many companies allocate higher budget to [indiscernible]. So I would say that on balance, there's nothing that would force us to reconsider our original tactics and budget for the year, so everything within expectations.\", \"And on Sberbank, Rabota again, I don't think they disclosed any incremental, meaningful information. As far as we understand, they tried to upgrade their significantly aged platform. That's their main focus at the moment. And we didn't witness any significant changes or improvements in the operating metrics or any high scale marketing activity as of yet for nothing takes place, no major update here as well.\", 'Ivan Kim', 'Okay. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Svetlana Sukhanova of Sberbank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Svetlana Sukhanova', 'Good afternoon everyone and congratulations on strong results. My question would be on effective tax rate. As far as I recall, you were guiding for about 27.5% effective tax rate for the full 2019. It was higher than a 40% in Q1 and slightly below 40% in Q2. So is it kind of guidance, 27.5% is still on track? And my first question here.', 'And second, would you please elaborate about the reasons for high ETR in the second quarter and how your Russian tax residency has affected your ETR in the second quarter? Thank you very much.', 'Grigorii Moiseev', \"Yes. Svetlana, thanks. As I said, I think before we have substantial IPO related costs in Q2, which are non-deductible just because they sort of – it's not possible to relate them to the operating profits of HeadHunter, right? So if we exclude this IPO related expenses, which obviously one off the effective tax rate is 29.5% and that is actually lower than 33% in 2018. So we frankly are on track in this guidance. We gave on the last call, and we expect to achieve 27%, 28% in – for the full-year results, excluding the one off IPO relates expenses.\", \"And also on the Russian tax residency, it's actually a lot to increase in the effective tax rate, but on the contrary because the applicable tax rate for dividend payments in our group is now zero percent, that actually decreases the effective tax rates. So it's already accounted for in our guidance. If not for this change, it would be probably 15% higher as this is the applicable rate for the dividend distributions from Russia to Cyprus holding company?\", 'Svetlana Sukhanova', \"Thank you very much. Of course, it's very clear for me that Russian residency decreases effective tax rate. My question was more if it had any kind of effect on you in the second quarter, Grigorii?\", 'Grigorii Moiseev', \"Oh I see. Well not in terms of any – I don't know particular amounts we would include in our PML, in income tax, but as we do not include this 15% tax rate on dividends anymore and in the Q2 as well. Of course, it had the impact on the couple numbers.\", 'Svetlana Sukhanova', 'Good. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.', 'Grigorii Moiseev', 'Thanks everyone.'], ['Winnebago Industries, Inc.

And there are a number of reasons for that. We are currently closing our fourth quarter financials. We have two big retail shows that happened this time of year, one was just completed in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and another is coming up in the near future in California. And in the industry signature order event, the Open House event is set to happen in the week of September 23 in Elkhart.

While attendance was down for the show, we are extremely optimistic about what transpired during the show for our businesses. All three of our current RV businesses, Winnebago Motor homes, Winnebago Towables, and Grand Design RV were up at retail in the show year-over-year double-digit percentage versus last fall. This is extremely encouraging to us about the vitality of the retail environment going forward.', 'The other thing that I was most pleased about was the mix of the products being retailed was encouraging both within our businesses, but anecdotally what I heard being at the show last week, there was a good mix of products being retailed across the Board. And what was encouraging and especially relevant to this announcement today is that BigIron, the larger motorhomes were moving nicely during the show last week in Hershey, and I can speak to that specifically in terms of the Winnebago Motorhome side, we saw a number of good retail sales on both, some of our Class A gas and Class A diesel models.', 'In regards to the timing of this transaction, in our announcement today about investing in another premium brand in the industry, rest assured that we remain confident of the prospects of the North American RV industry both in the long-term, but also in the short-term. We are extremely realistic about what has happened in the last 18 months, but we are confident that the RV lifestyle is not disappearing and continues to be healthy in many ways. And our Winnebago Industries’ current and now emerging collection of brands is poised to continue outgrowing the industry. So, I wanted to open with that to give you a little bit of my own flavor on where things stand in the industry, but also relevant specifically to the Hershey Show last week in Pennsylvania.', 'As many of you have heard me talk before, we have an ambitious goal of transforming Winnebago Industries into a premier outdoor lifestyle company made up of brands that have common threads around quality, innovation, and service. In our view and you’ll hear that premium is the word of the day, but in our view that means premium brands, premium products, premium channels, premium talent, and hopefully premium profitability overtime. And thus, I’m excited to announce that the next step in the transformation of our company is the acquisition of the Newmar Corporation in the signing of a definitive agreement that we have pointing towards a mid-November close to acquire Newmar.', 'So, I will reference Slide 3 in the investor deck that was released this morning. We will be adding Newmar to our portfolio of leading brands and significantly expanding our RV platform in a $344 million cash and stock transaction. The purchase price represents an attractive valuation for the unique opportunity to add the industry’s fastest-growing brand of Class A and Super-C motorhomes to our portfolios. We believe this is a fair price for the seller, but we also strongly believe that this is a responsible price for Winnebago Industries as the buyer.', 'The acquisition of Newmar aligns with our strategy to strengthen and re-energize our motorized segment and business by enhancing our position and capabilities in the motorhome market and building on the progress that we have made driving growth and innovation across all of our RV offerings. Newmar’s talented leadership team, high-quality dealer network, and premium Class A and Super-C offerings will enhance the capabilities and profitability of our motorhome segment. They will expand our overall RV portfolio and footprint in North America, and we anticipate it will drive significant value creation for our employees, customers, and shareholders.', 'I will move to Slide 4 in the investor deck. I’d like to take a minute now to set the backdrop of how this fits into our ongoing transformation efforts here at the company. As many of you know, when I had the privilege of joining Winnebago Industries in January 2016, our Board of Directors set three simple priorities to guide our path forward: number one, restore our leadership in the motorized RV segment; number two, establish a compelling Towables RV platform becoming more relevant and competitive; and number three, diversify into profitable diversification, potentially the entrance into adjacent outdoor lifestyle segments.', 'As we are now entering fiscal 2020, we have made tremendous progress against this mandate that our Board gave us in early 2016 there are proof points against each of those priorities. As we think about leadership in the motorhome business, our goal is less about scale and more about positioning Winnebago Industries as the manufacturer of choice of the best line of motorized products and brands available in the market. With the addition of Newmar’s high-quality brand to our portfolio, we are taking significant step forward towards that goal.', 'At the same time, we remain unwavering in our commitment to the Winnebago brand of RVs as well and making those products more competitive in the market. We continue to drive growth in Class B and make progress executing operational improvements across the Winnebago brand. And together with Newmar in the future, we will have a formidable line of high-quality innovative products across the motorized segment.', 'In relation to the second priority that Board gave us, we created a compelling Towables platform with the 2016 acquisition of Grand Design RV, which added balance to our core RV business with the fastest-growing Towables offering in the history of the industry and by driving significant organic growth concurrently within our own Winnebago branded Towables business. And finally, we’ve taken strategic steps to expand our scale and profitability through diversification into adjacent outdoor lifestyle brands.', 'In addition to today’s acquisition of Newmar’s premium Class A and Super-C motorhomes and the acquisition of Grand Design Towable lineup in 2016, the 2018 acquisition of Chris-Craft enabled us to enter the Marine space with the most iconic brand in that industry. We have dramatically expanded our revenue and profitability across the premium portfolio businesses, and we think we have an incredible platform that will position us for future growth going forward.', 'I will move to Slide 5 in the investor deck. Newmar’s premium motorhome portfolio is highly complementary to our current RV offering. And their tremendous growth trajectory both here recently but also we believe in the future their strong relationships with their dealer channel and talented employees provide us with a platform from which we can drive future growth through organic expansion opportunities.', 'Through this transaction, Winnebago Industries will be home to three of the best brands in all of the RV industry: Newmar, Winnebago and Grand Design, each offering differentiated products to the RV market. Beyond the numerous strategic benefits of this transaction, we believe strongly that our two companies are a strong cultural fit. Through our many conversations with the Newmar leadership team, the strong similarities in our values became clear. As we both consider a business model around quality, innovation and customer service as founding principles for our business. And we share a common focus as well on establishing deep relationships with our dealers, our suppliers and in customers.', 'We have long admired the Newmar team for their craftsmanship and commitment to excellence. They have some beautiful products in their lineup. We look forward to adding another high-end business to our collaborative culture and sharing best practices, while maintaining the unique brand identities that have made each of our RV businesses and brands successful.', 'From a financial perspective, this acquisition enhances the scale and profitability of Winnebago’s overall motorhome business and greatly improves our cash flow generation, which we expect will translate to immediate accretion to the fiscal 2020 cash EPS.', 'In addition in the same way we approach driving continuous operational improvement through our acquisition of Grand Design, we believe that Newmar’s experienced leadership team and their team across their company along with their strong manufacturing processes will create opportunities to drive synergies across the whole of our motorhome segment. At the same time, we also feel confident that the terms of our agreement allow Winnebago Industries to maintain ample balance sheet flexibility to continue investing in our business, while quickly deleveraging and delivering value to our shareholders, even in a challenging macro market.', 'I will now move to Slide 6 in the investor deck. Taking a step back, I will take a moment now to introduce Newmar to those of you who may be unfamiliar with the brand and it is one of the leading brands in the RV industry. One of the key things we look for in an acquisition opportunity are brands that are authentic and have lasting heritage with significant future runway that complements our own Winnebago flagship brand. Newmar certainly has that. As for over 50 years, the company has been a leader in the RV industry. Based out of Nappanee, Indiana Newmar manufacturers a full line of premium Class A luxury, diesel and gas motorhomes through 11 model families. Newmar also recently entered the Super C category with its award-winning Super Star model that many of us had a chance to see for the first time at the RVX Show this spring.', 'Newmar’s strong performance in recent years has been driven by its unique production model focused on high margin customized products backed by significant investment in customer service. Newmar also has a highly developed dealer network across North America, that they have worked extremely hard to support through highly protected DMAs and consistent investment in training and service enhancements.', 'In return, Newmar dealers truly embrace the brand and commit to carrying their lineup. There is minimal overlap in this network with the rest of our dealer network as less than a third of Newmar’s 57 dealers also carry a Winnebago or Grand Design product, creating a real opportunity for our overall company to broaden those dealer relationships even further.', 'Matt Miller, Newmar’s President and CEO and his team have done a great job running the business and driving consistent growth across market cycles. The company generated revenue of $661 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $55.2 million as of the last 12 months, June of 2019 representing compound annual growth rates of nearly 20% for each respectively since 2013. This has truly been a business on the move. Newmar’s strong performance, deep industry relationships and esteemed reputation among RV enthusiast is due to the hard work of a very strong, passionate new Newmar team.', 'Matt Miller and the entire management team brings exceptional experience and a wealth of best practices that we look forward to leveraging across the entire Winnebago industries portfolio. We are confident that adding Newmar to the Winnebago industries family is a tremendous opportunity for our company to create enhanced value for our customers, dealers and shareholders.', 'I will move to Slide 7 in the investor deck. Drilling down more deeply into Newmar’s offering. Newmar has an incredibly attractive and premium product portfolio of luxury diesel and gas Class A motorhomes. With 11 model families, the Newmar portfolio is focused, yet needs a wide range of needs for RV enthusiasts through a true dedication to customization. Each one of these products and series reflects Newmar’s dedication to providing customers with an unrivaled ownership experience that includes incorporating leading edge entertainment and safety technology with impeccable craftsmanship.', 'In addition, Newmar has some of the most advanced engineering in the industry with performance features like comfort drive, adaptable steering technology and a custom built Starr Foundation along with luxurious residential appointments and decor packages that include handmade cabinetry. Newmar also offers Winnebago an innovative platform to expand organically into adjacent markets. As evidenced by the recent unveiling of its 2020 Super Star model of Super C motorhomes, and Newmar’s mobility offering featuring disabled accessibility options.', 'At this year’s RVX Show in March, I had the opportunity to see firsthand Newmar Super C model the Super Star. It is an impressive product and it received incredible feedback that week, including a category Spotlight award. The Super C category is one of the fastest growing markets in the industry and we are really excited about the Super Star’s potential and Newmar’s venture into this segment. We believe Newmar has a platform from which they can drive additional expansion opportunities overtime.', 'In the broader context of Winnebago industries, RV portfolio, the addition of Newmar means, we are bringing three tremendous brands under our operations to present truly full line coverage of RVs to the marketplace. This transaction fills out our offering and will allow Winnebago industries to provide the full spectrum of RV options to customers across the market from stick-and-tin towables to high end premium diesel motorhomes.', 'And we’ll move to Slide 8 in the presentation deck. Newmar’s unique production model is also a compelling part of this transaction. Newmar has built a tremendous reputation and loyal following from its customers and dealers through a half century of handcrafting customized motorhomes with an unwavering commitment to quality service and innovation. These three tenants, as I mentioned before, the foundational common thread running through each of our Winnebago industries brands.', 'Newmar’s ability to profitably customize its RV products, excuse me, while maintaining best-in-class customer service sets it apart from its other competitors and truly puts Newmar in a league of its own. Over 50% of Newmar sales are from customized products that are built to order. This impressive feed is made possible because a Newmar’s customer focused approach to product development and its best-in-class production model, that employees talented employees with a commitment to craftsmanship and innovation and an average of eight years of manufacturing experience across their floor.', 'Newmar’s manufacturing operations and staff have the flexibility to quickly meet the evolving needs of today’s RV customers by engaging them directly in the design and build process through annual events and product walkthrough. Newmar’s reputation for providing high-quality customer service is seen by many as a major catalyst behind its tremendous market share growth in recent years.', 'With 55 service centers across the country with their dealer partners and plans to launch a new mobile service offering, Newmar’s commitment to service is second to none. This approach to quality and service is reflected in Newmar’s dealer net promoter scores, which are amongst the highest in the industry, having scored 191% in the last two years, respectively.', 'I will move to Slide 9 in the presentation deck. There is no doubt that Newmar’s uncompromising approach to quality and service is behind its tremendous growth that they’ve been able to achieve. The company has demonstrated a unique ability to outpace the Class A diesel market, which accounts for roughly 70% of its overall sales.', 'Since 2013, Newmar has a consistent track record of gaining market share, delivering a 22% compound annual growth rate over that period. In stark contrast to just 2% for the overall Class A diesel market. Digging down even further, Newmar has positioned themselves incredibly well in the high end, high margin portions of the market with significant share in motorhomes priced above 200% and even more presence in motorhomes priced above $400,000.', 'I will move to Slide 10 in our deck. Now during our evaluation process, it became apparent that Newmar’s premium product line was highly complementary to the current Winnebago branded motorhomes lineup. Newmar offers six RV models in the $400,000 to $1 million high-end motorhome segment, which is not an area that our Winnebago brand of RVs has traditionally plays in.', 'Newmar’s premium models will serve to nicely extend our reach and add balance across the segments, fill in the gaps where we traditionally have not had a competitive model or presence. As you can tell, I’m extremely excited about the opportunity to add this brand into our portfolio and look forward to further questions in the Q&A session later in this call.', 'With that, I will turn the call over to Bryan Hughes, and he will walk you through the financial highlights of this transaction. Bryan?', 'Bryan Hughes', 'Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. I will pick up on Slide 11, which is titled transaction overview. As you saw on our announcement, total consideration for Newmar is approximately $344 million comprised of a combination of cash in Winnebago shares. The transaction also includes tax assets valued at over $30 million.', 'Including the value of these tax assets, the purchase price implies a multiple of 5.2 times, Newmar’s last 12 months adjusted EBITDA combined with expected net synergies of approximately $5 million. This transaction will greatly improve Winnebago’s financial scale and profitability. The combined company will have approximately $2.7 billion in pro forma revenue and will be well positioned to drive growth and improve the profitability over time.', 'The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Winnebago Industries growth profile, motorized profit margins and consolidated cash EPS, excluding transaction cost and including anticipated synergies. We anticipate realizing a minimum of $5 million of annual run rate net cost synergies over the first three years, driven predominantly by purchasing opportunities, the elimination of redundant processes and sharing of manufacturing best practices.', 'In recent years, we have demonstrated a strong ability to efficiently capture synergies across our businesses having meaningfully overachieved our targets for Grand Design and Chris-Craft. Over time, we expect to achieve additional upsides by leveraging Newmar’s premium platform to expand their motorhome offering behind its – beyond its core Class A products. However, it is important to know that at this time no additional benefits have been reflected in our current projections with this transaction.', 'In regards to cash flow, we expect the acquisition of Newmar to significantly enhance our cash flow. This will allow us to prioritize repaying the debt that we will be taking on as part of this transaction. Following the close of the transaction, we expect to have a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.1 time with the goal of deleveraging to within our range of 0.9 times to 1.5 times by the end of fiscal 2020.', 'Following the close of the transaction, which we expect by the end of our first quarter 2020, Newmar will operate as a distinct business unit within Winnebago Industries with headquarters remaining in Nappanee, Indiana. Newmar’s manufacturing facilities will remain in place and Matt Miller will continue to lead the Newmar business post-closing as its President.', 'Flipping now to Slide 12 on the deck. Taking a look at the snapshot of the combined company. The acquisition provides Winnebago with greater overall scale with, as I mentioned earlier, nearly $2.7 billion in pro forma revenue.', 'From a profitability perspective, we expect this transaction to expand our motorhome EBITDA margin by 200 basis points from just over 4% to mid-6% as we benefit from Newmar strong position in the premium Class A diesel market and entire margin product mix. The transaction also significantly expands our overall position in the class A market, an attractive $3.2 billion in product segment.', 'flipping now to slide 13, from a financing perspective, we expect to pay for this transaction with a combination of cash and stock. The cash component, which is approximately $270 million, will be financed primarily by committed financing from Goldman Sachs and Bank of Montreal. Takeout financing will be determined with the partnership of Goldman Sachs and Bank of Montreal at the end of October following the release of our financial results for our fiscal 2019 and our 10-K filing. With the stock component, the company will issue 2 million Winnebago shares to newmar’s ownership, representing approximately 6% of pro forma Winnebago shares outstanding.', 'Upon closing, we expect to maintain a solid liquidity position with more than $200 million in liquidity at close and strong cash flows to support rapid debt repayment. So, although our leverage will increase in the short term, we expect the attractive financial profile of the combined company to help us return to our targeted levels rather quickly.', 'Turning to Slide 14, as many of you, who follow the Winnebago, already know, we have a track record of disciplined leverage management. We have always said that we would be willing to lever up to capture the right market opportunity as evidenced by the Grand Design and Chris-Craft acquisitions. After the close of each transaction, we have demonstrated our ability to quickly delever, bringing our debt metric back to levels within our target range. We expect to follow the same approach with our financing of the Newmar acquisition.', 'With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike to provide some closing comments. Mike?', 'Michael Happe', 'Thank you, Bryan. We will move to slide 15 in the investor presentation. And as we mentioned earlier, the acquisition of Newmar is very aligned with the core areas that our enterprise is focused on in terms of strategic direction. On this slide, I’ve listed our five key strategies that we’ve been very focused on and disciplined about for the last number of years. They include building a high performance culture, strengthening and expanding our core RV business, elevating excellence in operations, leveraging innovation and digital engagement and finally expanding to new profitable markets.', 'We believe Newmar is a great fit with many of these key strategies. We are adding an incredibly talented management team to further enhance our performance culture. We are absolutely strengthening and reenergizing our motorized business, and undoubtedly, we are further diversifying our business into new and profitable market segments like the luxury class A and our Super C segment.', 'Now on slide 16, you will see that looking across our growing portfolio of brands; we are extremely excited about the transaction and the key spot it fills. With this deal, we now have truly premium products to offer our customers across motorhomes, towables, and the marine markets. In addition, our iconic Winnebago brand broadly serves our middle market RV customers with both segments of its motorhomes and towables lines.', 'We are proud of the bold steps we have taken in the past number of years, the success we have been able to achieve, and our strong growing and differentiated competitive position in the market. Newmar is a logical next step in this progression and together we are creating a more profitable company with a stronger platform from which we can drive future growth and increase resiliency through the economic cycle.', 'We are extremely excited about our organic prospects. And as Bryan talked about with our responsible management of the balance sheet, we will be poised again someday in the future to now continue looking at more additions, particularly and potentially the diversification of the portfolio in the outdoor lifestyle markets.', 'In summary, we are confident that Newmar is a great fit for Winnebago Industries and we look very much forward to welcoming them to the family and continuing to drive growth and long-term value for our employees, customers, and shareholders.', 'Thank you for this time – your time this morning. and with that, we will now open the call for your questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is now open.', 'Craig Kennison', 'Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, on the motorhome side, you’ve been engaged in a process to improve the profitability of the Winnebago branded motorhome business. What does this transaction say about how you feel like that’s progressing and to what extent can you leverage knowhow at Newmar to drive better results there?', 'Michael Happe', 'Yes. Good morning, Craig, and thanks for your questions. We have, as you’ve stated, been very focused on investing in and restoring vitality to our Winnebago branded motorhome business. And in some areas of that particular business, we think we’ve done a really good job of strengthening the business. Probably, the areas that I can point to specifically there are the Class B products where we have significant leading market share in the North American market, and also our strong performance in Class C diesel over time. We have not been as successful in recent years with strengthening that business and some of the other product categories to the degree that we would have liked.', 'We have stabilized the business in many ways and made some very tough decisions, i.e. closing down the Junction City, Oregon campus in an effort to refocus on North Iowa being our motorhome center of excellence for the Winnebago-brand. So there continues to be runway there. I will be in North Iowa tomorrow on Tuesday, and I will be spending significant time with our team there explaining this transaction, but also very much supporting and challenging them to continue their forward progress on restoring that brand of motorhomes to a great place in the industry. We are no less focused because of this acquisition on our Winnebago branded motorhome business.', 'That being said, the Newmar line offers a very complementary business that we can add to the portfolio, both in terms of products above $200,000, but also in terms of dealer relationships. And we felt that it would be really beneficial to have another premium brand of motorhomes in our lineup to not only create incremental value for the organization, but as your last part of your question infers that we could learn something from having another successful premium brand of motorhomes in the line.', 'Matt Miller, the President and CEO of Newmar, who will report directly to me, will also be a Vice President in Winnebago Industries and an Executive Officer, and he will be a strategic advisor to the Winnebago motorhome business. Working closely with Brian Hazelton, the leader of that business, and Brian Hazelton and myself, Matt Miller, Bryan Hughes, we will work closely together to make sure that the Newmar business retains its vitality and its forward momentum, and we look forward to Matt contributing to help us find synergy and leverage the addition of Newmar so that we can benefit on the Winnebago branded motorhome side as well.', 'So, I hope that answers your question, but we’re excited still about both businesses. We do not view this in any way, shape, or form as an excuse to not continue to strengthen the Winnebago branded motorhomes.', 'Craig Kennison', 'That helps. And then a second question, just on the economic cycle. How has Newmar performed in economic downturns in the past? And to what extent does the custom business model mean there’s less inventory in the channel, so less of that inventory correction dynamic that has plagued the industry recently?', 'Michael Happe', 'Bryan Hughes, would you like to take Craig’s question?', 'Bryan Hughes', 'Yes. Mike, I didn’t catch it. So I’m going ask you to carry it.', 'Michael Happe', 'So, the first part of Craig’s question is Newmar’s performance in the down cycle, and I’ll speak topline and Bryan, if you could add any specifics from your standpoint. But Craig, we’ve had extensive conversations with Matt and his team about their performance in previous RV downcycles. The most recent one, fortunately before potentially the little dip that we’re in the midst of now as an industry, but the previous one is you’re well aware of was back in the 2008, and 2009 time period. And the one thing I’ll comment on, and Bryan can share some, some specifics about the variability of their cost model, but Newmar was really in a different place back then as well. Matt admits that their products were not as strong as they are today. Their placement were , their dealers were not as strong as they are today. In fact, they maybe didn’t even have some of the right dealers at the time back in 2008 and 2009.', 'And they saw, like a number of the other motorhome manufacturers in the RV Industry, they saw a really significant decrease in their business during that great financial crisis, which is, I think we all know is an extreme case of RV cyclicality to the negative. But through the strengthening of the Newmar business over the last eight to nine years, Matt and now Winnebago feels very confident that their business is in much better shape in terms of their position with the dealers, the strength and the value of their product offering, so that in downturn, such as potentially the one that – the slight one that we’ve been seeing here recently they are in a position to actually gain share during those downturns, even if their business prospects lessen a little bit on the topline. But Bryan, I’ll ask you to speak to maybe the variability of their cost model, how that compares to what we have as well in our portfolio.', 'Bryan Hughes', 'Yes. The variability of the cost model is similar in terms of – we have historically stated 85% to 90% variable. Newmar cost structure is similar in that manner. They have maintained the highly variable structure such that any kind of downturn, they’re able to manage their capacity, manage their variable costs such that it protects in that down cycle. So, I think you’ll find Craig that he’s very familiar to our Winnebago model in that regard.', 'Michael Happe', 'Craig, one last thing I’ll add to Bryan’s comments is the current Newmar model is extremely efficient from a pull standpoint. They work very well with their existing dealers to make sure that there’s a commitment between the dealer and the OEM about what they will carry, but a high percentage if not all of the production that is going down their manufacturing line has a dealer name or even a retailer name on it. They do not build open stock or open inventory, they build to the orders that are in front of them. And in many cases, there’s an actual retail customer order.', 'It’s actually a very similar model to our Chris-Craft brand, and their business highly customized, highly premium, the customers and the dealers are involved in the configuration of many of the products, over 50% of them. But the Newmar team is quite disciplined in making sure that they build to what the market really wants, and that’s all based on retail.', 'Craig Kennison', 'Thanks. And my last question is on the customer profile you alluded to recently. What would that customer profile look like? Is that a baby boomer? And to what extent are you concerned about any sort of demographic changes that might take place over the next decade that could either benefit you or not benefit you with respect to the transaction?', 'Michael Happe', 'Thank you, Craig, for that question. We’ve not really have – we don’t have great quantitative research across, the whole of the industry on that question other than the Newmar customer in our belief is both more affluent, but probably a little bit older than the average RV customer certainly folks that are buying a may be $25,000 Towables product. Is there a risk that over time with the baby boomer segment slowing down that those types of customers could disappear, we don’t believe that’s a material risk for a number of reasons that Newmar team is quite focused on listening to the needs of their customers and whatever changes in customer preferences start to emerge in the marketplace, we believe that the Newmar team will respond to quite effectively.', 'Additionally though, the affluency of that customer we believe like Chris-Craft protects the Newmar brand a little bit in times where the economic uncertainty in the market is a bit jittery. And I think we’re seeing that again today is that Newmar’s business has continued strong even in this calendar year, running well above the industry pace on retail and shipments for the segments that they compete in. The Winnebago team is, from my standpoint, again quite focused on where the puck is going in the future. And that’s one of the reasons they entered the Super-C segment. And I won’t divulge any of our other conversations, but we very much have discussed that we’re buying a platform, we’re not buying a Class A company. We’re buying another premium branded motorized RV platform that we can use in a number of ways in the future to attack the markets.', 'So yes, they have to stay nimble to make sure that they can migrate from their traditional customer if needed, but still thousands of baby boomers retiring everyday and still great demand. And as I said, at the Hershey show in Pennsylvania last week, one of the most positive factors that I heard anecdotally, qualitatively was that the big motorhomes were moving again. And that was a little bit different than a year ago at Hershey. So I’m cautiously optimistic about what that signals here in terms of retail stability.', 'Craig Kennison', 'Great, congratulations. See you next week.', 'Michael Happe', 'Thank you, Craig.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve O’Hara with Sidoti. Your line is now open.', 'Steve O’Hara', 'Hi, good morning.', 'Michael Happe', 'Good morning.', 'Steve O’Hara', 'Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious about going after may be more of the premium market, I mean, it seems like a lot of the growth in the past has been skewed toward more of the entry level and this kind of goes back to more of the premium market. I’m just wondering what your thoughts are on your ability to kind of tap that market and provide products into that market if that market continues to lead the growth when it does come back?', 'Michael Happe', 'Yes, thank you. Well, I mean to be quite direct, we’re trying to build a premium-branded company that is, as I’ve said in past calls, is particularly effective. If you think about good, better, best in a simple positioning framework, we want to be a company that is significantly successful in better and especially best. And so this fits who we are and where we’re going. We certainly have some value products in our line, especially with some of the Winnebago branded RVs and motorhomes and Towables and certain segments.', 'Grand Design entered the high end of the Stick-and-Tin business here in the last 1.5 years. So on occasion, we’ll play offense or defense in some of those value categories to make sure that we’re still participating in significant markets of scale. But this was a part of our line that we were candidly absent in and very directly. It’s not going away. It’s – the demise of the class A business and specifically Class A diesels is overstated. It’s still a multiple billion dollar segment, and Newmar has been running far above the industry pace in terms of taking market share there. So we believe this is one of the core differences in terms of differentiation between us and some of our primary competitors is that we’re looking for companies that will be very successful in those better, best segments.', 'And we believe that over time that business model around great product quality, value differentiation, superior customer service, I actually feel that that’ll move some of the volume up our way over time, that customers in the Marine and the RV industries are looking for better experience than perhaps what they’ve been given in the past. So certainly, we respect that folks could question whether this was an investment in a thin air segment that we’ll get a return on, we’re highly confident that that will be the case. And in fact, as I just said minutes ago, we’re buying an RV platform, we’re buying a brand and getting access to a team and a channel that has the ability to do other things with this brand if we so choose in the future. So we think it’s a great fit.', 'Steve O’Hara', 'Okay. And then just maybe Newmar’s CapEx needs in terms of needs in terms of going forward. I mean it sounds like they have been better than market and I’m just wondering where there are in terms of expansion – capacity expansion needs, et cetera, things like that. Thank you.', 'Michael Happe', 'Bryan, why don’t you speak directly the CapEx?', 'Bryan Hughes', 'You bet. Right now looking back to our history, Steve, you could see CapEx as a percent of sales that is not too different off – from Winnebago’s experience. They’ve been investing to speed their growth and their maintenance CapEx is probably in that 1% to 2% range top as they continue to grow and as they have projected as part of our discussion so far, they obviously expect to continue to grow. There will be CapEx requirements in the next three years to five years that would need to fund that growth and we stand ready to support them in that of course. And so I don’t think you’ll see a CapEx profile that’s certainly different than Winnebago so to answer your question very directly.', 'Steve O’Hara', 'Okay. Alright, thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup. Your line is now open.', 'Fred Wightman', 'Fred Wightman on for Greg. I get that the Newmar deal is you’re viewing it as a platform, but you’d also talked about the Chris-Craft deal as a platform too. So can you just sort of help us think about RV acquisitions going forward versus M&A in the marine space?', 'Michael Happe', 'Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Fred. This acquisition for us is about in many ways completing the journey to build a full line of RV products across towables and motorhomes in that better best segment. And as I stated in my prepared comments, having the Winnebago, Grand Design and Newmar brands canvassing stick-and-tin product, high-end diesel is certainly a dramatically different position than we were in 3.5 years to 4 years ago.', 'We had less than 3% share as a company of the RV market in late 2015. And when we close on this transaction in the middle of December 2019, our market share in the North American RV market will now be into the double digits and it can continue to grow even higher. And the three brands that we now have in our portfolio, in my opinion, we’re in a great place to grow going forward. Is there a possibility that we could be further inorganically active in the RV space? We’ll sure. But boy, this is a strong step forward to completing in many ways the business model that we envisioned for North America.', 'We remain no less intense on our goal of becoming an outdoor lifestyle company with material presence in different outdoor lifestyle segments. M&A is sometimes about timing and what opportunities become available at certain times. We are very active in looking at other outdoor lifestyle segments and adjacencies in terms of what could be a good fit with our competencies, capabilities and a fit with the North Star that from a vision standpoint we’ve really put down as a guidepost. So, therefore, it is highly likely that someday in the future that we will expand, continue to expand outside of the RV industry. We are very pleased with Chris-Craft in its first year of results. They have exceeded our financial models that we based our M&A decision on.', 'The team has been strengthened and the new products that the Chris-Craft business have introduced into the market have been spectacular. And in fact, they are expanding their lineup dramatically. And as we announced in a previous earnings call, we are investing eight figures of capital into that business in order to expand their capacity. This is a low risk, high reward play to enter the marine market. And like we’ve mentioned many times, we believe the marine market long-term has a lot of the same secular characteristics of American consumers and in the marine case, even global consumers wanting to spend more time in the outdoors with families and friends in the marine case on the water. So this is a solidification and a strengthening of the RV part of our business.', 'And while Bryan was very right in the sense that we will be focusing on de-leveraging and reducing debt in the near term based on the successful cash flow from our current portfolio, we absolutely will remain active in building relationships and looking for opportunities in the marine and potentially some other spaces. So that diversification will happen. It’s a matter of time and then hopefully being right in terms of judgment with how we diversify going forward.', 'But even on the RV space, I feel much better about the strength of our business today, on September 16, 2019, than where we were when I joined the company on January 18 of 2016. We are much more financially sound and market competitive in the RV space and our ability to weather storms in that segment has been significantly enhanced from our point of view.', 'Fred Wightman', 'That’s really helpful. Thanks. And I understand that you’re not giving revenue synergies today, you sort of alluded to them a few times. But can you just talk about how far you think the Newmar brand could expand into motorized longer term?', 'Michael Happe', 'Yes. I won’t be specific with an answer to that question as you might imagine because of competitive concerns. But we will both remain focused on them being even more successful in the Class A segment on both diesel and luxury, but even the gas segment. And their team has material plans to do so with new products in the future. Their Super C business is just really getting started. Products are being shipped to the dealers as we speak, and they will have even a bigger presence in the Super C market in the future.', 'And as you can imagine, with the premium nature of their brand and the premium nature of their dealer relationships, there may be other high-end elements of other segments that we could look at in the future. But again, this first year is always important from a integration and a simulation standpoint. We’re always very careful about making sure that the team and the business fit well into our portfolio that first year, so that there are no surprises. And then as we’ve seen the Grand Design, going forward after that first year we hope the flywheel continues to spin even faster. So it’s a platform, but undoubtedly in this first-year we’ll be focused on what we do well already, which is Class A and now Super C.', 'Fred Wightman', 'Perfect. Thanks guys.', 'Michael Happe', 'Thank you, Fred.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.', 'Bret Jordan', 'Good morning.', 'Michael Happe', 'Good morning, Bret.', 'Bret Jordan', 'I think you commented about a third of the dealers have some overlap with your existing portfolio and Newmar. I guess what could that be down the road and I guess where do you see the greatest synergy? Would it be putting brand design or your Class B’s into dealers that currently carry Newmar or is there a potential to put Newmar product into some of your current Winnebago dealerships?', 'Michael Happe', 'Yes, thank you for the question. And I’ll explain really our approach here on having different brands and what the channel strategies emerge like what. For us, what’s important is that a transaction like this along with what we’ve done with the Grand Design business really increases hopefully, at least we hope it increases the credibility and the perception of strength that Winnebago Industries has in the North American RV industry.', 'This is still a market which is still essentially a duopoly with the significant share that our two largest competitors own. And we feel very strongly that a number of our dealers have been rooting for and desire a strong third presence from an OEM standpoint in the market. And certainly this move today gives us three brands that puts us in great position to add a more balanced third leg to the market stool.', 'We do not force placement of our brands and other dealers. To remind everybody and I know you’re well aware of this, but the RV industry is not a franchise dealer industry. These are independent dealers making their own decisions about what brands and companies that they want to work with. And they often choose those brands and companies based on their total cost or total profitability that they can generate with those brands. And so we believe that we have hot products, we believe we have great customer service support, we believe we’re easy to do business with that we can earn business.', 'But developing relationships with a broader array of dealers in the North American market is a good thing. They can get to know us. I will tell you since we purchased Grand Design and since we’ve invested significantly in standing up Winnebago Towables. There had been numerous instances where dealers have come to us proactively and said, we like what you’re building at Winnebago Industries with your brands and your businesses. We’d like to talk to you about something else in your portfolio that we don’t carry today that we might be interested in carrying.', 'So it just allows us the opportunity to strengthen our relationships overall with the dealers and just engage in conversations about where our brands best fit in the market. In addition to Matt Miller at Newmar we have strong leaders in each of our other RV businesses and they are empowered to make what are the best channel decisions for their businesses. But doing so working together, talking to each other about what they see in the market with that particular dealers portfolio and trajectory. So there will be synergy there. We won’t force it. If we do our jobs well, it will come naturally. We believe most of the other synergy – natural synergy that we’ll get will come from the manufacturing and supply chain side and the emergence of best practices across the value chain in terms of marketing, in terms of service and again in terms of operations.', 'We believe we can learn a lot from the Newmar team and fairly we believe that there might be some nuggets of best practices that can flow their way as well from our other businesses. And from that synergy will be created. But no doubt, we believe this helps our relationships with the broader dealer network and we hope that, that creates opportunity for some great discussions going forward about us gaining more lot share in this industry.', 'Bret Jordan', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Michael Happe', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. This concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Stuber for any closing remarks.', 'Steve Stuber', 'Great. Thank you everyone for joining our call today.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to your Champions Oncology First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and comments following the presentation.

Joining me today is David Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us on our quarterly earnings call.', \"Before I begin, I will remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call and that actual results could differ materially from what is described in those statements. Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available in our Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the call to GAAP financial measures is available in the earnings release.\", 'I will start by pointing out that our prepared comments for today will be relatively brief as we just recently provided our fiscal 2019 year-end results and company updates six weeks ago.', 'While there was a high level of activity since the last update, the fundamental vision and strategies for the coming quarters remain unchanged.', 'Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (sic) [2020] grew by more than 8% to $6.7 million compared to $6.2 million in the year-ago period. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, Champions had a loss of $300,000.', 'In looking at the quarter, revenue was below expectations, mostly due to normal fluctuations that we have discussed in the past, but our confidence remains high because of our increased bookings trends.', \"While with regard to expenses, we continued the trend of investing in new product capabilities and specifically, for this quarter, there's accounting changes for the way we accrue the commissions. \", \"Although those results are a little worse than expected, it's important to put them in the context of the company's long-term view, which will be my focus today. \", 'While quarterly results are important, the story for Champions is our pursuit for sustained revenue growth and profitability over the coming years. We will sacrifice near-term quarterly results for greater future financial successes.', 'Our insight into the longer-term prospects is not always visible in the quarterly numbers. This is not unfamiliar territory. A few years ago, our expenses outpaced revenue, but we were confident in our future as we saw the catalyst in place that would justify our investment and, ultimately, propel us to breakeven and then operational profitability.', 'We are in a similar position today. We continue to see strength in our core services. Our bookings are well outpacing quarterly expenses and those bookings will drive an increase in revenue over the year.', 'As we have been discussing, we have been focused on expanding our service offerings. Last year, we focused on setting up our lab to enable us to offer GLT and clinical flow cytometry services.', \"During the current quarter, we have begun aggressively selling and the level of interest is promising. We're in active discussions with customers and have several potential deals in front of us. We hope to be able to announce a deal in the near future.\", 'We have also launched the first part of our ex vivo platform, which will continue to evolve and expand over this fiscal year.', 'In addition to clinical flow services and an ex vivo platform, we have plans to continue adding to our product line, expanding our international footprint and exploring monetizing our data bank.', 'Each of these opportunities takes time to operationalize, but has the potential to meaningfully contribute to the long-term growth of the company. As these opportunities materialize, we will provide an update.', 'I hope the message is clear. The demand for our core services is strong and will drive higher revenue in the coming quarters and support the opportunity to reinvest in additional offerings which will lead to sustained revenue growth. ', \"While we are more focused on long-term revenue growth than the short-term profitability, we're keeping a close eye on cash and we're not going to put ourselves in a situation where we will need a capital raise to fund operations.\", 'Quarterly fluctuations should be viewed in the context of our long-term strategy and prospects and we remain confident in both.', 'Now, let me turn the call over to David Miller for a more detailed review of our financial results.', 'David Miller', 'Thanks Ronnie. Our full results on Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC later today. As discussed on our year-end call, Q1 revenue was expected to decline from Q4 levels. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was $6.7 million, an increase of 8.2% compared to $6.2 million in the same period last year.', 'Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, we recognized a loss of $300,000 compared to a gain of $675,000 in the year-ago period.', 'Our first quarter gross margin was 44% compared to 51% for the same period last year. Cost of sales was $3.77 million compared to $3.07 million, an increase of $700,000 or 23%. ', 'The increase in expense and reduction in gross margin was due to our higher bookings and studies in process and the recognition of associated expenses in advance of the revenue.', 'R&D expense was $1.3 million compared to $1.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of $200,000 or 20%. The increase is due to the continued development work to expand and enhance our product offering.', 'Sales and marketing expense was $848,000 compared to $511,000 last year, an increase of $337,000 or 66%.', 'The increase in sales and marketing was mainly due to two factors. First, we have continued to expand our sales force to opportunistically capitalize on the growing demand for our services.', 'Second is our treatment of commission. Historically, we did not accrue commissions over the course of the year as we waited until sales targets were achieved. This has led to higher sales and marketing expenses in our fourth quarters.', \"Since we are confident that our sales goals will be achieved, we have begun accruing commissions quarterly. This should lead to a more evenly distributed sales and marketing expense throughout fiscal year 2020, but it also contributes to the quarter's year-over-year increase. The combined impact of the sales team expansion and commission accrual was approximately $275,000.\", 'In total, our cash-based expenses were $7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $5.550 million in the same period last year, an increase of approximately $1.5 million. ', 'Similar to our treatment of commissions, we started accruing for year-end 2020 bonuses in the first quarter. The result should mitigate the annual expense spike in Q4, but in Q1 it added approximately another $75,000 to our total.', \"In summation, we had a $700,000 increase in cost of sales, $200,000 in additional R&D investments, $275,000 in sales and marketing, and $75000 in bonus accrual. While there will certainly be fluctuation, we believe the current quarter's expenses are a good baseline. And as the revenues grow, we expect to achieve cash-based profitability over the coming quarters.\", 'Now turning to cash. At the end of the first fiscal quarter, we had $2.2 million of cash on the balance sheet. For the period, net cash used in operating activities was $279,000 and $750,000 for investing activities. ', 'The investment was primarily for lab equipment for our flow services. With our anticipated revenue growth and underlying bookings strength, we remain confident that our cash on hand is sufficient to fund our operating activities.', \"In summary, echoing Ronnie's message, while there can be quarterly fluctuations, we are very confident in the underlying strength of our core business and long-term prospects for the company. We look forward to our next update call in mid-December. We would now like to open the call for your questions.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Paul Knight of Janney. Please state your question.', 'Casey Woodring', \"Hi, guys. This is actually Casey on for Paul. Are you still reiterating the 15% to 30% revenue growth guide that you gave just a few weeks ago? And, I guess, maybe to get to that that high-end 30% range, we'd see outsized revenue growth in the back half of the year. Just what's your visibility on that, if any? Thanks.\", 'Ronnie Morris', \"Yes. Thanks, Casey. So, our visibility, we're still confident about that range. And I think as we've discussed, we have good visibility into the pipeline, into the bookings, into the demand for our services. The reason we gave the range is because we don't have as good a visibility in terms of the short-term quarters, of what's going into fall into Q3, Q4 and what might get pushed into Q1 of next year. So, from that perspective, as I said many times, I think it's easier for us to predict a year from now than it is to predict a couple of quarters from now because we see the volume picking up, but it's just hard for us to know when these studies will get done precisely.\", 'Paul Knight', 'Got you. And then, maybe just one more. On the last call, you said that you had about, what was it, 12 salespeople. If you added any in the quarter maybe? And then, do you still expect to get to 18 to 20 by the end of the year?', 'Ronnie Morris', \"Yes. So, we're about 15 now and we think we're going to continue to add as we also expand internationally. So, I think, over the next one or two quarters, we'll probably get up to that 18 or 20.\", 'Paul Knight', 'Got you. Thanks, guys.', 'Ronnie Morris', 'Welcome.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Matt Hewitt of Craig-Hallum. Please state your question.', 'Lucas Baranowski', \"Yeah. This is Lucas Baranowski on for Matt Hewitt here at Craig-Hallum. Just a few questions today. First off, on the flow cytometry, it sounds like you're still kind of working to get your first deal signed there. So, maybe just anything you could tell us about how many potential customers you're talking to and maybe when you think that first deal could be signed?\", 'Ronnie Morris', \"Yeah. So, it took us pretty much the whole year to get our lab operational to be able to offer these services. We feel very confident that we have the right team in place. We have the right operations in place now to be able to offer the service, and we're actively talking to multiple different pharmaceutical companies. And we think, within the – most likely within one quarter, we should be able to – we feel confident that we're going to be able to get a study – book a study.\", 'Lucas Baranowski', \"Yeah. Thanks. That's definitely helpful. And then, once you do actually book a study, I guess how quickly would you expect to be able to start the work for that customer?\", 'David Miller', \"So, we would start the work pretty quickly depending on the specific study. But as we've mentioned many times, so the revenue for that work, we've really said it was really going to come a year from now. So, now depending on the study, they vary by the services that we are going to provide. So, there is potential that some of it could still hit later in our fiscal year 2020. But the guidance that we have generally given is that it will be about a year until you recognize that revenue, but the work starts as the patients are getting enrolled by the pharma company.\", 'Lucas Baranowski', \"Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I had.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from George Marema of Pareto Ventures. Please state your question.', 'George Marema', 'Yeah. Hi, guys. Thank for taking the call. Can you give a little color on the ex vivo business?', 'Ronnie Morris', 'Yeah, sure. So, we started developing ex vivo platform a couple of quarters ago. We think of the ex vivo platform differently than we think of the capabilities now to do clinical flow cytometry or the GLP flow cytometry. That was a heavy lift to get our labs operational.', \"The ex vivo platform is more of a work-in progress. We have a very large, well differentiated TumorBank. And we want to use that TumorBank in order to be able to do ex vivo screening. But there's a lot of different types of ex vivo platforms. And not only are there different ex vivo platforms, but different tumor types are more appropriate for certain types of platforms. So, there's the 2D screening. There is organoids, spheroids. There's a whole bunch of different types of assays within the platform.\", 'So, we have rolled out the beginnings of our platform. We have a team working on expanding the platform and we have a timeline that we think will take us about a year, maybe a little bit longer until we have a complete ex vivo platform. And I say a complete ex vivo platform to what we were describing on our previous call where we see that as being a major driver for the revenue over the long term.', \"So, right now, we are doing bookings with our product and we are recognizing revenue for the product. And we see, over the year, we're going to be adding different elements to the ex vivo platform. And as we add elements to the ex vivo platform, we'll certainly be giving updates.\", 'George Marema', 'And how is the core PDX business going?', 'Ronnie Morris', 'The core PDX business is actually very strong and we continue to grow the core PDX business at a very nice rate. I would say that most of our revenue and most of our growth still comes from the core PDX business.', 'George Marema', 'And a quick accounting question. So, I know you made some accounting changes on how you handle commissions and bonuses. So, what are the total accruals now for this quarter that was due to the change in total?', 'David Miller', 'About $250,000.', 'George Marema', 'All in. Okay. So, if you didn’t make the change, it would be $250,000 less expenses this quarter. Okay. Okay. All right, guys. thank you.', 'Operator', 'And there appear to be no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.', 'Ronnie Morris', \"Thank you. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining our quarterly conference call. We still remain very positive and excited about the future of Champions Oncology. There's a lot of interest and there's a lot of demand for what we're doing which is driving us to lighten up a little bit on this stretch for profitability. But really looking at the opportunity two, three years down the road and putting the building blocks in for us to be able to expand what we do as pharmaceutical companies and to be able to expand our reach and we're really excited about the prospects.\", \"So, stay tuned.

These throughput constraints resulted from the expansion, training, restructuring of the Company's manufacturing workforce and from process changes toward the end of fiscal year 2018, initiatives intended to ultimately increase throughput and efficiency in order to meet increased product demand over the short and long-term.

Our business is strong, and we are excited about the opportunities we see to deliver enhanced shareholder value.', 'And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tracy Smith, who will review some of the specifics regarding our third quarter financial results.', 'Tracy Smith', 'Thanks, Neil.', 'Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $17.4 million, a decrease of 24.9%, compared to net sales of $23.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 were $53.1 million, a decrease of 21.4%, compared to net sales of $67.6 million for the same period last year. The decrease in net sales from comparing the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 year-over-year is a result of a number of large orders from one customer in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018 that did not recur at the same levels in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019.', 'Net sales to this customer decreased $7.2 million and $17.3 million, respectively in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019. Consolidated net sales to all other customers increased 9.5% during the third quarter and increased 6.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2019, compared to the same period last year, excluding net sales from this one customer from all periods.', 'Turning to gross profit. Gross profit was $4.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to $7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 25.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 30.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Gross profit was $13.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to $21.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.

Additionally, our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis, which continue to be a factor putting downward pressure on our gross profit margin during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019. And as Neil noted, gross profit margin in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 continue to be negatively impacted by the unintended throughput constraints and inefficiencies, which we have been working to correct this year.', 'SG&A expenses decreased 14.9% to $5.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to $6.4 million for the same period last year.

The decrease in SG&A expenses during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared to the same periods last year was primarily the result of decreases in employee related costs, including employee incentives, share-based compensation and commissions. This can be attributed to decreased net sales in our financial results during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2019.', 'OCC recorded a net loss of $1.1 million or $0.15 per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of $438,000 or $0.06 per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.', 'OCC recorded a net loss of $5 million or $0.68 per basic and diluted share for the first nine months for fiscal 2019 compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2018.', 'Subsequent to our fiscal quarter end, we entered into a loan modification agreement with our lender to modify our credit agreement.

I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Wilkin for any additional or closing remarks.\", 'Neil Wilkin', \"Before we provide any closing remarks, I would like to ask Aaron, if we have any questions submitted by shareholders or other questions we're going to be answering today. [Technical Difficulty] We seem to be having some technical difficulties. Let's see, if we can call Aaron offline to correct them, if you’ll bear with us for a moment. [Technical Difficulty] Operator, this is Neil, one of the speakers. Aaron is redialing into the conference call, because he's having trouble with his line.\", 'Operator', 'Certainly, sir. And you are live, sir.', 'Aaron Palash', \"Thanks. Great. Hi, Neil. I'm sorry. Should we go back to that first question?\", 'Neil Wilkin', 'Yes. The last we heard, it was -- what was discernible was that I turn the call over to you.', 'Aaron Palash', \"Perfect. So, first, we did receive shareholder questions. First one is for the purpose of stock buybacks. Does the Company calculate, discuss and debate the Company's value on an ongoing basis?\", 'Neil Wilkin', \"Our Board of Directors and the management team does periodically evaluate allocating capital with the goal of achieving the highest returns for our shareholders. That includes potentially returning capital to shareholders among other options. At this time, we believe the best use of the capital that we have is to create enhanced return -- to create enhanced returns for shareholders is to continue investing and the actions we're taking to drive top line growth and capture the demand for our products that we're seeing, particularly in specialty markets, as well as focus on operating more efficiently.\", 'Aaron Palash', 'Great. What role is David Goode playing at OCC?', 'Neil Wilkin', \"So, I think, we've discussed this matter before. And, as we -- I believe we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, Mr. David is not playing any active role with OCC. Although we do believe he's an important financial investor in the Company.\", 'Aaron Palash', \"Okay, the next question. Today's press release disclosed decrease in net sales to a customer in third quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year. Rather than expressing sales to that customer in terms of change, can you disclose the Q3 sales to that customer?\", 'Neil Wilkin', \"Yes. We’ve typically never disclosed specific sales numbers of any customer. And so, we are not planning on doing it at this time. We have tried to include and have included in our SEC filings disclosures that we believe provide enough information about what's going on with this particular customer.\", 'Aaron Palash', 'Okay, next question. Does the language reduce the total aggregate amount of funds available for lending under the credit agreement from $7 million to $6,500,000 mean your revolver has been reduced?', 'Neil Wilkin', \"I'm going to let Tracy answer the question about revolver.\", 'Tracy Smith', 'Yes. There will be additional information in the 10-Q that we plan to file later today, but yes, that’s accurate. ', 'Aaron Palash', 'Next question. For how long is Pinnacle Bank suspending the current ratio?', 'Tracy Smith', \"I'll take that one. The current ratio covenant [was] [ph] suspended for the third quarter, beyond that, we're not going to speculate.\", 'Aaron Palash', 'Okay. Other than the current ratio of financial covenant, which was waived, are you in compliance with all other Pinnacle Bank covenants on the credit agreement, revolver and term loans? Did you receive any waivers in addition to the current ratio of financial covenant?', 'Tracy Smith', 'In the third quarter, there are two financial covenants required to be met. One is the total liabilities, the tangible net worth ratio for which we are in compliance; the second is the current ratio which was suspended for the third quarter.', 'Aaron Palash', 'Does OCC expect to remain compliant or expect any violations of any covenants at the end of fiscal year 2019? What actions will the Company take to show being in compliance with the Pinnacle Bank covenants at the end of the year?', 'Tracy Smith', 'We do not speculate on hypotheticals. Our balance sheet is strong. And with the recent loan modification, we are currently in compliance.', 'Aaron Palash', 'What are the calculations of all Pinnacle Bank covenants as of July 31, 2019?', 'Tracy Smith', 'That information is available in our SEC filings, both currently filed and that will be filed later today.', 'Aaron Palash', 'Do you expect that Pinnacle Bank will extend the expiration date of the revolver beyond June 30, 2020? Does OCC have contingency plans in the event that Pinnacle Bank decides not to extend the revolver’s expiration date?', 'Tracy Smith', \"Again, we won't speculate on hypotheticals. Our balance sheet is strong and we regularly evaluate all of our options with regard to financing.\", 'Aaron Palash', 'Does the increase in current liabilities and decrease in non-current liabilities in the balance sheet, provided in the press release, suggest that the revolver is now classified as a current liability? In other words, will the revolvers expire in June 30, 2020, absent an extension at a future date?', 'Tracy Smith', \"Yes. OCC's revolver was previously classified as non-current, because expiration was more than a year out. That balance sheet date is reported previously. And this quarter, we classify the revolver as current, as the current maturity date of the revolver is June 30, 2020.\", 'Aaron Palash', 'Great. And then, last question. What is the exact language of Pinnacle Bank’s total liabilities to tangible net worth covenant waiver for April 30, 2019, which has not yet been filed with the SEC?', 'We released in an SEC filing the language of the Pinnacle Bank waiver of non-compliance of the total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio covenant for the quarter ended April 30, 2019.', 'Tracy Smith', 'All the relevant information regarding the revolver and the waiver last quarter was disclosed in our SEC filings.', 'Aaron Palash', 'Great. That was the last question.', 'Neil Wilkin', 'Okay. Thank you, Aaron. And thank you all for submitting your questions.

Sir, the floor is yours.\", 'Martin Bloch', 'Thank you. As usual, I will turn the first part of this presentation to Steve Bernstein. Steve will give you the detailed update and then Stan Sloane will give you the update from his view and I will summarize some other thoughts for everybody and then open the discussion part to everyone of you. So Steve, go ahead.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Thank you, Martin, and good afternoon. For the three months ended July 31, 2019, consolidated revenue was $12.6 million, up 14% from $11 million for the prior fiscal year. The components of revenue are as follows: revenue from commercial and U.S. government satellite programs was $3.9 million compared to $5.5 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately 31% of consolidated revenue compared to approximately 50% in fiscal 2019.', 'Revenues on satellite payload contracts are recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method and are recorded only in the FEI-New York segment. Revenues from non-space U.S. government and DoD customers, which are recorded in both the FEI-New York and FEI-Zyfer segments rose to $6.7 million compared to $4.8 million in the prior fiscal year.', 'Other commercial and industrial revenues was $1.9 million compared to $700,000 in the prior fiscal year. Intersegment revenues are eliminated in consolidation. For the three months period ended July 31, 2019, the gross margin and gross margin rate both decreased over the same period in fiscal 2019. The decrease is primarily due to higher engineering costs on several current programs which relates to products that are pushing state of the art technology.', 'For the three months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018, selling and administrative costs were approximately 20% and 23% respectively of consolidated revenue. There were no accounts or type of expense that represented a significant portion of the change in expense.', 'R&D expense for the three months ended July 31, 2019 and 2018 increased to $2.3 million from $1.6 million, an increase of $700,000 and were approximately 18% and 15% of consolidated revenue. The company expects to maintain a high-level of internally funded activity relating to R&D through the balance of the current year and beyond to address new large opportunities in secured communication, command and control applications, next generation satellite payload products and additional DoD and commercial applications.', \"For the three months ended July 31, 2019, the company recorded an operating loss of $780,000 compared to an operating profit of $85,000 in the prior-year. The operating loss reflects improvements in revenue offset by both lower gross margin and increased research and development costs compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. Other income consisted primarily of investment income derived from the company's holdings of marketable securities.\", 'For the three-month period ending July 31, 2019, investment income included a $125,000 dividend from Morion. Other income included the sale of a fixed asset for gain of $50,000. This yields a pre-tax loss of approximately $570,000 compared to a pre-tax income of approximately $38,000 for the prior year. For the three months ended July 31, 2019, the company recorded a tax provision of $20,000 compared to $7,000 for the same period of fiscal 2019.', 'Consolidated net loss for the three months ended July 31, 2019 was $591,000 or $0.07 per share compared to income of $31,000 or a fraction of a cent per diluted share compared to previous year. For the period just ended, the company generated positive cash flow from operations of $153,000. Our fully funded backlog at the end of July 2019 was $35 million.', \"The company's balance sheet continues to reflect the strong working capital position of approximately $45 million as of July 31, 2019 and a current ratio of over 8.5 to 1. The company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet its operating and investing needs for the next 12 months and foreseeable future.\", 'I will turn the call back to Martin, and we look forward to your questions later.', 'Martin Bloch', 'I will turn over at this moment to Stan Sloane for his remarks. Stan, please.', 'Stan Sloane', 'Thanks, Martin. As stated in our press release, I’m very encouraged by the amount of new business activity we’re seeing. I believe on our last call we mentioned that we have over $450 million of bids outstanding. As of today, that number is around $490 million. We are seeing some delays in the awarded new space programs, but our win rates are solid and overall the new business picture is very promising.', \"Revenue was also up from Q1 of last fiscal year. We have several development programs, which we feel will have substantial production tales and in which we've made a decision to invest. I feel the short-term effect on gross margin are well working in investment, particularly since we’ve already received initial development contracts for several of these that could potentially result in $200 million plus of revenue.\", 'Overall, I believe we are making progress on improving operations with an eye to long-term growth of the business both top and bottom line. We also continue to generate positive cash flow. Martin?', 'Martin Bloch', 'Okay. I think the future we should examine a little bit the past and what happened. Over the past three years, all our customers have suffered to be a decrease in satellite business, which was our main area and to give you example an average of 33 geosynchronous satellites were both on average year-over. The past three years, the average was less than ten. So when our customers lost a lot of business that affected our -- a big portion of our backlog.', 'Second thing that happened is new technology was introduced and this is instead of getting 15 year to 20 years commercial satellite, the cheaper launch cost that are now happy to use automotive parts and expect the five-year of life in orbit. All of this has an effect on our satellite business. However, during this time we were on our intuition waiting for a miracle. We invested a lot in research and development and products which Stan has mentioned has bought our backlog for -- proposal backlog the first time in numbers which we’ve never expected to do and what Stan has mentioned is some of this programs although they are -- have a slow start, our customers have given us initial R&D fund in order to protect schedule.', \"I want to relate another effect that happened which -- that promises a great opportunity to Frequency Electronics. In July the second most significant navigational system to GPS called Galileo, which is the European GPS, failed because of ground station problems and was out the air for eight days. We’ve got forbid, what have happened to GPS we wouldn't have police, ambulances, homeland security, all of the critical factors that the DoD and in many cases effect maybe of a commercial operation as well.\", 'What this has created is a necessity for having local time available. So in case it happens you can operate for a certain amount of time before it can be repaired and you’re back on the air. This offers Frequency enormous amount of opportunity for especially the DoD market where technology of low G and good hold of our clocks is unique and we’re probably one of maybe three companies in the world that have the technology to meet that demand. I’m very encouraged that the reality is going to set in that we need to have local time and give us a great opportunity for the investment that we’ve made. So I’m -- with Stan, I’m very encouraged with the business that we are getting and with what we see forward, we can see a very profitable future. I would like at this time to turn over to question-and-answer. Please be kind enough to address the question to Steve, Stan or Martin, so we know how to answer you properly. Go ahead.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery Scott. Mr. Reiss, please press \"*\" \"1\" again, sir.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Does that work?', 'Operator', 'Yes. Your line is now open, sir.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay. Good afternoon, gentlemen.', 'Martin Bloch', 'Good afternoon.', 'Stan Sloane', 'Good afternoon.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Hi. In the press release, you talk about bookings. Could you just explain that versus when you say bids, which have gone from 450 to 490?', 'Martin Bloch', 'Just -- okay. Either me or Stan, both of us have the same answer, what happened. This is an open proposal to our customers on our type of equipment in many cases that we’re sole source and the only ones that can supply.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay.', 'Martin Bloch', 'So the way we get future business is the customer has a requirement they come to us and we write them a technical proposals and come up with a price to do it.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay. Can you give us some sense that the $490 million in bids outstanding, does it range all over the map, is it to one or two customers where you’re looking for an elephant order of 50 million to 100 million or is it 30 potential customers with smaller orders, 1 million to 5 million, how many entities or customers are you -- how many fishhooks do you have in the pond?', 'Martin Bloch', 'Okay. That’s a good question. I would say that probably the majority come from above half a dozen customers. [Indiscernible] say, Stan.', 'Steve Bernstein', \"Yes. It's a whole range from very small orders for small oscillators to big satellite programs. In terms of the total numbers, it's probably the 30-ish number of fishhooks that was the question.\", 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay. So on the last call in response to kind of a similar question, you answered that you provided the technology to about a dozen programs and in many cases we delivered the engineering models to the customers. So three months have a lapse since you’ve done that. Have you heard back from any of these customers negatively? I assume if we heard positively, we would have had a press release on firm order. But have some of these customers come back and said no or are they still thinking about it?', 'Martin Bloch', 'Well, I can tell you that there is only one customer that said no and the majority of them said yes. As a matter of fact, [indiscernible] to new business [indiscernible] $10 million in the past month -- 10.6 as Stan corrected.', 'Stan Sloane', 'That’s not the last month, that’s the quarter.', 'Martin Bloch', 'Yes, but the majority came at the very end.', 'Stan Sloane', 'Yes, we’ve also announced additional orders …', 'Martin Bloch', 'Subsequent.', 'Stan Sloane', '… subsequent to the quarter end, which is [indiscernible].', 'Martin Bloch', 'So to answer you, the majority of our customers think that we’re quite unique and are able to provide the accuracy, the reliability and what’s most important the ability to provide a clock that can operate in both space and terrestrial environment.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay. The point of all these question, I know the company does not give guidance and fair enough because how do you know when you’re going to get these orders. But you do tease us a little bit or give us information of how many fishhooks are in the pond and a broad estimate of the decision makers taking 12 to 18 months to make the decision? We are just trying to get a sense of playing the probabilities of when order flow is going to start to come in the next one, two or three quarters. I mean, that’s the [indiscernible] of these questions?', 'Stan Sloane', \"Well, we -- like I say, we announced couple of weeks ago of fairly substantial order was after the quarter end. So it's not in first quarter, but with your question about when the order flow, that’s a good start.\", 'Brett Reiss', 'Okay. You reaffirm to the August 29 wide area augmentation system order?', 'Stan Sloane', 'No, no to the VCXO contract for $8.7 million I believe was the amount press released.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Yes, some things are between $8 million to $9 million for a very unique product that were extremely suited for and there are couple more orders that we expect in the very near future. So we see it coming in and like I said, the majority of this proposal that we have of outstanding, we’ve a unique capability to supply the technology thus needed.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Yes. I don’t doubt it and I’m offended the company. Now the $8.7 million …', 'Steve Bernstein', '[Indiscernible].', 'Brett Reiss', 'Yes. Over what period of time will that be executed on?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Well as fast as we can do it. I think we have about a year and half, but we’re trying to do it faster because the faster we do it, the more we’re going to get on the next phase. So we are really focusing on how to get it done as quickly as possible.', 'Brett Reiss', 'Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I’m going to drop back in queue. I may come back, but I’m sure others have a lot of questions. Thank you.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'You’re welcome.', 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Sam Rebotsky with SER Asset Management.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Good afternoon, Stan and Martin and Steve.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Hi, Sam.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'The press release that went on on August 29, is there a -- just I assume is shift in the August quarter, is there a number in the next quarter which should be October? Is there a dollar number relative to how much that was or is that significant or insignificant?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Well, I’m not sure I understand the question.', 'Martin Bloch', 'Yes, could you -- Sam, could you repeat the question, because …', 'Sam Rebotsky', \"Yes, yes. It says Frequency Electronics has now delivered its fourth in a series of wide area augment systems to Northrop Grumman. So if we ship something to Northrop Grumman there is a dollar amount relative to this and is this part of a major contract? What kind of dollar and I assume if this that was announced August 29, so it's going to be a sale in the October quarter?\", 'Stan Sloane', 'No, we don’t disclose the details on that. The point of the press release was just to let you and everyone know that we’re delivering very critical hardware that happens to be an FAA program that provides navigation for commercial aircraft. So that was the purpose of the press release.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. So …', 'Martin Bloch', 'Yes, Sam, just to let you know the two reasons why we don’t do it. First of all, most of the cost of this programs are classified and the ones that are not classified, we don’t want to tell possible competition that what our pricing is.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'So in the backlog how many more of this thing that we ship to Grumman? Do we have a number or more of these things we’re shipping?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Yes.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. Okay. And we are not going to -- quantify the number more, I guess?', 'Stan Sloane', 'That’s correct.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay.', 'Stan Sloane', \"I will get you the two reasons why it's not wise. One, we cannot because of the sensitive nature and the second is we don’t want to quantify because I’m sure some of the possible competitors are listening.\", 'Sam Rebotsky', \"Okay. The $490 million that were bids are presumably based on the R&D that we are spending, there will be more bids. Is there -- do we see $600 million, $700 million, I mean -- the question of a number in the bids and then we spoke of a 12 to 18 months timeframe before they make decisions, if we are so fortunate to get even 50% of this, this would be astronomical. It's like extended up in the satellite. I mean, Frequency will explode. Could we handle that? What’s the story there?\", 'Stan Sloane', 'Yes. We are not going to explode. We can handle it. Obviously, when we bid jobs, we do the planning associated with production and engineering loads. So we know that we can execute it. We would not bid on something that we could not execute.', 'Martin Bloch', 'That we cannot deliver.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay.', 'Martin Bloch', '[Indiscernible] understand we do have significant other opportunities. And like I said, Sam, as I mentioned, the big area that will now be addressed is that people will recognize the importance of having their own time so they can survive in case the GPS interruption and that will open a significant, in my opinion, other opportunities to FEI.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. We had about 200 employees at the end of the last quarter. I know we are trying to hire more people. Do we have more than 200 now or where we’re on the hiring process?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Well, we are kind of taking a look on population what we have and what we need and the specialties that we need to add on.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'So do you think we need to subcontract some of this if we get big orders?', 'Stan Sloane', \"We are looking at that possibility, very good because it's -- that’s much more cost effective than adding people to the routine jobs. The assembly, anything that we can get on our side that will be our first choice.\", 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Are we looking at any companies to acquire or merge that would give us …', 'Stan Sloane', 'All the time.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Yes, yes.', 'Stan Sloane', 'All the time.', 'Sam Rebotsky', \"Yes, yes. Well, I guess you guys are trying, I’m very happy that you’re bidding on the number of dollars on the contracts. It's really wonderful and hopefully soon that somebody contracts will come to fruition and become backlog and sales, so profits will reward the stock. And -- yes, are we ready to make presentations or are we -- when we are going to start doing that?\", 'Stan Sloane', 'We are ready and we will do them.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'Okay. All right. Good luck everybody.', 'Stan Sloane', 'Thank you, Sam.', 'Sam Rebotsky', 'You’re doing wonderful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Richard Jones, Private Investor.', 'Richard Jones', 'Hi. I’m wondering in dollar terms what percentage of your business has generally been fixed price versus cost plus?', 'Stan Sloane', 'A little higher, 70 -- probably, 70-30 fixed price 30% cost at various little bit of period, but that’s roughly what it looks like.', 'Richard Jones', 'You expect it to be roughly that mix in the future?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'That’s an ideal mix for us. We don’t want too many cost plus jobs that high risk development jobs is those value to cost plus, but the others we are much more efficient on a fixed price basis.', 'Richard Jones', 'Okay. Okay. And what roughly has been your win rate over time and what do you expect for that in the future?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Win rates recently we ran about 70%, it will vary over time, but there is a delay. Range is pretty good for this kind of business.', 'Richard Jones', 'Okay.', 'Martin Bloch', '50% plus is [technical difficulty].', 'Richard Jones', 'Okay.', 'Stan Sloane', 'If you look over a long period of time. And maybe …', 'Richard Jones', 'And I guess …', 'Stan Sloane', 'And [indiscernible] that we did not win, ended up to be [indiscernible] programs. Some programs look very hot and all of a sudden the government decided that this is what they want to do. So we’ve a good rate in our technology because we don’t bid from TC to Life. We bid on areas where we’ve great expertise.', 'Richard Jones', 'Okay. Okay. I have a couple of questions for Steve. I wondered what you start really going and get profitable? What sort of combined federal and state income tax rate would you expect?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Well, we think it will go proportionally back up to where we’ve always been in 20%, 30% range, once it will -- again, once we start to show profits.', 'Richard Jones', 'Yes. Donald Trump lowered the corporate rate and the number in my head is somewhere around 21% …', 'Steve Bernstein', \"21% is the corporate rate, but then you’ve other things that play into effect. So, it's hard to say given the exact number what it will be.\", 'Richard Jones', 'Yes. So if you add in the state income tax and the other things you’re referring to, it might get up to 30% or higher?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'About 30%.', 'Richard Jones', \"Okay. Okay. There's a new line in your assets in the July 30 numbers -- 31 numbers, it's called right of use assets. Can you tell me what those are?\", 'Steve Bernstein', \"Sure. There's a new pronouncement for leases, so you look on the balance sheet for the assets and the liabilities. So for all leases were required to calculate the asset side and the liability. It was from more, they believe it's for clarity. So we’ve a right to use asset and then we also have a liability that corresponds to it both short -- current and long-term.\", 'Richard Jones', 'Okay.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'All really is the leases that we have.', 'Richard Jones', 'Those the liability on the right side of the balance sheet, should an investor think that as comparable to long-term debt?', 'Steve Bernstein', \"No, because it -- yes, you could say, yes -- no, it's not long-term debt. It's the same. Before that this pronouncement we’ve to pay rent per month, right? So now what they’re doing is they’re telling you have an asset to use the building and you’ve a liability to pay the rent. It's -- no different than it was.\", 'Richard Jones', 'Yes. I understand. Yes. Okay. Thank you.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'You’re welcome.', 'Stan Sloane', 'You’re welcome.', 'Operator', 'We will take our next question from Michael Eisner, Private Investor.', 'Michael Eisner', 'Hi. I’ve question. Did you say sold source on the $490 million?', 'Stan Sloane', 'We sold source on all of it. The answer is no. We sold source on a good portion of it, yes.', 'Michael Eisner', 'All right. Thank you. And then you said something about to bring $200 million in revenue. Was that on top of the $490 million?', 'Stan Sloane', 'I don’t know. I don’t understand the question. Can you say again, Michael.', 'Michael Eisner', 'Stan said something about $200 million and I couldn’t hear, I’m good.', 'Stan Sloane', 'Of the $490 million of outstanding bids, some of those have contracts where we’ve already won the development part and we’re doing the first part. It maybe production options later which add up to the $490 million. But about $200 million of that we’ve the initial contracts and they have production options and other things associated with them that would add up to the $200 million.', 'Michael Eisner', 'All right.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Which is a going thing, Mike, because we’ve gotten those early turn on in order to protect schedule. So if our customers have issues in getting their contract finalized with the government, they took the initiative of difficult initial development. So schedules get not too badly impacted.', 'Michael Eisner', 'All right. And Martin, you’re doing more the scientific part now.', 'Martin Bloch', 'That’s my job.', 'Michael Eisner', 'All right. That’s -- I think that’s perfect for you.', 'Martin Bloch', 'Well, thank you. I did know it was perfect for me much.', 'Michael Eisner', 'And that $8.7 million contract that you just received, how big can I get is that, I mean long-term?', 'Stan Sloane', 'That’s potentially $25 million to $30 million.', 'Michael Eisner', 'Over a couple of years?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Over several years.', 'Michael Eisner', 'The same thing. several years, couple of years. And how is the GPS IIIF coming along?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Very good.', 'Stan Sloane', 'IIIF is progressing.', 'Michael Eisner', 'That’s coming -- are you allowed to announce that if you get that?', 'Stan Sloane', 'If we get orders for that, certainly we would make that announcement.', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Well, I don’t know will they allow GPS when they get the order. We will have to get a clearance from our customers, but we will try to announce it.', 'Michael Eisner', 'And the $37 million air force contract, any color on that? How is that going?', 'Steve Bernstein', 'Its standing still. The air force is deciding which way to go.', 'Michael Eisner', 'Or its still in the [multiple speakers].', 'Martin Bloch', 'As a matter of fact we have a meeting in Washington just a few days ago, and that was one of the discussions on this, which way the air force is going to go. At this moment, its standing still.', 'Michael Eisner', \"Well, when you say which way it's going to go, do you mean [indiscernible] forward or if they’re going to do it or what you mean …\", 'Stan Sloane', \"Well, yes, that’s it.

The margin is affected …\", 'Michael Cooper', 'I think there was a comment in there that the gross margins were compressed because of new technical developments?', 'Stan Sloane', 'Yes, correct. Well that’s like margin set and we said in the press release that we are pushing state of the art technology. So that there is work we are doing [indiscernible] engineering that’s in the COGS line is also R&D, increased almost $700 million, but that’s not COGS, that’s -- I think I can give you some color on the demand involved. During the [indiscernible] we were happy to bump at town as goes on, the need was attack a house. Nowadays, we want the accuracy to put it into a window. And that’s the required [indiscernible] amount of precision on our clocks and also to make [indiscernible] comment environmental effect and that’s the development. To improve the accuracy and improve their accuracy on the dynamic environment. That’s the major investment that we’re making.', 'Michael Cooper', 'Okay. But, yes, just my confusion is around [indiscernible] as oppose to increasing your R&D line by $700,000, I would have thought you would increase your R&D line by whatever that number is, the compressed, the gross margins. I …', 'Martin Bloch', \"Well, let's make a distinction between R&D costs and developmental costs which are contract related. We have contracts that have non-recurring engineering caused for development is part of the contract. That’s totally separate from [multiple speakers] internal R&D which Steve explain the [indiscernible] on that. But those are two different things. Sometimes we spend money on internal development for products that are perhaps generic, those we get charged to internal R&D. When we are doing work on a specific contract, that’s typically charged to the contract.\", 'Michael Cooper', 'Okay. Okay. Thank you. My second question is around your news release on the [indiscernible] 6,000 and that new product line. And I was looking into that a little bit and I was reading some stuff on the U.S military is looking for and part of that I think your new product line answers their requirements for open source systems. And I think your system they are -- is open source. Can you tell me if I’m right there and is open source a new emerging trend in bidding for government contracts. And [indiscernible] open source is that on the software side.', 'Martin Bloch', 'Yes, that -- typically have [indiscernible] open sources. So the government is pushing that.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions.', \"Before we continue, I would like to remind you that the discussion today will contain certain Forward-Looking Statements. These forward-looking statements include among others, statements with respect to the Company's continued focus on building brands and growing e-commerce sales particularly Babaka branded and Acorn Fresh, its planned for continued development as Acorn Digital Services and the company's expected completion of the shutdown of its call center in the third quarter of 2019, the classification and presentation of such shutdown as well as the further increase in efficiency, reduction in cost and increase in profit from continuing operations for the year such shutdown is expected to generate among others.\", \"A number of the potential inherent risks and uncertainties that Acorn's business involves are outlined in the Company's public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Furthermore, the unaudited financial information discussed today is preliminary and subject to potential adjustments. Adjustments maybe identified when audit work has been performed for the Company's year-end audit, which could result in significant differences from this preliminary unaudited financial information.\", \"Now, I will turn the call over to Jacob Fisch, Acorn's CEO and President, who will discuss some operational highlights for the quarter. Jake.\", 'Jacob Fisch', 'Great. Thank you, Elaine. Acorn posted another quarter of solid sales growth in the second quarter of 2019 with revenues up 38.6% from the second quarter of 2018 due to continued strong performance of Babaka branded products and Acorn Fresh on our e-commerce channels with gross margin improving to 71.8%. Due to increase investment in sales and marketing to support growth of our new business, our results were just below breakeven, net operating level while net income was $100,000.', 'During the second quarter of 2019, our Babaka brand posture correction products continue to achieve record sales driven by the successful promotion of our core products through digital media in China and sell these products through third party e-commerce B2C platforms. Acorn Fresh which offers high-quality fresh food products via e-commerce continue to build momentum. During the quarter, we created a new business unit Acorn digital services under which we consolidated Acorn Entertainment our social media management business, Acorn streaming our digital content business and AKOL standing for Acorn opinion leader, which facilitates the development of local China influencers with the objective to optimize their ability to convert Acorn content into product sales.', \"Acorn digital services has been gaining momentum recently entering into new agreements with brands and influencers across a range of industries, we are excited to represent Chef Works, a global leader in culinary and hospitality apparel, serving some of the world's top hotel brands, restaurants in culinary academies to provide them with social media and digital management services to help grow and further monetize the value of their brands in China. In addition, we recently signed a high-profile Dutch media influencer to provide social media and digital management services that help establish and monetize their brand in China.\", 'We are also exploring opportunities to expand our relationship with state-owned media powerhouse, Shanghai Media Group, with a focus on content creation and licensing. On August 28, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.125 per ordinary share or $0.25 per ADS that in second quarter 2019. Our dividend policy calls for recurring quarterly dividend of $0.125 per ordinary share, or $0.25 per ADS subject to quarterly review approval and declaration by the board. ', \"Looking ahead, Acorn will continue to focus on building brands and growing e-commerce through those brands. We will focus on our principal brand including currently Babaka branded products and Acorn Fresh while also providing services to third-party brands through Acorn digital through which in certain cases, we have the opportunity to incubate new self-owned brands for the principal side of business in a risk manage manner. We're also in the process of shutting down our call center operations in Bushi, China; which are increasingly unproductive as a sales channel in China's new digital economy. \", 'We expect this will further allow us to focus our energies on digital and e-commerce, increase efficiency and lower cost and we hope to complete the process within the next few weeks. Once completed, we will be required by applicable accounting rules to treat the historical operations of the call center and discontinued operations which we believe based on our estimate will have a positive impact on our profit from continuing operations for the year. Based on our estimates and net effect of these discontinued operations in the first half of 2019 would have been the decrease revenue and gross profit by approximately $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, and improve income loss from continued operations for the first half of 2019 by approximately $0.2 million. The results for full year 2019 will include the call centers operations as discontinued operations throughout the period.

So for the second quarter, total net revenues were $8.7 million up 38.6% from $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in e-commerce sales above our branded products as well as other products. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2019 was $6.3 million up 39.9% from $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 71.8% in the second quarter of 2019, up from 71.2% in the second quarter of 2018 due primarily to a higher proportion of sales from BABA cobranded products. ', 'Total operating in the second quarter 2019 were $6.7 million up 35.5% from $5 million of the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase in selling and marketing expenses to support e-commerce sales which are partially offset by slight decrease in general and administrative expenses and an increase in other operating income due to increased revenues from Acorn digital services and interest from the loans [indiscernible]. Loss from continuing operations was $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 which is comparable to a loss of continuing operations $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2018. Other income was $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to other income of $27.7 million in the second quarter of 2018.

', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Hi, good morning, guys. Couple of questions for you. The increased expenses for marketing for this quarter is this a, can we anticipate this to be a permanent higher level of spending or is this something that was my first question, is this something that was just unusual in the quarter or can we anticipate that this will remain this way for the foreseeable future?', 'Jacob Fisch', \"To some extent the increase in expenses are correlated to the growth and some extent, there was investment in growth in other parts of the business. So part of the business is simply driven by increase in selling expenses and other parts of the businesses we required some investment. I would in terms of estimating the future I'm not going to do it from a financial perspective, but in terms of the degree of investment needed to grow the business that will continue to be managed, we have said it time and time again that we want to grow profitably and that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be investment in that growth but it's going can be managed growth. And that is key, so there may be certain periods in which we're investing more in certain periods in which we are investing less but overall, our strategy is to grow in a managed manner and ultimately to focus on profitability.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"And just sort of a follow-up. I know you mentioned you are not going to make any forward-looking predictions in terms of profitability. But I believe one of the reasons the stock is trading close to its 52-week low is just investor's uncertainty as to where the business is going. So to that extent can we anticipate that future quarters should be better than breakeven at this point?\", 'Jacob Fisch', \"Yes, again, I would stay away from making those kinds of financial projections but we are, our goal is to maintain a profitable position. Certainly, as we round out the year of that would be what we would like to be able to do. So that's about as far as I feel real comfortable, responding at this point I hope that helpful.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"And final question with the stock trading at these levels. And if one does basic math, which I think you know unfortunately lot of people don't. Is there a buyback program or as the company considered buying back the stock and if so have they brought back any stock?\", 'Jacob Fisch', \"You may know have had buyback programs in place in the past, we have and currently are continuing to assess the possibility of doing that, obviously one downside at this stage is that we would be narrowing and already fairly thin float. So that sort of the countervailing concern of putting in place, putting back in place the program, and we received comments from shareholders about the thinness of the flow being a concern. So, we're trying to balance that but at the same time we continue to consider options and continue to consider that as an option. I was just going to add. \", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"I will make a comment out for the people, to the investors that say Jesus the float is too thin, you should buyback the stock that they should be buying the stock in the open market, you can't have it both ways. We told the company not to buy the stock back, but then you and I will have to buy the stock in the open market. So, it's just my own comments. I appreciate the comments.\", 'Jacob Fisch', 'Got it, thank you very much.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Next question coming from Richard Greulich, REG Capital Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.', 'Richard Greulich', \"Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the share repurchase question. It would seem to me that given the book value and the current stock price. It's a pretty good investment and I would suggest not worrying too much about the flow that usually will take care of itself with valuation. Maybe let me phrase it in a question, why would you not be buying back stock again?\", 'Jacob Fisch', \"It's a good question. Once again we have considered the concerns that we’ve received on sort of both sides of the fence and I appreciate your rhetorical question perhaps and let's take that on board and take another look at it.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] So, there are no further questions at this time.

My favorite part of that presentation was a two to 10-year, did you see that? That was the only thing that was consistent, right? Heading downward. I'm Andy Cecere, CEO of U.S. Bank. It's my pleasure to welcome you to the 2019 Investor Day. First of all, let me thank you. I know you have a lot of pressures on your time. And I recognize that is your choice to come here this morning. And I want to thank you for that. I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to our story. And I want to thank you for the investment in our company. \", \"I believe we have a great story to tell. I believe we're positioned in an excellent pace to win in this new environment. And when I talk a little bit about what's changed over the last three years, if you think about the evolving world we're in, let me start with the economic scenario. And I'll start by telling you that we have a lot of data at the company. A lot of early indicators that we look at in the credit group, in the payments group and so forth, and none of those indications are recession upcoming.\", \"You're going to hear from Jodi and Mark a little later, that our credit staff as it relates to the consumer, commercial and corporate banking groups are all consistent and stable. From a spend standpoint, we have a lot of data there also. And as you recall, at the end of 2018, there's a little bit of a dip in spend activity, particularly on the consumer side of the equation. And as we talked about in the last two earnings calls, this starting to continue to go up. And we're seeing that stability there also, so spend is stable. \", \"And finally, if you think about loan demand, that's also very consistent. You'll hear from Terry later, but that consistency has been in place for the last couple of quarters. So our data would indicate stable, continuing growing economy. Now at the same time, as you all know, we have conflicting messages, as you think about global growth, China, trade, tariffs and Brexit. And probably most of all, what you're seeing in the yield curve and the indications about something might be happening. And that sort of conflicting set of messages is creating a lot of volatility, uncertainty in the marketplace absolutely and we have to be able to react to that on an ongoing basis.\", 'From a changing expectation standpoint, quite a lot has changed. But the one I want to focus on is individuals’ and businesses’ expectations around privacy and trust in technology. That is a fairly recent change in just the last almost 12 months that people have a heightened awareness of how their data is being used. And their protection and privacy of that data is becoming even more important to them. ', \"From a regulatory environment, we've come a long way. If you think about the last 10 years, there was a tremendous increase in regulatory oversight in the banking industry, increased capital levels, increased liquidity levels. And I will say overall the banking industry is in a much safer, better place today. Now the last three years, I would call more moderate and stable. And there's a lot of clarity and there hasn't been actually increases in regulatory oversight in the industry overall. \", \"And in fact, I would say a lot of the focus has shifted from capital and liquidity to overall reputation and operational risk. And that's an area of focus that you'll hear a little bit about more in a moment. And then finally, probably the most significant change that's occurred is related to technology and the digital revolution. The fact is our customers, U.S. Bank customers, banking customers all overall are impacted not just about what's happening in the banking industry, but what's happening in the industries across the United States. And the expectations and the way they're dealing with the bank has changed quite dramatically.\", \"If you think about 10 years ago, just about every transaction that occurred at the bank, occurred in the four walls of a branch. And today, two-thirds of transactions occur in a digital device. That's quite a change over a 10-year timeframe. And even over the last couple of years that's moved up from about 50% to 67% and it continues -- that curve continues to be very steep. And customers' expectations around convenience and speed, and certainty, and safety and privacy have also increased quite dramatically. So that means for us, that we have to rethink about the role of the branch, the number of branches and how we think about our branch network and you're going to hear a lot more about that today. \", \"And certainly, the competitive landscape has changed. You met a number of our Board of Directors. We have an annual strategic off-site that we talk to our Board every year. We've been doing that for the past 10 years, and we talk about our competitors. And for many of those 10 years, our competitors would have been those circles around the Blue U.S. Bank, principally our peer group banks. But as the Board knows, the last three years, we've expanded that quite dramatically to include the large tech platforms on the left and the fintech players on the right. Because the fact is, those are our competitors today just as much as the other banks. They are entering the financial services area -- arena, principally through payments and money movement.\", \"Banking traditionally, particularly deposit taking, and lending has a pretty wide moat around it. It's regulated business and many of the fintech players and large tech platforms are not in that. However they're entering through payments, and sometimes creating partnerships to expand beyond that. And we recognize that -- and this is one of the key things that you can hear today is that combination of payments and banking I think is as critical as it's ever been in the last few years.\", \"So a lot has changed in the environment, a lot has changed in the industry, and a lot of changed at that U.S. Bank. When you think about the last three years, we've done over 17 acquisitions, card portfolios, trust portfolios, and a lot of increased capabilities, one of which we announced earlier this week, software capabilities or payments capabilities across the board. \", \"We announced our first expansion into a new market in 10 years. Next month, we're going to go into Charlotte, North Carolina with what we're calling a digital first branch-light strategy. And Tim is going to talk a lot more about our thinking around that.\", \"Kate will talk to our brand campaign, but I will tell you that our name recognition, our brand awareness is much stronger today than it was just three years ago, and certainly six years ago. We've gone from a regional bank to a national bank, and that brand awareness is certainly out there. And finally, we've had a number of enhancements and product introductions across every customer segment in the bank and every single business line. \", \"From a flexibility standpoint, probably one of the most significant changes is exiting the consent order. We were in the AML consent order for three years. And while we were in that order, we were increasing our expense space, both from a technology and operational standpoint as well as the number of people focused on that initiative. The good news is we're passed that heightened spend. We're in the stability phase, as we sit today. And in fact, you're going to hear from Jodi, where our objective is to optimize our overall risk management function. \", 'The second important component of that, is while we were in that consent order, we were bound and could not open new branches, which really limited our flexibility in terms of closing branches, because we want to optimize the locations. As a result of exiting that, we, as you know, announced a 10% to 15% reduction in branches, and a very different face of the branches that -- rash that remains. What goes on in those four walls as I’ve talked about, and Tim will talk about more is very different today than it was just a few years ago. And that flexibility allows efficiency and effectiveness.', \"And speaking of efficiency and effectiveness, if you look at the tech side of the equation, there's a lot that’s changed there. Now we've been an innovation technology driven company in our payments group for two decades. Our Elavon Group has had Agile Studios going back to 2000, before anyone even knew what an Agile Studio was? But the fact was, it was a little bit isolated in that group. In the last 18 months, it’s been expanded to across the bank. We currently have 22 Agile Studios impacting every business line, and it has completely changed the way we develop and execute in terms of our product management and product development. \", 'It’s faster, it’s quicker to market. It’s much more customer centric and it’s much more efficient, and you’re going to hear more about that, but it’s the new way of doing business. And that 22, I would expect to expand to double in the next year. That has allowed us to introduce some of the things you see on that slide, like increased automated underwriting, instant decisioning, you’re going to hear about some of the products and the revamped mobile app. ', 'And finally, we’ve had a number of changes in the executive leadership. Probably the most recent -- certainly the most recent change is the creation of a Chief Digital Officer position, you’re going to hear from Derek White later this morning. But I believe so strongly that the digital component of our success is critical, that we created a managing level committee position, that looks across the company at all the digital initiatives and making sure we’re having this on a consistent, effective way introduced to all the clients regardless of the business line. And Derek’s going to give you the vision around that shortly. We have new leaders across HR and Risk. Tim has taken over the Combined Consumer and Business Banking Group. And Gunjan is here today -- at the last earnings call, I think Gunjan, you were on the phone, you were one month away from starting, we wanted to make sure we had a good earnings call before put her up, call us -- call before we started, but she is not here to talk about wealth management. ', 'So, a lot’s changed in the industry, a lot has changed at the Bank and I want to tell you well, how I think about where we are today. Three things, number one; I believe we’re starting from a great position of strength. I will tell you this very honestly, I wouldn’t trade places with anyone else in our peer group and I’ll tell you why, but I think we have all the attributes and the exact right timing to be really successful in this new environment.', 'Number two; those core competencies and advantages, that got us here, that got us to this point to that position of strength that I talked about continue, we’re focused on retaining those strengths. And number three; we recognize that the future is changing and we have to continue to adjust to be successful in that new future. ', 'I’d like to talk about the position that we’re securing. So you all know that we’re the fifth largest bank in the country, just over $480 billion in assets, and just over $80 billion of market cap. This is a great position to be in. Why is that? Because we’re able to spend $2.5 billion in technology and operations around innovation on an annual basis. And that’s important, because that is much more than the banks below us are spending; number one. And number two; is while the banks above us are spending more than that, we have a much simpler less complex, more straight forward business model. ', 'So why we maintain that? Our $2.5 billion is much more effectively spent in terms of outcomes and production. And we’re able to do that in this environment, moving a lot more of our projects from defense to offense. You’re going to hear a lot about that in a moment, but we’re making tremendous progress. So, when you think about M&A, coming back to that point about the industry, M&A is occurring in the industry and in payments for two reasons. Number one is, scale; and number two is, capabilities. ', \"We believe, we have the scale as I have already talked about. And importantly, we already have this great payments business, sitting in U.S. Bank and our objective is to, lead that into the banking component because of the importance of payments and banking coming together in this new environment. So, we really do have the scale and the competencies to be successful. So, we do not believe we need to do an acquisition, however it would not be prudent of us to put our head in the sand and not be aware what's going on in the market. So, we will look at opportunities as they present themselves, under the following lens, it's a long-term lens. \", \"You're going to hear about a lot of progress today, and we’ve made a lot of progress across the company and that momentum is terrific. So, as we think about deals, we recognize that there's going to be a distraction with the deal, somewhere in the neighborhood of 18 months to 2.5 years. So the question we ask is will we be a better bank after that's done three to four years from now than we would be on our own with the momentum we're making? So we're now looking at the short-term and the day one announcements or that initial financial projection. It’s the long-term positioning of the company and making sure we're in the best position possible given the momentum we have and that’s how we think about it.\", \"Now the second thing you’ll notice from this chart is we are more valuable than we are there. If you look at the left hand side, you'll see we are one fourth of the size of the bank of others in terms of asset size but if you look at the right we're more than half in terms of value. And one of the key reasons for that is our returns. From an ROE, ROA and efficiency standpoint, this chart in the last three years, we are number, one number one and number one. But if I did the last 10 years, we have the same position, number one across the board. So, function of a lot of things but I wanted -- the message to you is, is our intent to retain that position in this new environment regardless of what happens.\", \"And if you step back and look at our advantages, I'm going to classify them in four categories. I already talked about our financial discipline and our financial measurements. I would also maintain to we have a very good offense, I would also maintain we have the best defense. You're going to hear from both Terry and Mark in terms of when the road gets rougher we actually perform even better. That's true to the CCAR process, we have the least amount of capital implication. We make money even under the most severely adverse scenario. It's is true of our charge-off volatility, which is much less volatile in a harsh environment than anyone else. And important we haven't changed our stripes and our credit underwriting. So that financial discipline that risk discipline which leads to the highest debt ratings in our peer group and among the highest on the globe which is a tremendous advantage from a funding cost standpoint, a competence standpoint and a counterparty of choice standpoint. Huge opportunity, huge advantage and one that's very important to us. \", 'Secondly, our business mix. We have this great diversity of businesses that offer diversity of sources of income, about half of it, a little less than half in fees, some of it from net interest income and together they really diversify during economic cycles. And importantly unlike a number of banks, we have a number of unique business lines, corporate trusts, funds services and payments that are very capital efficient, high return scalable businesses that we have a huge advantage in, which drives the efficiencies and the returns they I just talked about. ', \"Number three, I talked about trust, confidence being so important in this environment and Kate will share with you some of the facts about how were positioned, how we're positioned very well from a trust standpoint. We've always done things for the right reasons. Our employees are highly engaged and that trust factor, which I think is even more important in this environment is one that we're starting to position the strength. \", 'And finally, our strategy which is four simple components. Number one, retaining the financial and risk management I just pointed out, trusted choice component. Number two is looking at activities across the bank just like they are across the bank. We spend very little time as a team thinking about business line by business line and really thinking about the customer at the center of everything we do. ', \"Number three and the right, I’m a big believer in this, I think we have great opportunity to continue to drive for simplicity across the company. Simplicity in the way customers deal with us and making simple for employees to do their job. And then finally, the future. We understand that things are changing rapidly. We’re not going to just sit back and say we’ve got it all in place. We don't need to change it all because we know what we're doing and we will just keep doing what we're doing. We need to adjust and we’re recognizing that.\", \"So for those of you in the audience, who have invested with us for the last 10 years, the good news is, those strengths that you’ve invested in us for, our financial discipline, our business mix, our risk management and our culture, are not going to change. Those strengths are strengths that we recognize are critically important for the future and we're not going to change our strategy. However, I believe and our team believes strongly that those are necessary but insufficient to be successful in the future under this new environment and the pivot we need to make while retaining those core competencies is to be more agile, innovative and you can hear this theme throughout the day more digitally focused across the board. \", \"So as we think about what we're investing in the future, I want to talk about this sort of balance. One of you in the room came to speak to our Board about two years ago and you said one of the things we like about U.S. Bank is that they manage the company for forever. That was a great way to say because that's exactly how we think about it. We're managing the company for the long-term. However, we recognize that while we manage the company for the long-term we need to perform in the short-term. I get that too, so I will never forget that. \", \"So this is great balance that we’re looking at, which is optimizing things we're doing today to continue to invest for the things we want to be great at tomorrow. The optimization on the left-hand side includes things like our business mix. So we've actually exited a number of businesses that either have limited competitive advantage from our perspective, are not going to be as critical in the future because they are paper-based businesses or demand a lot of investment with limited return. Businesses like retail lockbox and our ATM driving business with cash operations. And we're going to continue to look at optimizing our business mix. \", \"I talked about physical asset optimization, a great opportunity for both efficiencies and effectiveness of what's going on in the branch and we're looking at that across the board. Upper right structure, Terry will talk about this little bit more. We’re looking across the company for expense control and then labor-managing in call centers, across every area of the company we’re looking for optimization and efficiencies. \", \"And you're going to hear from Jeff on technology and risk but technology and risk is an investment for the future, but also optimization of current and Jeff is going to talk a lot about that. So we are doing all those things to optimize what we have here now in order to be successful in investing in the digital money movement capabilities as well as new markets in the future. And as we think about that future investment I think about it across three horizons. \", \"On the core business model we want to be the very best consumer and business strength, the very best wealth manager, the very best payments business in corporate and commercial bank in the industry and running that as effectively for the benefit of our customers as possible, while at the same time transforming the way we're doing that business, seeking that optimization and recognizing the technical investments that we need to make to continue going forward. And that middle category is sort of this horizon in one to three years. And all the while looking at that future, that horizon that's a little longer, little less clear, we know there are certain components that we need to have core capabilities to drive our success and have that agility and digital focus. \", \"So across those three horizons we’re focused on these five things. Number one, relentlessly focusing on the customer. Everything we do at the company is with the customer in the center and all of our capabilities around that. The way we think about product development, technology, service, operations, communications, we're looking at the customer at the core of what we do.\", \"Secondly, and your -- if you do a word count and what you're going to hear the word most today is going to be digital. I believe that digital is critical to the future of our success and being able to deliver digital capabilities in the seamless, convenient, agile, quick fashion. It’s going to critically important and we're investing heavily in that.\", \"Data; banks have always been great collectors of data and we have always been lousy users of data, right? And what we're focused on is collecting that data and using it for the benefit of the customer. You're going to hear about insights, insight to consumers around their objectives of savings goals and financial goals overall, insights to businesses, to help them improve the way they're running their business and data component combined with that digital component is critically important.\", \"Partnerships is another one. The other thing that we recognize is that we can't build everything ourselves and be everything to all customers and you're going to hear about some of the partnership today with some fintech players where they have a core capability typically in a fin unregulated slice of the capability often at frontend, combined with our balance sheet, our customer base, our underwriting and our risk discipline, together we are stronger than we are separately. And we are going to continue to focus on partnerships across the board. \", \"And then finally really this concept of one U.S. Bank, breaking down the barriers of businesses, thinking about the customers and not just the way we're dealing with customers, but internally the way we're optimizing across the company. We no longer do our investment prioritization business line by business line, we do it as a company. We do it as a one entity across the board. So that's a focus area.\", \"Now, I know a lot of you follow the company for a long time and we have always focused on those things that we can't control and we will continue to do that. I can't control the economic environment, the interest rate environment but I can control the expenses and the optimization and we’re focused on. We're passed our build on compliance, as I talked about into the optimization phase. We've increased the tax relief in 2017, allow us to increase our investment spend, which is now in the run rate and that's part of that $2.5 billion that I’ve talked about, and that we are looking for optimization across the board.\", 'Terry is going to talk about our capital investment and you are going to hear a lot about our investment overall -- capital return and our investment overall.', \"Now, one of the things I also recognize back to that balance component is, we need to continue to perform in the short-term and we are looking at the long-term. And there were a few years principally during the consent order process that we were not able to deliver positive operating leverage. I know that's important to you. It’s important to me and our management team.\", \"However, in seven of the past eight quarters, we did deliver positive operating leverage, for all the reasons I talked about. And on the second quarter call, we talked about it a few times our objective was to achieve it in the range of 100 to 150 basis points for the year. Now since then as you know, rates have come down and the rate scenario has changed dramatically. And so our while our intent is to continue to achieve positive operating leverage and to continue to have low single-digit expense growth, it's likely that we will be somewhat below that 1% positive operating leverage in 2019 but still delivering positive operations. If we did the things that we -- or cause us to get to that level, it would not be prudent for the long-term and we want to manage this company for the long-term and that's how we're thinking about it.\", \"So, as we think about how all this adds up and I'm going to short cut a slide that Terry is going to give you because this is so important, is whatever the environment is, whatever the interest rate, the credit environment is in the long-term it’s our intent to continue to return 14.5% to 17.5% ROE to our shareholders. We believe we have the business mix, the disciplines, the strength, the core capabilities to do that on a consistent basis over the long-term and that is our intent and Terry will talk more about the details about that in a moment. And that translates into intangible return on equity somewhere between 18% and 20%.\", \"So, I believe we're in a great spot. I believe we have the great -- the core capabilities, the strengths that have gotten us there, and we're going to continue to maintain them. But we're going to build from that success, given the future and what's important in the long-term in order to be successful over the next three, five and 10 years, and that's the why we think about the company. \", \"So what are you going to hear about today? We're going to split the discussion a little bit in terms of broad initiatives across the company, business line updates, and then talking about our risk and financial discipline at end. So at the beginning you're going to hear Kate talk about brand and culture and how important that is to our success and our unique position in that regard. You're going to hear Jeff von Gillern talk about our technology group, and he's going to talk about both from the perspective of offense as well as defense. And we have a great position on that on both sides. \", \"And then we're going to wrap up the morning part of this -- the first part of the morning with Derek talking about our digital strategy. So again, thank you for your time and attention. And I'm really excited about the story we're going to tell you and we're going to kick it off with Kate Quinn, our Chief Administrative Officer who's been with the company six years. Kate?\", 'Kate Quinn', 'Good morning. Brand and culture are differentiators for U.S. Bank and they are fundamental to how we run our business. When we met last year in 2016, we talked about how strong brands drive better shareholder return, they also drive higher top-line growth, and they outperform the S&P 500.', \"I'll tell you today, what we've done on our brand journey since then, where we're positioned and what's next for us. So increasingly, people are not just buying what you do, they're buying, why you do it. So when we began our brand journey, we started from the inside out. We started with our culture, which is a unique combination of IQ and EQ. And that is reflected in our purpose statement “We invest our hearts and minds to power human potential.” \", \"The trend of culture is very important. So when you think about the sea of black and white banking, this gray space is really, really important, the space of brand and culture. It unifies and rallies employees and it's why it’s felt across all of our stakeholders. The intersection of brand and culture is differentiating. And it is really the unwritten rule set in which all decisions are made inside the company and where it’s felt to all of our stakeholders again, and it's how we conduct the business.\", \"We were at a leadership off-site this past summer, and we asked our top 200 leaders, what is the secret sauce of U.S. Bank? And this is the word cloud that emerged from that. So for those of us who live and breathe it every day, it's no surprise that ethics, trust and collaboration rose to the top.\", \"As I mentioned that why it’s felt across all of our stakeholder groups. For employees, it is -- our purpose is motivating for them and we hear it all the time and there's a reason why we attract and retain top talent across the company. For our customers, they feel it in all of our efforts to earn their trust. And in fact when we have proof points, when we test products and services, we test marketing messages, we test everything, ethics and trust rises to the number one spot for all customer segments, both consumers and businesses.\", \"In terms of communities, we have an industry leading reputation with our community partners and again it isn't because necessarily of what we do, but how and why we engage with them. And lastly, you all feel it as well and our other shareholders. It’s felt in our best-in-class returns, our focus on the long-term and our consistent performance of course. \", \"So we also know that expectations are definitely changing. So all stakeholders are now really expecting brands to have a voice on social issues. In fact, 92% of millennials want to work for and believe it's important to work for a company that has a social conscience. We hear from all of our stakeholders internally and externally. \", \"We also know that this heightened set of expectations is not just important to our customers and employees, but it's also important to you, we hear the question from you as well. So when we think about our social responsibility strategy and our focus, we've always been good at it, but we're getting even stronger at it. And we're focused in three areas. \", \"First, making sure that what we do has social impact. And the examples of this are things like enabling access to capital, financial wellness programs. Secondly, we'll focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. This is a critical focus area for us. And lastly, making sure that we're doing our part to address environmental challenges, and we do that through our products and services, through our partnerships, but also through accountability and governance around these issues. So we will make sure to keep you posted as we evolve the strategy. \", \"So you can probably tell when we started our brand launch, we were not focused on advertising. We were really focused on telling, capturing and telling our story in a better, more integrated and consistent way across all of our stakeholder groups, internally and externally, digitally and socially. And we also -- as Andy mentioned, we've really changed our focus from thinking about ourselves and presenting ourselves as a regional brand to presenting ourselves as a national brand. \", \"And of course, being a bank, we measure everything we do. And so we know that we have had strong impact. As expected, our brand awareness in U.S. Bank has increased over these past few years. We've also strengthened our most trusted choice positioning. We've an undeniable positive impact on revenue, and deposit share. And lastly, we've also increased our, what we call central customers, which are customers that have a deeper relationship with the bank. They're more engaged and more involved with us and you'll hear about centrality throughout the deck.\", \"So brand finance recognizes that we've increased our brand by 55% over the past three years, and lots of other brands also recognize our performance from an external perspective, so for example, Ethisphere, Fortune, Forbes, DiversityInc. In terms of our reputation with community partners, I’ve mentioned this before, but we have the strongest reputation amongst all banks with community partners. And again this is because of how we engage with them, and how we commit to our success and their success within our communities. \", 'In terms of employee engagement, we historically have industry and company leading employee engagement scores. And we know that companies with highly engaged workforces outperform their peers by nearly a 150%. Focusing on culture is good business. ', 'And when we think about how do we translate that employee engagement and our brand to growth, it’s a very simple equation; higher employee engagement leads to a stronger customer experience, which leads to revenue, retention and growth. So, when we think about our employees and our customers, we think about them in a very similar way. This is all leveraged with data, analytics and insights that help us focus knowing exactly what to spend time on. ', 'So, we work on attracting, retaining and developing our relationship with both employees and the customers. And we focus on three things; one, creating compelling journeys for them both. For example, personalizing their experiences with us. Secondly; enhancing and enabling the digital lives. As Andy said, you’ll hear the word digital throughout the deck. And lastly; by establishing really deep and meaningful relationships with both. This helps us build our customer brand as well as our employee brand, resulting again in revenue, retention and growth. ', 'Trust remains a competitive advantage for us. It is not going anywhere. It is going to be a foundational driver, top driver of business in our industry. As the world evolves, we will remain competitive. We will stay relevant with our brand and we’ll focus on the moments that matter to our employees and our customers. ', 'We will continue to drive impact to our social strategies, and we will build trust at moments that matter most. We will tell our story through our brand campaigns, but really our employees are our best brand ambassadors. Let me just give you one example of that. In Northern California, during the wildfires many employees and customers lost their homes. We were unable to open our branch. We have a branch manager named Taylor, and Taylor opened up his home to employees that had lost their homes, invited them to stay with him, live with him. And from his home, he reached out to customers to make sure that they were safe, that they had what they needed during the crisis. This is a great example of our unique culture, and how that impacts our customers in a positive way. ', 'Brand helps a common agent that changes the bank. It supports some of the most critical initiative, and the growth engagement as well as revenue. It is a core competency for us and it is foundational to how we conduct our business every day. It’s also foundational to the story that you will hear for the rest of the day. Brand and culture will remain differentiators for us, to our business growth and success. Thank you. ', 'Andy Cecere', \"Thanks, Kate. And Taylor is one of my heroes, I called them after that fire, and he said, you know, what we're going to do Andy, we are going to roast marshmallows. He was just -- he has got the best attitude at those things. So, just a great example of the employee base that we have.\", 'So, we are going to go from sort of the soft gray as you talked about Kate, but important components to 011. So, we are going to go off the other side of your brain here for a minute and talk about technology and operations.', \"This is important to our company for a number reasons, but it's important for both the core, as I talked about as well as the future. Jeff has been leading this group for 20 years. He has done a tremendous job and I think we have the best technology group of banking and the best way to do it. Jeff?\", 'Jeff von Gillern', \"Thank you, Andy. Well, good morning, everyone. Technology is the backbone. It’s helping enable to drive efficiency, productivity and growth for us. And as Andy talked about, I'm going to focus on today, we've increased our level of investment in the technology area at about $2.5 billion and that's in the run rate now. But I think what's more important and hopefully I demonstrate to you today is, how we're shifting the spend in that category.\", \"We talked about offense and defense and we do our capital allocation, our investment allocation, we categorize against that. We also track all of our employee, time against that. So, it’s something we're very focused on and you are continuing to see the size of the pie related to offense, which is driving productivity and growth to get more investment than defense and part of that is coming off of the large compliance work that we did.\", \"And in the category of defense, there is also some really good things that were done with the investments that were made for AML and KYC, because that's a very data ecosystem driven environment. And so those investments at that time, we may categories as it defense, you are going to see while we're leveraging those investments because of the way that we are landing all of our transactional data in one place, we're going to be leveraging that quite significantly and applying AI and so forth to it. So, that's an example of defense spend that's going to be optimized in the future for offense. \", \"And I think the other thing that's really important is, you look below that $2.5 billion, these are a lot of technologies on the left side and I'm going to talk about today and we look at these as tools not solutions and it’s how you activate these and empower these things for business impact. It's important. But we run a big operation. We have a constant focus on the run side and the maintenance of that and these new capabilities are going to allow us for every dollar we can take out of the run and the maintain side, we can reinvest.\", \"So, when you think about that $2.5 billion, that's not just spending more, that's focused shift to offense, it’s being prudent in defense, because I would say that the security space is still continuing to get its fair share of investment and probably will continue to do that, but it’s how we are spending and I'm going to take you through a little bit how these technologies are going to allow us to optimize internally and to do some shifts in how we operate. Today, as you heard digital is a big thing and we are going to introduce a term here today called above-the-glass and below-the-glasses, as we talk about things today.\", \"I'll touch briefly on it. Derek is going to focus more on the above-the-glass. I'm going to spend more time on the below-the-glass and the optimization and the speed of the organizational things that we're focused on there. But, just simply put, it's not just a focus on our customers and consumers and how they interface with us in a digital world and how we make it simple for them intuitive, tailored, customized, but it's also important for our employees and we have an equal focus on making sure that the employees tools and capabilities are there to serve our customers as well. So that above-the-glass experience you'll see in our branches as well, as our branch folks deal with customers as they come in and help to educate them and train them on the digital space.\", \"The below-the-glass is really important and I'm going to spend more time on that, because that's where we've got tremendous opportunities to move faster, have more agility in the organization that's changing the way that we work. But it's also using technology tools differently. And in a prudent way, leveraging the cloud, which is a real key asset. I'm going to talk more about that there's a lot of focus on the cloud. And we've been keenly focused on that for the last two years. And I'll talk about the implications of that in our plans.\", \"Probably one of the more powerful things are what are called Application Programming Interfaces or APIs. And these are just -- they enable rapid access to data. And when you have many applications like a lot of banks do, it allows easy intuitive access to programs that already exist, drives efficiency, allows us to build things one time and reuse it many times. And so, you're going to hear a lot more about APIs. In fact, if you were to look at our investment level in micro services and API, that's going to be a key enabler that's going to allow us to pull efficiency out of the core systems and have less dependency on those core systems. And that's an expense play, but it's also a cycle time play. And it's an efficiency for testing and software development that I'm going to talk a little bit more about today.\", \"As you think about below-the-glass, we kind of keep it simple and think about it in three categories. It's our architecture. And we've had a very disciplined approach through our acquisitions in the past that we integrate. We moved to single platforms. I'm a big, big believer in having limited complexity in the operation we have to the extent we can. The way that we can limit complexity is not only a cost save, but it also allows our change rates to get faster. So that single platform -- disciplined single platform architecture has been very important for us, pays dividends for us long-term. \", \"The other area is data. And you are going to hear a lot about data today. I'm going to talk about it but you'll hear it in a lot of other things. We have a tremendous amount of data, and we're not using it to our best advantage. We have plans to scale that up. When we were here three years ago, if I were to look back and look at where we are now we've added hundreds of people in this space, we’ve brought in tremendous new leadership. And I'll talk more about that. But this is a key focus for us. I'm going to give you some examples of where we're already using it. And it's making a big impact. \", \"And then Andy talked about, we just have to change the way that we work. And that's not just in the technology group, but as a collective group, putting the customer at the center. We've done a lot of changes, you heard about the Agile Studios, where everybody's coming together. And we're co-developing together with the customer in the center of it. And that's going to continue to evolve and continue to expand across the bank.\", \"APIs and micro services are really important. And what we want to do here is we want to build these micro services. And we're doing this at a rapid rate to allow reuse of the technology and the code. And it's going to make us much more efficient. We track how fast we can code and test. In the fourth quarter last year, because of all the automation that's coming through some of these new capabilities we were able do some optimization in the workforce in the neighborhood of several hundred people, as a result of testing automation being built into the development process. And the reason that's important is not just for productivity and cost saves, but that automation is what it's told to do every time and it produces evidence and results that our auditors and our regulators are comfortable with. But it also drives a lot of efficiency. And we're excited about the continued opportunities there. \", \"Those are things within that $2.5 billion that every dollar that we can get more efficient with, we can self-funds. And so that's a big, big focus of our Group is how do we self-fund not just go ask for more, more money. These types of technologies are very key to that.\", \"We talked just a little bit about monetization. When I say monetization, it's enabling optimization. I'll use the mobile app, for example. That's the last just launched that we just had. And we’ve rebuilt that completely from the ground up. It's a completely advanced new tech stack, highly automated from build, the test, the deploy process. We did all that from start to finish in eight months for the Apple platform and because of the efficiencies that we’re in Android rolled out four months later. So that's an example of a highly automated, highly collaborative collective group with the customer in center, risk management at the table, security at the table, built in product that launched that’s had great, great results. While we did it with fewer people that it took to do our last mobile upgrade, we did it twice as fast and we have opportunities to continue to get better at that. You can see some of the examples here of code test time from weeks to hours and so forth, so major productivity gains in this space. \", \"We talked about data and we've got a tremendous amount of data. We need to use the data better; we need to unlock that data, so our employees can use it in their business lines in running their businesses. We use it for defense around fraud; we have lot of commercial fraud tools that we use and we’re using data and AI on the backside of that to continue to drive down fraud losses in an efficient manner. We use it in the security space and I will talk more about that specifically a little bit but the security environment is data-driven, it's all about data. It's about finding a needle in the haystack at machine speed, it’s critical.\", \"And I mentioned three years ago when we were here, we’ve continually scaled this group up, so as I said several hundred people dedicated to this now, new leadership that’s coming, it's very talented and we're really going to make a big push on this. When we did all of the AML KYC work we had to centralize and land all of our transaction data at one place and the funding for that was paid for it at the time and we need to now better advance that and better leverage but we've got the building blocks and the foundation there to do that with and we got the people and the leadership to put the focus on it. It’s a tremendous opportunity for us. \", \"This is an example of it that’s real, that occur with our mobile app rollout and this is an example of where we’re customizing and bringing tailored experiences to the user based on access to real-time data and artificial intelligence. And the beauty of this, you can send out generic tips to customers that don't feel personal, this is personal and this has caused us to get some of the most positive feedback on the mobile app release but better than the positive feedback is the engagement and the usage. If you look at our usage rates and Tim is going to talk about this in more detail, our customers on a daily basis are using the app more. That's because they're finding value and that's what we want, we want to drive engagement, we want to drive more volume on that app and obviously we want to continue to build feature function to be able to sell and to be able to do self-service there, Tim will talk more about that. But these are examples of that real-life capability with the mobile app, real-time access to data, artificial intelligence, this tailoring where it’s presenting to our customers and it's been a very positive thing. \", \"Andy talked about the Experience Studios. We're changing the way we work in a lot of different areas of the bank and the Experience Studios -- we will double those. We are planning to go from 22 to double it to 44, but the employees that work in those studios don't ever want to go back to the old way of work, and which is really kind of neat and it's -- you go in those studios, you will see more about this a little bit based on -- I want to give you my perspective and observation on it. You can't tell who works for who and it's kind of neat and some of it you got vendors in there, you got customers in there in the middle of it, but it's a collective team. And the other thing we've done is we’ve kept management out of there. We’ve let the people that know what they're doing do the job and make the decisions and resolve issues without having to do a whole bunch of escalation. So it's been positive. And I think we’ve got tremendous upside as we continue to expand this across the rest of the company. \", \"Let me talk about cloud for just a little bit because there has been a lot of press and coverage on the cloud. We’ve been on a journey over the last two years, we run two highly efficient scalable data centers in North America, and we've been going private cloud in those data centers. And that just means highly virtualized hyper-converged, those are all those are the practices you would have in a public cloud. So we've been doing that in our internal data centers. We're now building all new applications, it's a tenant we have, that it has to be public cloud-ready. Our first large payment business gateway will go live in the cloud that will be our next one at the end of this month. So all new build is being built with cloud principles for cloud public. \", \"In addition to that, we're going across the application base and we do what's called a suitability study for applications that lend themselves well to the public cloud. We will identify those and we'll re-factor those and move those but there's also an equal path, let’s say we want to sunset some of these things and we want to get rid of them. The cloud has tremendous value from a standpoint of financial economics. We have a lot of vendor products that we use today but there's open source capabilities that are much, much cheaper. The investment is ongoing in the cloud, that's where the new tools are, that's where the collaboration is, that's where the productivity is. And so we're very focused on it. But at the same time, we recognize anything we do has to be secure. And at the end of the day, if we're going to put our business in somebody else's house, we have to be accountable for the security of that. And to be accountable for the security of that you've got to understand and guarantee that you understand what's going on in that cloud and that's a key focus for us. If we don't get that right, we have a trust and a reputation impact and we take that extremely seriously.\", \"On the topic of security, key focus for us, this is an area where we have tremendous information sharing amongst the banks, but it's becoming more automated. The feeds we get through FSI stack and all the banks feed into the vectors go into that 5 billion data elements a day that we look at and we make decisions on that machine speed and we’re looking for that needle in the haystack. And on a typical day against that volume of activity we will have between 10 and 14 type of events that we need to have a human look at, decide to make a change to and so forth. But in parallel with automation and orchestration, we're continuing to drive automated actions at a sub second basis that we're comfortable with. And our automation penetration is about 20%. We have a goal to get that up to the 40% to 50%. What that means is, we know enough about what's happened with a particular event. We're going to go ahead and through automation take action on that and then we're going to make the security operation center where what occurred from an automation standpoint and that's the only way that we're going to be able to keep up with the pace of activity and attacks and things that are going on. So it’s a key focus for us. And although I put this in the defense category, this is probably the larger of the expense growth areas of -- an area I will perceive.\", \"So, just in conclusion, there's going to be an impact of the way that we're changing the way we work both from a speed and agility standpoint, but we want to be anticipatory of customer needs and stay in front of those. We want our development processes to continue to be fast. And I’ll tell you, just in conclusion, we are laser-focused on efficiency, productivity, and growth. Thank you.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Thank you. Things that I recognized early on in my role as CEO is that all these digital initiatives we have going on across the company, I think would be better controlled and maximized for effectiveness and efficiency if they were under one leader across the company because we're really dealing with customers that segment across all the businesses. So we spend a fair bit of time identifying the role and finding the right person. And Derek White, who joined us from a European industry-leading bank in the digital front, joined us just a three months ago. He has made a big change already. Derek, come up and talk about our digital experiences.\", 'Derek White', \"Thank you, Andy. It’s a privilege to be with you here today. It's a privilege to be a part of U.S. Bank and a true privilege to be part of this leadership team.\", \"At U.S. Bank, we power human potential. Now, I love that statement and you've heard from Kate that it is the very ethos in which the company operates. It is one of the things that attracted me to the company. But let me tell you -- before I get started, I'd like to touch on the three things that really drove my decision to join U.S. Bank.\", \"The first is that, we're the number-one rated bank in the world and I don't need to explain to you the impact of what that does for us financially and how it positions us for growth. But what it was to me was a signal of when we describe and use the word excellent, what is the ambition and what is the benchmark for excellent? Because that comes to the second point, in the interview process, I was able to meet with the management team and sitting across the table from Andy and we were discussing of the future of the company, he said, “Derek, we are excellent at finance. We are excellent at credit risk management. We have the ambition to be excellent at digital.” And so, when Andy informed me that we are creating the Chief Digital Officer role, which is the third reason I chose to join U.S. Bank. The creation of this role and the opportunity to work with this leadership team, to create the future of U.S. Bank for our customers, our clients and our employees was incredibly attractive. \", \"Now there are three teams that align into the Chief Digital Officer team. Those three teams are the omni-channel team that which is responsible for essentially all of the interaction platforms, you’ll hear the term interaction the lot today. The interaction platforms is the how our human customers are interacting with their money through our platforms and that is the team that is defining what we're going to create. The agile team is responsible for the studios that you heard reference and changing the how we take ideas, align them in the hands of our customers at speed and at scale. And the third is the innovation team, that's asking the question where next and why not?\", \"Now one of the great strengths of U.S. Bank is our deep customer relationships. In order for us to become central, which Tim will elaborate on more and the definition of centrality, we know that we need to be digital-first, create exceptional experiences and move at speed. One of the privileges of working in banking is that in institutional banking we get exposure to every industry, every sector. We get to sit at the table with the leaders that are shaping every industry. And as I sit with Leslie and Jim and across the table from some of these leading clients, their key messages that emerge, every single one of their businesses, their industries is being disruptive and transformed and they're addressing the same questions about digital agile and their future. How do they capture the future in a way that responds to the way their customers are interacting with technology and their product? It's about humans and human interaction with technology, human interaction with technology and products and/or services. In our industry it’s about humans interacting with money. \", 'We see that across the billions of interactions that we have with our customers. Billions of interactions become through all of our channels. Ray Kurzweil, one of the greatest inventors of our time had said that the impact of AI comes to life when you deal with billions. That’s how we bring the technology into power of artificial intelligence, machine learning to life through the billions of interactions that we have with our customers. ', 'Now this is important because of traffic. In the early ‘90s in the digital world, the early ‘90s was all about eye bolts, it was about impressions in the digital marketing world, and it was about clicks. In our world, in banking, it’s the shift of the traffic from the physical brick world to the digital world. And that started to move from brick to glass, and the glass that we all carry around with us every day to increasingly to the air and how humans are interacting hands free with computer built in the car, and the battle of the home through the Echo, the portal, the pod. ', 'Big tech is trying to attack in the same way, because the dimension of this, in banking, the average human, customer or singular branch, 10 times a year, it’s the glass or a mobile banking application, 300 times a year. They are visiting digital ecosystems 3,000 times a year, and these digital ecosystems have three goals in mind; the big tech, Andy talked about where the source of our competition, the threat and the opportunities for us are, one of those is the big tech. ', 'Big techs have three goals in mind, One; to steal the billions of uses, two; to increase the amount of interactions and time so you spend on their platform. Reed Hastings has said that their competition is sleep. The third thing they then do, is seek to monetize. They happen to take that model and contrast that against how banking starts. Why is this relevant? In a conversation with a chief executive and one of these big ecosystems of who you would all know, he described their number one KPI centers on their second priority, which is increasing interactions and engagements on their platform, and their number one KPI is messages sent. ', 'In order to understand the future of banking and how humans are interacting with technology, the traffic has shifted at a rate of 30 times the number of interactions in physical versus digital. We have to look at the business in an entirely different way, and I would suggest to you that the leading indicator for the future of banking is interactions. So, with that as context, what are we doing to translate these learnings that we see across every industry, across financial institutional clients and how we listen and see how our customers are interacting with their money through U.S. Bank? It comes to a simple model of 4, 2, 3, 1. And yes, I do know how to count backwards. And yes, you may be surprised Andy even hired me. Even how I did this? Anyway, 4,3,2,1, it’s about four humans of banking and we over-indexed on humans, because in banking many times institutions will talk about the customer as a product. They are in the digital world, this is so essential to understand that we design around the human user, because in the -- in digital, customers can navigate increasingly by themselves. ', \"The four humans are: Me, my money, which the consumer. The second is a small business owner that blends my money and my company's money. The third is the institutional employee, whether it's a treasurer in a large multinational corporate, or someone sitting at family office, that is managing money making decisions about money, interacting with money on behalf of their employer, or my employer. The fourth human is the U.S. Bank employee that is supporting and enabling other three humans that are interacting with money. \", \"Now those four humans interact with money in only one or two ways. And this is where digital becomes very tangible, real 1s and zeros. And that is, you can -- those humans interact, either in a DIY world, do-it-yourself world, or in a shared glass experience. DIY is the ability and this principle is so simple, it's not self-service. It is the ability to do it yourself in the mobile device, without having to talk to a human if you don't want to. And it's the first step of digital evolution for anything. The principle of DIY or a shared glass experience, where we bring data to life and increase transparency through a shared glass experience with our customers, as they enter our branches. \", 'Now why is this model important and relevant, especially for today in this audience? DIY is a 20% cost to income ratio or efficiency model business. Shared glass experiences -- shared experiences are 60% cost to income, or efficiency model business. DIY has higher customer satisfaction, higher revenues, lower costs. ', \"Four humans interact with technology and money in two ways. There are three ways for organizations, any company that Leslie's and Jim's clients can measure it, as well as banks can measure it. The first is, is digital available? When we say digital first, is it available, are the 50 reasons that I would leave my home and walk into a branch, spend the time to physically walk into a brick, into a brick branch? Is it available for me to do that? In our mobile banking application, you can do 74% of the things that you wouldn't take the time to walk into a physical branch to do. It's very tangible. It's very measurable. \", \"The consumer business is more mature than the institutional businesses, natural across our industry. But the same principle applies across every business we have. Once it is available it helps me to do it by myself, then can I make smarter decisions? And is the data -- as has been tossed by Jeff and Andy, are we using the data to bring it back through the glass to the customer that is in a DIY experience? Because in banking, see, over the last seven years there's been a lot of discussion about data-light and capturing the data that comes in through every interaction, cleaning the data and parking in a beautiful pristine lake as it’s safe and secure. But the real secret in the digital world is bringing that data back out of the lake through the glass into the experience and measuring every one of these billions of interactions that we have, are we using the data? Because when we use the data and it’s a smart interaction, I make smarter decisions. \", \"Now the third phase is this where it's really fun, is autonomy. One of the industries in which we work is the automotive industry and in the automotive industry they define five levels of autonomy. The Tesla today is somewhere between the level 2, level 3 autonomy and it can easily be described as feed on, hands on and mind on. Now feed off has been around for a very long time in the automotive industry. Hands-off has been around for less time. If you’ve ever spent an hour going a 150 miles an hour on the Autobahn, hands-off, your mind is shattered. This is relevant because building trust in the digital world is about enabling and using our data to help people make decisions themselves but also how do you build trust to the point where we can build a self driven bank account and they will trust us to guide them to their destination. \", \"Four humans, two interaction models, three key ways to measure digital maturity and building digital trust in the future. All comes to the simplicity of the U.S. Bank model, the focus that we have on being and creating number one amazing experiences as our leading indicator for our future. This translates -- we're translating this into five priorities for us as the digital team working with each of the businesses that we have and you will hear it from later today. \", 'Our business leaders know what our customers want and how we make money, we stick with them. We identify how do we collectively create the future together by; one, DIYing the future for all four humans; two, creating smart interactions; three, ensuring that we have the data below the glass that we can bring through the glass back to the customer that the architectures clean, simple, reusable, micro services and API because the 400 things that a human wants to do above the glass translates into 900 plus micro services below the glass, very tangible, very measurable, very real.', \"Now the one area that I would like to just expand on a little bit that's been touched on as well is the speed and scale at which we are creating the future and that’s in the studios that we have. The Agile Studios where we’ve been at it for 18 months, we have core teams that are creating the future in these studios but the Agile has expanded beyond these studios broader into the organization. We're collaborating across every part of the organization. One of the biggest surprises to me having worked in other organizations that are agile is that risk is sitting at the table embedded in every single one of these studios and helping us shape and design the future rather than sitting and watching from the outside trying to control and it’s incredibly, incredibly powerful. That’s changed the rhythm at which we create the years to months. \", \"Now just two examples to bring this to life, chosen two institutional examples, you will hear several examples throughout the day, and again, there are some examples outside the door. The first is in our corporate banking space where we are helping Jim and Leslie's clients to be able to help their customers choose how they receive payment, choose how they receive reimbursement. It's a -- the clients had three challenges in mind. One is that, they're dealing with paper cheques; two is that they did not want to disrupt their client experience. They wanted a seamless enrollment process; and three, they didn't want to store customer data. \", \"So we created experience that addresses a $1 trillion opportunity. It's designed around the client in mind and is live in the market today, giving our clients the opportunity for their brand to be present through the entire payments process and their end customers to choose how they receive payment.\", \"The second example is, what in the digital world would be described as a killer app. This killer app, it was created five years ago and is now dominant 50% market share and it is Pivot and we've recently introduced the first mobile version of Pivot and brought in the power of data to life to allow our end-users to be able to use Tableau and data visualization to help them make better decisions. There are many, many more examples of this across the business. \", \"But in summary, our digital initiatives span across the organization. We're working on designing the future around the four humans of banking. We're doing it above-the-glass and below-the-glass in very a connected and coherent way. We're moving at speed and at scale to translate ideas into the hands of our customers at the speed of technology company. We're realizing the benefits and customer satisfaction and revenues and in expenses. \", \"Digital and DIY are the basic table states. The real power comes to life as we use our data as we make our billions of interactions with our customer, smart and increasingly autonomous, and this is a long game and we're in it for the long-term. Thank you all very much.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Thanks Derek. I apology if you hear word digital a few times this morning. So, we're going to take a 15 minute break now and then after break we will go to the business plan updates. I would encourage you, you can hear about the digital applications and our products and services, outside in the foyer we have actual examples with some hosts there who will take you through those technical experiences. So I really encourage you to do that. And for those on the webcast we will reconvene at 10:00 O'clock Eastern Time. Thank you.\", \"Alright. It's 10 O'clock and we will get started. So, I'll kick off the day talking about the three things that I mentioned. We're starting for a position of strength, the core competencies that got us here we're going to continue focus on and we're going to continue to invest in the future. The next four presentations are going to take those core messages and really transform them in how we're thinking about them from a business plan standpoint. How we're both optimizing today as well as investing for the future.\", 'And we are going to start with Gunjan Kedia who has been with us for three years and he is at wealth management and investment services group and a great example of both transforming our dealing with the customers in this new environment and also unique set of businesses. Gunjan?', 'Gunjan Kedia', \"Thank you, Andy. Good morning. It's my pleasure to present the wealth management and investment services business this morning. This division is about 13% of revenues of U.S. Bank, 21% of the fees, 21% of deposits. The division is really a collection of three large businesses, all of them focused on the investment part of the financial institution. A third of it is wealth management and two-thirds of it is investment services and corporate trust being the larger of the two businesses. You will see on the bottom right, we are 61% of the revenues of fee income, so these are very capital efficient businesses. On the right hand side the number that I'd like point out is the ROA, 6 plus percent ROA across all of these business. So very capital efficient, very high fee growth businesses. \", 'Some financial highlights, we have grown revenue about 7% to 7.3% over the last three years. The loan growth story has been very, very strong, I’ll describe that a little bit, it was a big part of our strategy in wealth management and we are a very strong deposit gatherer, 5% increase in deposits, kind of industry leading efforts here.', 'The underpinning of all of these business is really global financial assets. Now that is slightly different from many other banking businesses that we have, that are propelled by metrics like population growth, or GDP growth or consumer strength. So the financial assets, when they deepen, even if it’s in APAC where we are not present, helps us in the U.S., because U.S. managers invest, U.S. investors invest globally. And financial markets have been over the last 30 years steadily deepening, as economies mature. One metric is that financial assets have grown at about 2 to 2.5 times GDP. ', 'In the times when we were showing you we have grown between 8% to 9%, the asset pools itself have grown about 4% and 5% and now our performance comes one, because we’re concentrated in the U.S. that have done better than the globe, and also market share gains. So, very, very good core attractive revenue profile here. ', 'Let me just talk about the wealth management business first. We are organized in four channels, all of the channels are supported by foundational capabilities, practices and functions that are common. So our Chief Investment Officer, our Credit Officer, our fiduciary practice, our operations, our product and technology service, all our channels. ', 'Let me start with Ascent, this is our ultra-high net worth business. We launched this business about eight years back, and it has grown very rapidly for us in the eight years. We’re in five offices now. It’s a very successful business that you’ll see. It addresses the fairly niche and small market for us. ', 'Our largest business is the private wealth business. The legacy of this business is the old bank trust books, so it’s a very profitable business. With all of the changes in regulatory tax reforms, where the sales tax exemption limits have suddenly gone up, the demand for trust in the industry is quite neutral at this point. So, our work in this business has really being to transition it and transform it to a broad-based private wealth business. And two years back, we had a very important milestone in this business where the trust part of the business became less than half the business.', 'We have focused to carry much in this business and broadening just the investment part of private wealth, and that’s where we’ve gotten the 12%, 13% loan growth. Our banking practice has grown. Our insurance practice has grown here. So, very successful business. We’ve these beautiful tower offices, about 30 locations that we serve plans out of. ', \"Moving next to Affluent, Affluent is really our largest growth opportunities. These are $250,000 to $3 million in net investable assets of clients. This business three years back, when we were talking to you, was very challenged. You will remember at that point, the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule was at the height of uncertain outcome. It had the potential of changing the risk profile of the industry quite rapidly. The core products out of the industry which used to be annuities wherein structurally declined, both supply and demand had compressed. And as a result of it, a lot of advisors have left the industry. Today, we find ourselves in an environment that is much, much healthier for this industry. This is the bread and butter of U.S. banks' client base as well, so our opportunity is quite good.\", 'We started a transformation in this business about three years back when we fundamentally said to ourselves that the way to serve a client well is to bring all of U.S. bank to the client, and not have them try to find us when they needed us. So we created the construct of a team that included an advisor, a banker and other specialists. We align their books. We align their commission structure. We align the space where they were sitting and their management chains became uniform.', \"Now this concept, as many of you might know, is not new in the industry. What has been unique to us is that we've actually made it work. This is a real testimony to the U.S. Bank culture. Our financial advisors that are quite different culturally from our bankers have come together in the best interest of a client to serve them well. The last two years, you've seen kind of fruits of this labor and boy, it was labor. This is -- this was hard work to client constructive, this chemistry between people who are quite different culturally.\", \"You've seen double digit growth emerging, we don't question the model anymore, and it's now about scaling. We are quite small in this business yet we do cover about half of its branches, 1,500 branches are served through some coverage, some financial institutions. We think across our households about three in 10 American households have investable assets out of their 401(k). So we have 12 million households that really love U.S. Bank that recognize the name. Our opportunity is quite significant here.\", \"The last thing I'll mention very quickly is this emerging wealth business. About two years back, we introduced the robo-advisor. We branded automated investor. This is a digital-only offering and it is meant to serve the needs of the early investor. It takes about a decade for an investor to accumulate 250,000 plus in assets, and where the needs become complicated enough that a team needs to serve them. So this is a new business for us just getting going. I should mention all of our channels are fully aligned with the U.S. Bank footprint by design. We'll continue to stay that way. Our goal is to be the investment option for a client who's had familiarity and experience with U.S. Bank for a good amount of their time.\", \"So Andy talked about digital being the word count winner. So let me do my bit here. We started the digital transformation about in 2016. Actually, Terry launched it when he was in my position. And since then, every year we have dropped fairly substantive capabilities along the way. We talked about the robo-advisor. We've just introduced version two this year, which is much improved. We introduced digital planning a real commitment to service clients holistically. It's a collaborative tool. It has been a very successful capability for us.\", \"What we are working for most is data aggregation and data analytics. You've heard from Jeff. You've heard from Derek. And I will tell you this corporate capability on data analytics has been a sheer joy to me. It is so cool for our business. Our predictive models can actually tell us which client is at risk of attrition. We have seen our attrition drop 2 percentage points. It's a powerful profit lever. We can tell and predict not who is wealthy, that's actually table stakes. You can literally Google a person and you can know who is wealthy. But what we can tell is where are they encountering a life moment that matters, so that we have the right advice offered at the right time. We can tell who is getting married in a year, who is about to have a baby, who might have a divorce, who is thinking of moving, because they have a new job lined up. And those are the tools and techniques that we are really utilizing to augment a robust referral model that exists. We have a metric that we measure called the wealth management digital interaction and that is steadily growing at 33%.\", 'The last point I wanted to make is just around a product set and what this means for deepening our relationship. We have every product that a wealthy person might need. In our industry, the wealth industry the four formats that are dominant. The biggest is the broker dealer world. The second is the bank-owned wealth management. The Independent RIAs is the third and the digital platforms like Fidelity and Schwab. Everybody is trying to get to the place that we are already in where they can truly offer all products sets.', \"We've had these products for a long time. What's new is all of the compensation, culture team organization that actually lets the advisor team deliver all of these products. I've shown you some metric on the right hand side. The advisor productivity has really shot up in the last three years, driven by new planned acquisitions, much more than cross sell within a relationship.\", \"So that's the story on wealth. Let me turn to investment services, also a business focused on investments but on the institutional side. This business, the set of businesses, is quite unique to U.S. Bank compared to our peer group. Very capital efficient business. Let me talk about Corporate Trust. This is kind of a technical business. It really started during the California gold rush when an individual, a trusted third-party used to hold cash between a commitment made by an investor and a gold prospector. We have become that individual trusted and we are the corporate trustee.\", \"Today, by-law every time there is a bond issuance, a securitization any kind of a debt raise, a third-party corporate trustee is needed. And we hold the cash and trust. So you have to be a bank today and that's why we gather in lot of deposits. A majority of these deposits are operational deposit. That's our business. We have number one or number two market share in almost every segment that we play in, and the root cause is technology. Our technology platform here is called Pivot. Derek was kind enough to label it the Killer App. Thank you, Derek. The creativity of the app is less the user experience, although that has improved with the help of digital office, but the data and the analytics and the insights behind it allow every credit manager to manage their risk in a very high quality way, and we're able to provide that in the real time.\", \"Fund Services is the second business focused on money managers. This business was so high return in the 80s as they rode the wave of mutual fund assets. It attracted significant players in capital in the industry. We have a very niche unique position. We could beat the massive players in this but we are very good with complexity. The credit managers that our corporate trust managers are shared in large part by this business, and because our operating model is quite different from some of the large players. We don't have massive functionalization. We don't have off shoring. We have a very stable group of people who really understands managers. Our business model appeals to that kind of niche, and we have really done well with that niche. Assets under administration is the metric that this industry uses. We clock in at $6.8 trillion. That makes us number eight globally. So we are quite substantive here.\", \"How did we build this business? Because it is the unique businesses. It's a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. We have done 23 acquisitions in the last 15-20 years, got very good at doing them quickly and integrating them on one platform. In recent years, it has more been driven by organic growth just because the industry has consolidated. I will tell you outside of the U.S., the industry remains quite fragmented. And in certain niches, like the alternative segment, the industry is quite fragmented. So M&A remains a big part of our strategy and we are always looking. So today, we have 22,000 clients, 80 offices, about 5,000 wonderful colleagues serving clients.\", \"Here I want to talk a little bit about how our business model is different because of U.S. Bank ownership. I've been here for years. I studied this a lot. This business is more profitable than I thought it should be. And I figured out why. So I just want to share some numbers with you. The power of the deposits and the balance sheet is very strong at U.S. Bank. We have grown deposits in the last three years at 6%. That far outpaces the industry growth rate. What is really powerful is a NIM applied against these deposits. That's more than twice the industry average. You can do the math on $72 billion in deposits here on what twice the NIM means in terms of our profit, and our ability to invest in technology that has just rolled up our market share organically.\", \"I would be remiss if I didn't mention points two and three. I call it like free salespeople and free distribution, thanks to U.S. Bank. Leslie and Jim will describe the corporate and commercial franchise to you. It is an excellent franchise. The relationships are really deep. And every time they're negotiating credit, we are on the table as the fee based option to complete the relationship. Quite a unique angle and this is the contribution of a community bank, which I would not have thought was a immediate synergy with our investment servicing business. But I'll give you an example. We are number one in our municipality segment. There are 40,000 municipalities and townships in the U.S. If you really had to, the segment is huge but still fragmented. If you had to go call on these people to that tiny deals you need hundreds of people. We have a thousand-thousands of people. They understand our product set and they bring the referrals to us, so quite an interesting story. And the ownership by U.S. Bank has been quite an important part of the growth story in these businesses.\", 'Let me just describe a couple of case examples. So you know how organic growth is happening in this industry. On the left hand side, we have a registered investment advisor. In 2010, they had just gotten started, a few of them split out from a large company. They had some clients that needed bank custody. They liked our service. When they all started their own funds, they hire different services part. And all new fund launches has come to us. They have $25 billion in assets today, very large RIA. And more recently, the wealth management partnership with them has been we provide all the banking and credit for their investment plans. Their fee revenue has also now qualified them for a credit relationship. And the revenue has grown about 13 times in a short period of time.', \"We can repeat the story on the right hand side abroad a very large, very elite global asset manager. They're a credit manager. We acquired them. We have tiny relationships, went through an acquisition. And they liked our service, started giving us more, grew rapidly, we just grew them. Their fee profile made them eligible for corporate credit. And these guys are very grateful if you can give them corporate credit. So the relationship has deepened. When they went to London, they took us with them and we are going to believe with them, 23 times the revenue. So that's kind of a simple way of you serve a client well, kind of grow with them.\", \"Our strategy on the investment servicing side, just to bring it home a little bit. The technology and digital capabilities are real white space between us and our competitors, and we intend to keep it there. There is a lot of support from our technology and digital offices to try and keep up the platform. And Pivot is now expanding to every client that we are servicing from an investment services standpoint. Technology is also very important to drive cost and productivity. These are ops and tech business, and lots of distributed ledger technology, lot of natural language processing that we're introducing to just drive operating leverage. Our operating leverage in this business is very strong, very scalable businesses.\", \"Global expansion, which we have a lot of opportunities on, has been a big focus over the last three years, and we will drive our growth going forward. We have just enhanced our European depository products. Those are lot of press releases a few months back, completely revamped our global custody network, much better quality. And we are just setting up shop in Luxemburg. So lots of headroom there with M&A and organic growth. Finally, delivering one U.S. Bank, I gave some examples on the balance sheet synergies, the distribution synergies. We are also building out of securities lending and foreign exchange capabilities, which we have but haven't been fully scaled and optimized yet.\", \"So that’s really our story. Let me just close it out. In summary, just to remind you of some key messages we like to have you take away on the wealth management side. We're in an incredibly strong position on the high end of the wealth segment. The product set is complete, clients are very happy the word of mouth referrals that were networked along with the data analytics was just a really nice business. And a big growth opportunity is in the Affluent segment. We think the team concept is very successful and we have made it work. So that’s going to be the growth driver of this business, going forward.\", \"On investment services, we are at scale in a very capital intensive business, with barriers to entry. It's very efficient, high fee, high growth. We want to keep up the lead foot products and technology. And growth will come from organic market share, global expansion augmented by M&A.\", 'So thank you. We are very proud of this business. Thank you for letting me present this a little bit. With that, let me pass it back to you.', 'Andy Cecere', 'Thanks, Gunjan. So I talked about business mix earlier. This is great example of capital efficient scalable businesses that are fee oriented, offer higher returns and are a little unique to the banking, so great example of that in this business.', \"Now we're going to our consumer business banking that most banks have. But earlier I talked about this concept of balance about optimizing today to invest for tomorrow. And I think no business has seen more of that change and that optimization and balance for the future than the consumer bank. Tim has been leading us for two years, and he's going to tell you the story.\", 'Tim Welsh', \"Thanks very much, Andy. Very grateful for the opportunity to be with all of you this morning, and to represent our 30,000 colleagues who work in consumer and business banking. Let me describe a little bit about consumer and business banking, just so you have some of the context here. We represent about half the loans and deposits across U.S. Bank, about 40% of the revenue. And if you look at the split, it's about little more than 80% traditional consumer businesses, think mortgage, auto, checking accounts, et cetera. And then about little less than 20% small business, business banking is what we call it. So that gives you a little bit of sense of the scale, reach of the business.\", \"We've been fortunate to have steady increases in loans and deposits over the last couple of years, and we're going to talk more in detail about what is driving that, but you will see several different factors. And I know this will come as a big surprise to you, but we’re very focused on digital. You might have heard that a little bit. And what we passed a critical threshold here recently in the consumer bank, which is that we’re now above 50% of our customers actively engaged digitally. What you see is also a huge increase in mobile that’s really up there. Very, very significant growth in mobile, and we’re going to talk about the mobile app that Jeff and others have referenced really being a pivotal part of that.\", 'Andy talked about the fact that two-thirds of our transactions are occurring digitally. And very importantly, we’re seeing sales migrate to the digital channels. What you’re seeing here is more than a third of our loans, actually being in some manner, done digitally. And we’re going to talk about why that’s been happening, because we’ve been making significant investments in that area. But this is the pivotal switch also, which is it’s not just about transactions occurring digitally but also about the sales migrating in that direction, and we’re certainly seeing that.', 'Given the scale of the business, we’re quite substantial player in many parts of consumer and business banking. You see some of the rankings here; number four mortgage lender; number four servicer; number five auto. The rankings are sort of interesting. But what’s much more interesting I think is if you think about how these different businesses become ways to attract new customers to the bank, because we -- sometimes we think about people coming to a bank first as from a checking account, and we certainly have our share of those. But what we’re actually finding is that the real value in being in so many different consumer businesses, not just mortgage, auto but also credit cards, which Shailesh will talk about, is that today, half our customers come to U.S. Bank for the first time through one of those lending products, and it’s an enormous opportunity for us.', 'So it’s nice to have those good positions. But what it really reflects is an opportunity to attract hundreds of thousands of new customers every year to U.S. Bank, and be given the privilege of trying to serve them.', \"So let’s talk about some of the key strategies and initiatives that we have going on in consumer and business banking, and I want to bucket these into two categories. The first is as you’ve heard, we are becoming digital, and we’re going to talk about that in a lot of detail. But very importantly, we also believe that customers still want and value and benefit from human interactions with our bankers. And we’re going to talk about exactly how the digital and human work together, because we think that is the critical component of success. And most importantly, it's a critical component of being incredibly helpful to our customers, which is what we’re trying to do.\", \"All of that new interactions with digital and our people allows us to think about an entirely different physical distribution system, and we’re going to talk a lot about that. Andy referenced the efficiencies that we’re seeing in that front. It is absolutely efficiencies but also as he highlighted effectiveness. We’re able to do things for customers in our branches that we haven’t been able to do before, and we're going to touch on both of those elements.\", \"So as we think about our customers, we’ve been talking about the fact that they are absolutely at the center of everything we do. And I want to tie this back to something that Kate started with. Kate said that we’re here to power human potential. We invest our hearts and minds to do that. And Derek highlighted that that's the reason he came to this bank.\", \"I want to then connect this, the idea of centrality. We're becoming -- we're trying to become central to the lives of our customers. That's important. What that means is that we're really valuable to our customers, that they depend on us, that they think of us, that they have an emotional connection to us in ways that are really meaningful. We're not just a mortgage that they pay or an auto loan bill. If all that -- if that's all we are, then we're not doing anything to power their potential.\", \"So this concept of centrality is very important. And the core underlying element of it is the idea of engagement. What we're trying to do with our customers is engage with them as frequently as we can. Derek talked about this with the large tech companies. He highlighted the fact that they focused on time spent with them. That's an idea that we're trying to replicate but we're trying to do it in a very important way. We want to interact with our customers a lot but we want to make sure that every time we do, we are helpful to them. If we're helpful to them and they interact with us a lot, it will help us build trust, which Kate and Andy highlighted is so central to what we're doing. So that's really the core.\", \"Power human potential by engaging a lot, become central. We become really valuable to them and naturally, it expands our relationship with them overtime. So that's really at the core of what we're doing. And we want to talk about that with regard to specific segments of customers. So we're going to talking about it first with small -- with mortgages, and then talk about it for small business customers and then third, digital overall.\", \"So let's talk about mortgage. Why start here? If you think about most consumers, one of the biggest financial decisions that they will make in their life is buying a home. It's exciting. It's full of joy when they actually get in the home. And it's also can be full of anxiety along the way, because you want to make sure that you're actually able to live in that dream home that you've seen. So we want to make this process as simple and understandable for the customer as possible. And so about two years ago, we started investing in technology to make it a whole lot easier to get a mortgage. And as you see, we've been steadily building that investment overtime, a couple of highlights.\", \"Middle -- late last year, we were the first bank to introduce what we call, instant decision. We're able to pull data from lots of different financial institutions. And for credit -- for certain credit approved customers we can give them a credit approval in minutes. What that means is you can literally be standing in the condo in Manhattan here that you have just found. You can type into your phone and apply right on your phone. And assuming you're qualified, you can get that decision why you're still in that living room. We then have used digital -- analytics and data to help our mortgage loan officers make sure that they get the best leads. So Gunjan talked about this. We now know when people are moving, or prospect of moving. We can generate a lead to suggest a call that's helpful.\", \"We've now applied this same technology to our home equity process. And we've also done it to our mortgage servicing. We actually have millions of customers whose mortgages we serve. And you don't think about that as particularly digitally engaging opportunity. But in fact, not only have we made it easier to make payment on your mortgage, we've actually made it easier to make payment on your mortgage, we've actually made it easier for you to learn about your neighborhood and to see how other houses are selling in your neighborhood. That's incredibly valuable and we're seeing our mortgage servicing customers get excited about that as well. So this is a really powerful opportunity for us to become central in something that is so important. And this is going to be an area that we're investing on continuously, because we believe if we were going to be central to someone's life that we need to be really, really helpful to them in getting a home.\", \"I want you to then think about a small business owner. I love talking to small business owners. They are some of the most passionate, enthusiastic people you will ever find. And you know what they're passionate about they're passionate about their business. They're not passionate about funding their business, right? And so we thought we should make that simple. And so we were the first bank in the country to introduce a loan of up to $200,000 to $250,000 that you can apply for online or with the help of a banker, and we can give you a near instant decision. A process that typically took days or weeks now takes hours or maybe a few days and often can be done in under an hour. It's unbelievably fast.\", \"We did this not just through cool technology and believe me, the technology is pretty cool. But we did it because we changed our process. You'll see here that we reduced the number of fields that we asked them to fill out by more than 70%, so that we can give them a loan a whole lot faster. We made it much, much simpler. But I want to highlight something, because you all know that we have great risk management and credit guidelines. We didn't change any of that. Same risk criteria, same compliance standards. All we did was make the process a whole lot simpler.\", \"And that was just the beginning. We're now investing in our -- in loans up to $2.5 million. So we've significantly automated and simplified the process for loans all the way up to $2.5 million. We introduced that in August. And when we go into Charlotte, we're going to do something that is really powerful, a terrific one U.S. Bank story, which is that we're going to be introducing in Charlotte what we call the triple play, check-in, credit and importantly, merchant services. Because what we realized is our small business customers want all of those things brought together in a very simple manner.\", \"What I would highlight about this is that this is another example of how customers respond digitally, but then also engage with people. And it's a great story, as an example, from Appleton, Wisconsin, where customer, a prospect -- excuse me, finds this tool online, applies for a loan, gets the loan, comes into our branch and says, can I transfer all of my business accounts to you? Fortunately, we were able to say yes. So that's the kind of human and digital interaction that is so powerful here.\", \"What I would highlight about these two stories, the mortgage and the small business, is not just are we able to do great things for the customers but we're also able to see real benefits for the bank. You saw on the mortgage slide, huge improvements; 25% reduction in cycle time; material increases in market share; costs, we're able to process 30% more mortgages with the same team. The same thing is happening in these small business loans. We're making huge increases in volumes with the same level of productivity. So what's important here is what is good for the mortgage customer, what is good for that business customer, also benefits the economics of the bank.\", \"Now, I also want to talk about the fact that we've been describing mobile banking. And both Derek and Jeff have talked about our new mobile app. And it's extraordinary how fast we've redesigned it, et cetera. But I want to underscore that this is not just a niche technology. There is an idea under here that I want to make sure you fully appreciate. What is different about this, what we've tried to make different, is back to this idea of centrality, right? What we said in centrality is we want to engage with the customer a lot so that we can be helpful to them. And this app is designed to do that.\", \"So in very simple ways what you see is, if you use our app and you have one of our credit card every time you use your credit card it pops up and says, you just spent $30 at this restaurant. But you know that and it's a great fraud protection tool. It by the way also creates very interesting dialogs between husbands and wives, which is not a -- not something that we're in control. But that's an example of the interactions.\", \"But what is also happening here is that we're able to provide personalized insights to people in ways that are genuinely helpful to them. So what you see is, in just the four months, the first four months that we launched the Apple version of this, we created a 100 million personalized insights that we provided to our customers. And almost 90% of them they said were really helpful to them. So that's a different way of interacting. Every time you get on the app, you see something very often that says, boy, look at your spending pattern. Did you realize that this -- your deposit just came and all of those helpful kinds of things come to you on a regular basis in the app.\", \"And what we're seeing as a result of that is a significant increase in the amount of engagement. Already in the short time since we've introduced the app, we're seeing a 50% increase in the amounts of interactions and engagements that customers have on our app. So this is a material shift, not only in the technology but in the underlying idea. And we believe that that allows us to become more central, which allows deeper relationships more trust, all of that.\", \"Only other point I want to make about the app is that it in fact allows us to be truly one U.S. Bank. And you see on the right-hand side of this, you can do wealth, you can do business banking. All of these kinds of things are available to you through the app, because, A, it makes it easier for consumers but, B, you think about small business as an example, small businesses, they expect the same conveniences in their business life that they do in their personal life. And that's where we want to be able to integrate these things as easily as possible.\", \"So what I've touched on now is that we're trying to become central to the lives of our customers by digitizing so many different aspects. And when we do that, we also create new opportunities for human interaction, like I talked about in the business banking. But also ways that significantly improve our economics and you saw those mortgage numbers, the small business numbers, et cetera. You're also seeing that with the app. What we're seeing just as an example of the efficiency measures is that we're seeing a material reduction in call volume in our call centers, right? Because people can do so many things themselves, just as Derek reference, DIY, right? So significant cost reduction is there.\", \"But perhaps the most material place we're seeing efficiencies and effectiveness changes are in our branches. And many of you have wondered how we're doing on our physical asset optimization process. We've talked about the fact very publicly that by the first quarter of 2021, we will have about 10% to 15% net reduction in the number of our branches. And I want you to know that we are well on the path of that. In this year alone, we've closed 140 branches. I'm going to come to the reinvestment side of this in just a second, because I want to emphasize, this is not just about closings. This is about finding growth opportunities in many new places. But it's also not just about the physical footprint. It's about what goes on in that branch that's also critically important.\", \"When you think about it, if you can do so many things in your life digitally, what you need to do in a branch. Well we're finding at least a couple of things that are really important to do in branches. The first is, people often need help, often help with the technology. What we're discovering is we put all these great features into our app. And you know what, many people discover them on -- all those features on their own, but a lot of people don't. A lot of people really value having somebody to talk to about the different features. You think about a simple feature like mobile check deposit. I suspect many of you use that. Take a picture, deposit the check. But many customers actually don't know about that. And what we're finding is enormous success helping educate them about those kinds of features, and there are countless features that we can provide that education for.\", \"At the same time, what we are also seeing is that people say, gosh, now that I have all this information about myself because my app aggregate things, all of my different customers information, what goals do I have. And can I talk to somebody about goals, and how do I think about managing for the future. Those kinds of discussions we are also having in branches. So what I would highlighted is that we're absolutely changing our physical footprint, both to reduce costs and to increase growth, but we're also changing the nature of what happens there in the branch in order to be really helpful to our customers.\", \"You're all also aware that we're exploring new markets, and let me tell you how we think about new markets. We've announced of course that we're going into Charlotte. But let me describe the underlying logic of why we're going into Charlotte. The first is we're looking for markets where we already have a presence. Now many of you are aware that we have more than 800 of our colleagues who live in -- live and work in Charlotte already. They've invested millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours of volunteering to help build a presence for us in Charlotte. But that's now all we have in Charlotte.\", \"Remember I mentioned that many customers come to us, to the bank from credit card, auto, mortgage. We already have, through those product lines, tens of thousands of customers in Charlotte. And we've got a material portion of our assets, deposits and things like that, particularly loans, in that area. So it's one thing to say, oh, U.S. Bank is going to a new market. I'd like you think maybe about a different way to contemplate that, which is U.S. Bank in bringing a branch to a place where we already have a great reputation, great employee base and a terrific set of customers and that's what we're doing.\", 'Just as Andy said, branch-light, digital-first, going to serve customers we already have and hopefully, beginning to expand that over time. And we will pick other markets like that where we have a great presence already, where we’ve got a lot of customers and where we think we can bring a branch to them to serve a broader set of their needs and become more central to their lives.', 'And I’d also highlight some of the reinvestment opportunities. It’s not just places like Charlotte. Charlotte may get a lot of great headlines and we’re very excited about it. But as we look across our footprint, what we’ve highlighted here are all the places where we’re going to be doing renovations or new branches, because we see enormous growth potential in those places.', \"What often happened, for example, is we'll have a great downtown set of locations in a city but see opportunities in new suburbs where we haven’t had a branch before to be able to grow in those areas, or we perhaps have a branch in those areas and we get the opportunity to renovate it, and make it more contemporary and be more inviting for the kinds of new services that we’re offering in that area.\", \"So in summary, I'd highlighted a couple of things. The first is we really are trying to become central to the lives of our customers, so that we can power their human potential, that’s the core. And this concept of centrality is rooted in the notion of engagements, making it easy for them to interact with us and importantly, with those engagements be helpful to them.\", 'We’re also trying to do this in a way that is incredibly simple. You saw that in the mortgage process. You saw that in the small business loan. We’re trying to make it incredibly simple for the customer so that they can do the things in their life they want to, like run their business or go to Disney World, or whatever it is that they’re trying to do.', 'We’re also cognizant of, for us to be able to do this, we need to be able to operate at speed, and Derek and Jeff and others, have highlighted this. Almost all of the innovations that we have talked about in the consumer bank in the last -- little bit here, almost all of those innovations have been done in the last 18 months, building on, just as Andy said, the terrific example of innovation we had in our payments business.', \"And so what we see is an enormous amount of speed that we are able to achieve, and we expect that speed to accelerate as we go forward. And the reason for that is very simple. Our customers' expectations are rising all the time. They expect more and more out of us. And so while we’re incredibly excited about all the innovations that we’ve been able to develop so far, we know this is just the beginning. And we’re going to continue to work at that level of pace and intensity to keep up with those rising expectations, because we are absolutely determined to be central to their lives so that we can really help them power their potential, live the lives that they want to live.\", 'Thank you very much for the opportunity to describe what’s happening with Consumers and Business Banking.', 'Andy Cecere', \"Thanks Tim. So centrality, simplicity, optimization and reinvestment, a lot of change going on in the consumer bank, and I think we have a clear strategy for what we’re trying to achieve. Next up is Corporate and Commercial Banking. And I will tell you this is a business that over the last 10 years has gone through a lot of change. So the change in Corporate and Commercial happened in many cases, and they’re going to really benefit from what they’ve created in the structure they have from one U.S. Bank standpoint. But the next set of change is you’re going to hear about is the real-time payments component that's going to change the way companies do business, and the way we’re going to help them achieve those goals.\", \"So you're going to hear from Jim Kelligrew and Leslie Godridge who lead this business. Both of them have been in here in excess of 10 years and have a great story to tell. We'll start with Jim.\", 'Jim Kelligrew', \"Thank you, Andy. So let's go through a quick snapshot of the Corporate and Commercial Bank, just our financials. So first three primary customer segments, Commercial Banking, we define as clients revenues of $25 million to $500 million. So I think all of us think about as middle market clients. We have a big corporate banking business obviously, its $500 million revenues and above that we define it also -- that also includes our any government entities. And third primary one would be commercial real estate, which is targeted more on the upper middle market and above, and both public and institutional clients.\", \"We have two big product areas, fixed-income cap markets and treasury management, which I'll get to little bit more in a second. But also just note were 18% of the banks revenues and roughly a third of the deposits and a third of the loans. So treasury management and fixed-income capital markets about the same number of revenues. Fixed-income and capital markets is very client driven and origination focused, there is no proprietary trading, we don't have an equity capital markets business, and so that obviously gives us a very kind of versus our peers much more predictable consistent revenue stream.\", \"Looking quickly at our loan portfolio, it's very diversified and high credit quality. The largest component part is large corporate, which is predominantly investment grade. In addition to the three primary customer segments that I mentioned, the other piece there is called specialized finance, which is basically two big parts, an asset-based lending business and an equipment leasing business. When you look at our loan growth, there are three underlying factors that I would say for the 1% CAGR over the last 2015 to 2018. One is we saw really good solid C&I loan growth and activity.\", \"We also saw in 2018 as all of you know because of tax reform, a significant amount of loan payoffs, corporations with lots of cash on their balance sheet. And then third, we just kept a very consistent and disciplined approach to our commercial real estate loan underwriting. On the deposit side, the story there is really that 1%, from 2016 to 2018 if you strip out one large financial customer who's been migrating from the bank due to an acquisition event our growth is more about 4%.\", \"So looking at our competitive advantages. I've been in banking for 32 years, and I have been at U.S. Bank for 10 years. And I have to tell you that U.S. Bank has an awesome underlying platform to build and grow a corporate and commercial bank. It’s a big reason of why we've been successful in the past and have been growing market share. It will be, continue to be, a very big reason why we're going to be successful in the future.\", 'More specifically, our highest debt ratings, really truly differentiates us versus our competitors, particularly for certain product areas and more specifically, in our market based businesses. So think about being counterparty on an interest rate swap being the highest rated foreign currency transaction, et cetera. So we are the counterparty of choice because of our highest debt ratings. Our best in class risk discipline and I would add to that our strong ethical culture, really resonates well with our client base with U.S. as a really safe and dependable long-term relationship.', \"Our strong significant and unique presences, in Shailesh's payments business and in Gunjan's corporate trust business, gives us a competitive advantage where we can offer more holistic solutions to our clients across products that really differentiates us versus our competition. And as Derek powerfully articulated earlier, our culture of innovation underpins numerous B2B opportunities to be value-add and focus on the digital piece.\", \"Looking quickly at our strategy and key initiatives, expanding reach, that's all about going into new markets, I'll talk more about that in a second, as well as new product offerings or enhancing our existing product offerings. Second is deepening relationships. Think about that as we continue to deepen relationships. We want to become a lead bank, which really has a multiplier effect across our product areas and especially in capital markets. And third, which Leslie is going to hit on in a little while, is the digitization of business payments.\", 'So looking at expanding our reach, I wanted to look back at time for just a second and go back 10, 12 years ago, the last economic downturn, which was not fun for all of us in banking. U.S. Bank, as far as the commercial -- corporate and commercial piece, we had a regional presence. So look at the shaded area with the red stars. We were kind of a good solid regional bank in the CCB space. We have limited and basic loan products. We lent money, did deposits, letters of credit, et cetera.', 'Our competition in the meantime, during that same period, as I think we all know was significantly pulling back or pulling out of markets and products was not a fun time. We took advantage of that. And the first step was hiring Leslie in our New York office to build our large corporate business. That was about 10, 11 years ago. I joined about a year later to join in Charlotte to build out all the capital markets businesses.', \"So now fast forward, we'll talk more about in a second. We have a -- we've had a fully national presence lot different than 10, 12 years ago. But more specifically and more recently, over the last 18 to 24 months, we've been expanding our middle market presence in key states and having really great success, so Texas, Florida, North Carolina, which Tim mentioned, and New York. And those have been actually, from a low base actually zero from a couple years ago, our fastest areas for loan deposit growth so that's really, really exciting.\", \"We've also established a mid-corporate initiative. So what we found was, we were doing really well in the middle market and really well in the large corporate. And there's a space in between under Leslie's leadership, which is $500 million to $3 billion, where we now have an initiative and we're really making some great strides there as well. And you can see there, just on the right part of the map, the green stars, again, that just kind of fills in with the national presence.\", \"And then more specifically talking on the right side just about product areas, right? So we developed a new asset-backed warehouse lending business that just kicked off earlier this year. It's been very successful so far. But the point I wanted to make there, it's complimentary to what we're already doing. It's very complementary to our investment grade corporate bond business. It's extremely complementary with Gunjan's corporate trust business. And if you may remember, its number one in the structured trust area, which is a lot about is asset-backed.\", \"And so we've had a lot of good reciprocal back and forth there where they're helping us with business and we're helping them with business. And then we're investing heavily, because it's a huge product for us and we're very successful at it modernizing a Treasury Management platform. And Leslie, again, will get more into the targeted money movement solutions, which obviously we've been talking a lot about today.\", \"So when we say deepening relationships and uptiering credit, that's where we're really talking about becoming a lead relationship. The top relationship or top three to five relationships. And I'll talk more about that in a second. But how do we get there? Our best-in-class debt ratings and our consistency and I talked about, our competitive advantages, has helped us win roles as competitors pull back, or maybe they're not pulling back but they have headline risk. Obviously, they've been -- the market is strong right now, but there have been banks that have a headline risk and sometimes clients get nervous and they come to us. And we've been really successful in our industry verticals, which Leslie developed over the last, again, five to 10 years, where we've uptiered credit relationships, become a lead bank, which has a really nice impact on the rest of our businesses.\", \"And so proof in the pudding, look at the right there. So last Investor Day, three years ago to today, our number of lead loan relationships has been growing at a 10% annual rate. And that's huge because lead loan relationships is the primary driver to building a deeper relationship and doing other products within the corporate and commercial bank with our clients.\", \"So in that regard, a great example, if you look on the upper right box is our investment grade corporate bond business. Now to step back just to remind you, 10 years ago, the business didn't exist when I joined in 2009. Three years ago at Investor Day, we showed stats that we had moved up on the lead and co-managed basis, so that's just being an underwriter in a corporate bond deal, okay, to number six, with 33% share, that's 32% of every deal, there's 100 deals, we're in 33 of them.\", \"Fast forward to today, we're number five, with 42%. We're in 42% of every transaction. So that's what I think of as the footprint, the breath. We're in the big leagues now, which is great. But the needle mover as far as our PPI or our revenues is the bottom right. That's where we become a lead and being lending relationships help that. So three years ago, we were 11% and 13% market share by number of deals. That is now three years later, number nine in the top 10, 20.4% with plenty of room for growth. And if you question that, look to the left, this is internal data but just showing our fixed income and capital markets businesses across all our clients within Corporate and Commercial Banking. Roughly -- whether we lend money to them or not, roughly 5% to 6% do fixed income capital markets with us. Those that are lending relationships, it doubles. And then obviously, as we leave relationships, it gets even greater. So there's plenty and plenty of opportunity. And I would honestly say being in banking for 32 years, we're barely scratching the surface. We have lots of runway.\", \"And with that, I'm going to hand the mic over to Leslie Godridge. She's going to go into more detail and some examples of deepening relationships, as well as our money movement strategy.\", 'Leslie Godridge', \"Thank you. Leveraging the strength of one U.S. Bank. You just heard from Jim about how we've uptiered with credit, expanded our capital markets, done a lot of things, used the credit as an entry in many relationships. What you see on the screen right now is the full set of products across the U.S. Bank platform. Presently, we have a full set of point solutions. But what we're working on right now is integrating those solutions to provide our customers with a seamless experience. Just like you heard, they want in their retail life, they want it in the corporate life.\", \"So I'm going to show you two examples where we've done this. On the left is an auto manufacturer. On the right is an iconic consumer beverage company. As we expanded our product suite, you can see on the screen how we've definitely enhanced the relationship. But you also should notice the revenue growth. We doubled with the auto manufacturer. And with the consumer beverage company, we went from less than 1 million four years ago to 8.5 million over the past four years.\", \"Now why does this matter? It matters because there is such a rapid shift from paper to digital, and we have an opportunity to grow and deepen our relationships there. The market for B2B payments is $23 trillion, and 60% of the business is still done via paper. But that's changing rapidly. You heard Derek talk about the digitization of money movements. And paper-based payments shift to digital, it's going to change how all of our companies do business over the next five to 10 years. And nowhere will that have more effect than in the corporate and commercial banking space.\", \"As B2B payments shift from paper to digital, we can support and add value to our customers. We know our clients' priority. It's to simplify operations. It's to optimize cash flow. And that's why, and that's exactly why we're investing and focusing on those areas. Real time payment solutions, APIs, data analytics, this will eliminate paper. It will make it easier to connect to the bank. And it will enable data-driven decisions. All this adds up to simpler and more productive ways for our companies to do business.\", \"So in summary, we feel good in corporate and commercial bank where we are. We've spent the past 10 years creating products, expanding our geographies. We're going to continue to leverage that investment. And now we have a huge opportunity as we are uniquely positioned with a good percentage of our customers already with treasury management and payments. And we're going to expand into this business-to-business payments and get our fair share.\", 'So with that, I will turn it back to Andy.', 'Andy Cecere', \"Thanks, Leslie. So Leslie talked about the tremendous impact that payments is having in the business environment. And we've had a big payments business for two decades. In fact, it's one of the reasons that a lot of you are -- have a high interest in U.S. Bank is our payments business. I would maintain that there is no point like right now that this has become more important to banking, because of the integration of banking services and payments and money movement.\", \"So we're very fortunate to have this great business. And we have this great opportunity of integrating the capabilities across the rest of the Bank. And Shailesh is going to talk about that. Shailesh?\", 'Shailesh Kotwal', \"Thanks, Andy. So we have a really distinguished payments business. You've heard about it all day today. And it's really, really important in the world we are in where increasingly payments activity driven by the frequency and importance of this activity is becoming the cornerstone of all relationships. You certainly know that on the consumer side. But it is also true now increasingly, both in the small and large corporate side, also in the government space.\", \"I'll share with you a little bit more detail about our business, but three things really put us at an advantage. One is, we have one of the brightest product sets in the marketplace as far as payments activity is concerned. And the second is, we have a seamless integrated proprietary set of platform that allow us to present this activity in a very meaningful way to our clients and the way they are beginning to expect in the marketplace. And thirdly, you will find that we have one of the most diversified, distinguished set of distribution assets that we can deploy against this opportunity that is in front of us.\", \"Let's get into the details here. Payments represents about 29% of U.S. Bank's revenue stream. But more importantly, we contribute about 40%, just over 40% of our fee-based businesses. And Andy talked about this morning about the importance of fee-based activity and how in many times it is countercyclical relative to some of the other businesses that we have under the umbrella of U.S. Bank.\", \"These are also highly efficient businesses and high returning businesses. So, let's look at each of these businesses in a little more detail. The first one, the three businesses that make up our payments business is our issuing business. It makes up about 65% of our revenues within payments. The next one is our merchant acquiring business, makes up about 25% of our business. And the last piece is our corporate payments business, which operates in the very attractive B2B space, so that generates just under 10%.\", \"And you will see down in the second half of this page is, we've been growing this business at fairly attractive rates. The merchant business, as you are well aware, was impacted by some of the joint venture exists that we went through over the last couple of years. But you will also know that through this year, first half of 2019, that business has returned solidly to mid single-digits as we have committed.\", \"Andy mentioned that we are the fifth largest bank. You are familiar with our size and scale. But you will see here that we are top five performers across all of the payments activities that we participate in. We certainly are number five, number four in our issuing and merchant acquiring businesses, but we also are a leading provider in the increasingly important commercial payments business. We are number two in that space and number one in some of the activities. We are the largest provider of payment services to the U.S. Government. And we are the number one provider of financial services to other smaller institutions, and I'll get into that a little more detail.\", 'So you will see that we are operating at scale, not only on the consumer side of house but increasingly important on the B2B side of payments activity. The largest of our payments businesses, the retail payments business, this is our classic issuing business. We issue cards across all three major networks, Visa, MasterCard, as well as American Express, but we also are a national player in this business, thanks to the footprint that we have, but also the partnerships that we have. We have customers across all 50 states.', \"One of the unique advantages of this business and perhaps the best-kept secret is our operating platform. It's truly unique. It's proprietary. And it allows us to service, not only some of the larger clients like Fidelity but through that same platform we can offer distinguished turnkey solutions to some of the smallest credit unions in this country. We do business with over 1,400 financial institutions and collectively, they provide us distribution through more than 15,000 branches in this country, unprecedented reach.\", \"Our Elan branded program also allows us. Think this technology platform just an analogy here. Think of it as one big house, that's our propriety platform. But it has individual through rooms that are these individual relationships that we have with all these financial institutions. And each room has its own entry point and exit point. So they get this turnkey solution that is fully customizable to them on an almost ad hoc basis, most of them on a self-service basis.\", \"We also have a fairly focused co-brand strategy that provide us access to great names like Fidelity and REI, but there is no concentration risk in this portfolio. We have substantial partnerships here. You see there're 13 major partnerships. But through these partnerships, we have added distribution capability of another 18,000 distribution points. Again, adding to that distribution reach that I talked about earlier on.\", \"The next one is our merchant acquiring business roughly a quarter of the revenue, but this is one of our most international businesses within U.S. Bank. We obviously have a large footprint here in North America. But about third of this business is based in Europe and growing quite nicely. Again, in the space, we have a proprietary platform. Single platform that can help customers operate over 100 different currencies and that platform is available in over 25 different markets. Provides us unique opportunity in places like Europe where increasingly merchants are looking for pan-European solutions and one of the most entrenched providers in Europe can provide that service that we can, and we've been doing that for a number of years.\", \"Even more important in this new era where merchants are buying merchant services through software solutions, this new concept of integrated software vendors. And for those of you that are not familiar with ISVs or Integrated Software Vendors. Think of it as, if you are a small business owner and you're buying an inventory management system. Payment processing is fully integrated inside of that inventory management system. And so we provide services that integrate our services into these software packages that are then bought and sold via these software solutions that are very popular. So we have doubled down on the ISVs. I’m delighted to let you know that our software vendor partnership just over last year is up 40%.\", \"The next one you're familiar with, which is our focus in this space around vertical based solutions, because many of these verticals have their own needs, distinct needs that require the need to leverage the underlying data. And we've been at it for a long time. We have a commanding position in the airline space. We provide our services to over 100 different airlines globally. But we're also a leading provider, both in the hospitality as well as in the healthcare space. In the hospitality space, we service one of the -- some of the best known hotel chains in the world. And we are the leading provider in the increasingly important healthcare space here in North America.\", \"What we're also doing is making sure increasingly, for these merchants, providing payment services is not enough. They are also looking for integrated banking solution and that plays right into our advantage, having the best banking capabilities along with some of the richest merchant offerings, and our ability to provide a more integrated solution to this customer base.\", \"And the third piece of business that we have in here is our corporate payments business. We've been in this business for over 30 years. It positions us really well in this accounts payable automation push that is underway. We have a great set of product capabilities where our virtual pay capabilities is outpacing the B2B payments market growth. That positions us well in the market that Leslie just talked about, the $23 trillion of money movement that is moving from essentially paper-based to a more digitized data driven activity, and I’ll touch more upon that later.\", 'We serve over 200 of Fortune 500 companies in this space. And that’s again largely because of the relationship we have through our Corporate and Commercial Bank. That gives us feet of the table and increasingly these customers are looking for more holistic solutions. We operate two of the largest proprietary end-to-end network in the space. We provide freight payment solutions. Just last year, we issued payments to over 5,500 carriers in this country. But we also operate a proprietary closed loop fueled servicing business, and that’s through our Voyager network, Voyager is accepted in this country in over 320,000 locations.', 'The point here is not only reach but in this world where payments is becoming more important, the ability and knowledge to operate closed loop networks is increasingly important. We operate two of those in-house and have been doing so far very long period of time. This drive to virtual pay is fueling growth and our ability to capture the position that we have working closely with our Corporate and Commercial Bank positions us really well to make sure we capture the flows in this transition that is taking place.', 'Let me spend a minute about something Andy talked about at the start of the day here today. In this era of change and digitization that we’ve been talking about all day, there is a changing customer expectation. It’s yet clearly driven by simplicity and ease of use that Derek talked about earlier on. But in the payment space what is also important is control and security over that payment stream that is so vitally important for these businesses.', 'Andy talked about the most around loans and deposits that arguably getting stronger, because of AML and BSA type regulations. And one might argue that the moat around simple payment activity is narrowing, or maybe even evaporating. And that plays right into our advantage, because payments by itself is less meaningful to customers. They are looking for much more broader solutions and given the breadth of relationships that we have and the breadth of products that we have, we are best placed to leverage the data, which we’ve been doing for well over a decade, to be able to provide these customers with more holistic solutions.', 'Let me give you a little more depth around this. Take the traditional buying and selling process and the top chart describes how payments used to get conducted. And for 60% of the cases, that’s still occurs today. You want to buy something, you go to a separate program in your -- to create a purchase order. You go someplace else to get your invoice. You go to a third place to make the payment. Somebody else goes to another place to go, get that payment, reconcile it for the backend and on and on it goes. These were all individually provided bought and sold.', \"What we are trying to do is bring it all together in one place, so the underlying data can travel much more effortlessly to allow these processes. So as I think about the fact that if you’re making a payroll, you want to make sure that that integrates into your cash flow management environment. If you’re buying inventory, you want to make sure that it ties back into your inventory management system. You’re no longer just concerned about making and receiving that payment, that’s a given. How well those can integrate into your backend activities is what is going to determine who becomes successful at this and we have been at it for quite some time, we're going to double down on it.\", \"So that leads to our strategy, what are we looking to do over the next few years. You've heard about digitization, leveraging data. I'll talk a little bit more about how we are looking to expand that reach that we have. And last but not least is continuing to leverage these unique platforms that we have that allow us better integration at lower cost and efficiency for our benefit but also importantly for the benefit of our customers.\", \"Digitalization, Derek talked a lot about our ability to get seamless services to our customers. So what is more important is not that these services are available, but how well are those utilized. And let me give you a couple of examples. We double down on digital acquisition for our card business. Three years ago, I talked about the fact that we're going to do that. Our digital contribution for account origination in the credit card space is up 60% over this period of time.\", \"We launched simple services driven by geolocation-type technology that has become available more recently. Our consumer customers have adopted that over 50% of the time. So it's not the availability of the service, it's how well is it integrated into the technology that customers are expected to use -- expecting to use.\", \"An example on the merchant side where we are leveraging capabilities like virtual pay to allow customers that operate in the travel and tourism industry to make payments through digitized processes, this is a highly paper intensive industry. When you book travel online, the backend payment settlement between the travel agency and the hotel or the airline that you bought the ticket on is largely paper based. That's over $200 billion TAM for us to offer them. We are digitizing that not only through our own capabilities, but also partnering with some of the leading players like Amadeus in the space.\", \"We are continuing to expand our distribution and our product capability. Just a few examples. You know we have acquired some very attractive portfolios over the last three years, like Fidelity. But what you might not be aware is we have done over 60 such small transactions to our Elan brand, acquiring over $3 billion of assets over that period of time. And we've just added over six different companies that add capabilities in the merchant and the very important B2B space.\", \"The Expense Wizard at the bottom of the page here is an interesting piece of technology is actually available for you to review outside. It's really cool. It targets what I call the infrequent traveler. Think about the individual that's coming for an interview in one of your offices. They don't have your corporate card. How do they issue payments, highly paper based, very troublesome in the back end process of claiming that expense is at best friction-fill. This product completely transforms and eliminates that process, but also provides the entity in my example, you, the hiring manager, complete control over how they travel, where they stay, wherever they eat, and all of that is fully automized and completely in sync with your internal corporate policies. So it's not just the ability to make the payment and take out the friction from the process, it is making that process a lot more efficient and a lot less friction-fill.\", 'This is an important page for us. The left hand side describes how largely banking and payments used to get conducted, even as recently as a few years back. Banking products have their own silos and they bought and sold through customers through those silos. And payments products have their own silos. And merchant acquiring was largely who got first to that merchant was that point of sale device. That is no longer true.', \"Increasingly, we sit across the business manager, the owner, the CFO, or the treasurer, and they're demanding, the left hand side and the right hand side, come together more holistically. Not only from a pricing standpoint but there is a much more deeper need. They want to make sure that these processes have integrated back into their back end allows them to manage their own cash flow a lot better, allows us to have better conversations with them about financing their needs and protecting their supply chains. This is a fundamental shift that is occurring.\", 'Andy touched upon some of the M&A activity in the payment space. It is all coming together, because everybody is recognizing that payments is better placed when it is better integrated through other activities that we provide to our customers, whether it is the consumer or certainly true in the ever more important B2B space.', 'So in summary, let me leave you with these thoughts. We operate at scale across both consumer and B2B franchises. We have a fantastic set on distribution capabilities that we are augmenting. We are doubling down on our platform to provide omni-commerce solutions to our customers. We have terrific in-house platforms that we can leverage that provide efficiency for us and for our customers. But most importantly, because we are part of this unique institution, we can provide our customers with integrated payments and banking solutions.', 'With that, thank you.', 'Andy Cecere', \"Thank you, Shailesh. So you heard from all four of our businesses, you heard the concept of digital integration, optimization change, looking and transforming for the new expectations for the customer base. We're going to break for lunch. We'll reconvene at 12:30 Eastern Time. I would encourage you to experience some of those digital capabilities live and in-person right outside. We have a number of individuals anxious to show you what we're able to do. We'll reconvene at 12: 30. We'll talk about risk and then Terry will wrap it up with financials.\", 'So thanks a lot. Enjoy lunch.', 'Terry Dolan', \"Okay, good afternoon. I hope you enjoyed lunch. And we'll get started again with the individuals on the webcast, as well as those in the audience. So we talked about the overall strategy. We talked a little bit about technology, digital innovation, our brand and our culture. We gave a business line update. And we're going to wrap up the afternoon talking about some of those core disciplines I've mentioned earlier, starting with our risk management discipline.\", \"You've known US Bank for a number of years as being one of the strongest credit risk managers in the industry and that continues. And we're going to talk about that today. But we're also going to talk about some of the other emerging risks that we're faced as an industry as a bank overall, and applying some of those same strengths to those risks as we think about the way we manage risk management in the company.\", \"With us this morning, this afternoon, excuse me, are Jodi Richard, who has been Chief Risk Officer for just under a year, and with the bank for five years and Mark Runkel, who has been Chief Credit Risk Officer for over six years. I'll hand it over to Jodi.\", 'Jodi Richard', \"Thank you, Andy. Good afternoon. It's my pleasure to be here today to talk to you about our risk management strategy, as well as our risk management processes. Processes that are time tested in a core competency of U.S. Bank. When I became CRO last October, I was fortunate enough to inherit a strong risk program.\", \"You heard this morning from Andy we've invested a lot in our compliance and risk programs. Over the last three to four years, we've done that in our people, as well as our technology. So what is my role stepping into this was to say, how do we take what we've built and how do we optimize that for the future. So that's a lot of the strategy that you'll hear me speak about today.\", \"But before I go there, I do want to reinforce that the building blocks and governance that underpin our risk disciplines will not and have not changed. When we talk about our strategy, really what I'm talking about is, enabling that strong or ensuring that strong risk discipline and control environment, to enable business and revenue growth. And we're always evolving our thinking.\", \"So when I look at just the areas I want to focus on, I want to focus on ensuring that we have sustainable programs in place. So I'm not going to take the eye off the ball and what we've built, we'll maintain those and mature those into the future. We also want to look and stay ahead of emerging risk. And incorporate those into our programs and manage those for the future. A lot of our emerging risks ties to our strategy, and we need to sit side-by-side with the business and the technology groups to manage those risks as they're being implemented.\", \"And the last three items that you see on the left side of the slide are all around optimization. How do we simplify our processes? How do we use and leverage data in a better way to optimize, if you will, our risk management capabilities? And then how do we remain agile to support the business growth? And on the right hand side of the slide, you'll see our core principles for risk appetite. And I want to just stress that the business line strategies that you heard earlier today are aligned with our risk appetite and sets a strong foundation for our governance.\", \"We have invested, as I said before, in building up our risk programs over the last several years. We did that around our AML/BSA and our compliance programs, but we've also built our other programs. And in that building process, we've learned a lot. And those lessons learned, if you will, or what we call keys to success. And I just highlight a few of them here. The need to ensure we have top talent in specialized areas.\", 'We need to have consistent processes, tones throughout the organization that is consistent, good reporting and escalation. We need to make continued investments in new technologies and automation. And we need to promote more of the value, if you will, a relationship with regulators, with industry participants, experts, as well as law enforcement. I mentioned these elements are present across all of our risk programs. Our structure is sound and sustainable and we have mature risk routines in place.', \"That said, we're always looking around corners and staying ahead of emerging risks. We're investing in people, data analytics and technology to mitigate those risks. Our key emerging risk, a lot of what we've already talked about today, Andy mentioned some this morning; reputation, customer privacy, tariffs that are going on. But a lot of these risks are operational, as well as some of the risks that you see on the slides actually directly tied our strategy, digital interactions, competitive environment, real-time payments and emerging technologies. What this means is, we understand our strategy, but we also understand the risks that that strategy employees and the risk organization fits with the business, sits with technology to enable, if you will, that business growth in a prudent and safe way.\", \"I want to take a moment and highlight a few of our key risks, one being cybersecurity. Jeff mentioned earlier today the investment in our cyber defenses and controls. The risk organizations sit side-by-side with the technology and security group to ensure that we also from a risk management perspective, are testing those controls, as well as understanding our risk exposure. So, we've done several things. We've built an executive cyber dashboard that has key metrics in order to escalate items of our program in a quick manner.\", \"We conduct independent assessments using a series of industry experts to test our controls, identify potential gaps, as well as help us identify potential vulnerabilities and stay ahead of the evolving industry best practice. And we are constantly refining our playbooks, our scenario planning, as well as learning from others. We have our board here today and I'm sure they would tell you that cybersecurity is a keyboard focus, and we dedicate time at every meeting to this topic.\", \"One of the largest changes over the past two years is the changing risk landscape and money movement, and you've seen this from you heard from Leslie and Shailesh, this is a core in our business strategy. So this is an area that Jeff also talks about, that we've invested in technologies and people to enhance our fraud detection capabilities. We have fraud behavior analytics that we have on the front end. We've also enhanced our real-time transaction processing. We've moved from a batch environment to a real-time environment.\", \"We also are ensuring our operational processes are resilient in the real-time needs on the 24 hours a day. And as I mentioned, while we focus a lot of our technology enhancements here, they also are supported by the risk organization. Let's talk a minute about optimization. We've been talking about this all day and nowhere are we doing it more than in the risk organization, but I want to start first with how we're supporting business growth. We're aligned with the business in the agile studios.\", \"Derek talks about how risk is embedded in those studios providing real-time feedback in an effort to support business growth. I want to pause a minute and reinforce to you that agile does not mean fragile. We are not cutting corners and risk management. We are applying our same underwriting standards, our same compliance policies, but we're sitting with the business side-by-side, giving them real-time feedback in this has been extremely successful for us.\", \"If I move over to the other side, this is how we're acting within, if you will risk management. How we're innovating, simplifying, and optimizing? We have our own risk studio, where we have a dedicated team that helps the entire risk organization across credit operational compliance BSA/AML, to look for those opportunities that might contain points that we feel we can be more efficient and effective. We also look at our org structure and look to see where maybe we could consolidate to avoid duplication and overlap and to better streamline.\", 'We did that earlier this year and our second line of defense testing, team combining those to bring consistency, reduce gap and drive for the future. I would say where we have the most opportunity for optimization is leveraging our data and analytics. We are advancing our risk processes here and I took a moment and you will see I highlighted some real numbers on the slide for account organizations and transaction monitoring.', \"These are investments and new tools and models that have proven effective in annual loss avoidance in the space that crosses both and credit and fraud spectrum. We are also using what we've built that you've heard Jeff talked about the system and the platform that has transactional data in it that was built for AML KYC. We are using this and advancing our AI machine learning to detect superstitious behavior in our AML monitoring program. We doubled the accuracy in this improving our efficiencies.\", \"And finally, we are using data and automation in a smarter way that has allowed us to be more efficient, but most importantly effective in our quality assurance testing. I'd like to transition over to Mark to talk about credit risk.\", 'Mark Runkel', 'Great. Thank you, Jody, and good afternoon. We have a strong risk management and credit culture at the Company and that strong credit culture is critical for us to be able to support and grow throughout the economic cycle. The second piece is it enables us to be the most trusted choice for all of our key constituents, including our customers, and finally, it produces consistent results.', \"Our culture is really built on five pillars and I'll start with that we're relationship-based lender. Second, we are a cash flow lender. So, we look at the collateral in our underwriting analysis really as a secondary source of repayment. Third, we stay very consistent in our underwriting throughout the economic cycle. So, we're not making major adjustments to our underwriting over time. Fourth, we are proactive in our portfolio of our risk management approach in terms of active portfolio management. And finally, we have great portfolio diversification.\", \"We think that our diversification from a product type, asset class, we think of it from a geography, property type, all of those are key characteristics, help us to deliver consistent results. And you'll see here, during the last economic downturn, we had the least amount of volatility compared to any of our peer group and is it one that we know is true and tested and is why we're not going to be making any changes to our culture as we move forward.\", \"At this point in the credit cycle, we're beginning to see others in the industry starting to go down market. You are not going to see that show up in any of their credit performance statistics today, because it's too early. But what we want to stay focused in on is the origination quality and you'll see we continue to be very disciplined in our originations. On the consumer side, we continue to be a prime-based lender and you can see that based on the quality of the credit scores and all of our consumer-originated portfolios. We do not offer any subprime programs and we've stayed out of that business.\", \"On the commercial side, we continue to be investment grade quality or equivalent. We do have what I would say is a much smaller leverage loan portfolio compared to our peer banks. It's less than 2% of the commitments of the overall company. And the only place we participate in leverage loans is really to support existing customers who are doing strategic acquisitions where their senior debt maybe greater than three times in total that is over four times. So, it's a relatively small portion of the portfolio, but area that we will support existing customers.\", \"In our commercial real estate business, that's another area that we've been very disciplined and consistent because we been in the business for a long-time and we've been through many cycles. That approach served us extremely well coming out of the last economic downturn where you did see us taking market share really and really growing that portfolio. At this point in the credit cycle, we're seeing others becoming more aggressive and offering structures that we're not comfortable with, and so we're not going to change our lending standards, and that's why you've seen us lag in terms of from a growth perspective over the last couple of years, but we're comfortable with that.\", \"We talked about proactive portfolio risk management that's both looking internally within the portfolio as well as an extremely. When I look internally to our portfolio, I think of delinquencies, our risk rating, non-accruals, all of those are very strong across all of our portfolios, stronger than we were at going into the last economic downturn. And we're also monitoring the external environment. Now look at the unemployment market and what's going on in the labor market in particular.\", \"I look at unemployment claims and I look at the rates, and you can see on the chart on the far left that those remain at very, very low levels. Housing continues to be strong and the triple B bond spread is probably the only place we've seen any kind of what I would say movement and key external metrics that were monitoring just due to the flattening of the yield curve. So as I look at the portfolio internally as well as externally, I have great confidence that in the near-term that we think credit quality will remain relatively stable going forward.\", 'Finally, on through the cycle expected loss when I was here in three years going 2016, I shared this slide with you as well. Our expected losses through the cycle, we said was going to be between 95 and 100 basis points. We continue to grow the portfolio in the last three years in a very prudent approach and diversified across all of our assets and businesses and that through the cycle has not changed and remains at 95 to 100 basis points.', 'Jodi Richard', \"So, in summary, I want to end where I started that risk management processes are time tested in a core competency of U.S Bank and through our strong improved and risk discipline with our deliberate focus on the changing environment, we're proactively managing emerging risk, supporting business and revenue growth and are set up for long-term success. Thank you.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Thanks Jodi, Thanks Mark. So, we talk a lot about strategies, initiatives, key areas of focus strengths and areas in investment and I know for this audience, which you really want to know is how does this all translate into financial implications and numbers. Terry Dolan has been with the Company 20 years. He and I have worked together for a long time. He has been in the CFO role for three and I think there's no one better to bring at home in terms of the financial implications of all this than Terry. Terry?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Thanks Andy. So, good afternoon everybody, and thank you very much for being here on investor day, you know, it's really important to us to be able to share our story with you and to help you understand some of the great things that are really happening here at U.S. Bank and I think you have seen during the day. Andy started by really given a nice strategic overview in terms of what's happened in the organization, but also some of the changes that are happening in the environment out there.\", \"Some of the challenges that exist within the banking industry, but more importantly some of the opportunities that exist for a company that is willing to take -- to invest in the business and to take that opportunity. When you've heard from Kate, about our culture within the organization some of the thing that we've been doing from the brand perspective, you heard it from Derek and Jeff about above the glass and below the glass.\", 'And that above the glass is really focused around all the great things that we are focused on with respect to our customers and the experiences we’re trying to drive, the interactions we’re trying to create, and Jeff focused below the glass in terms of how we’re going to be able to deliver that from a technology standpoint, the micro services, the APIs, the tech stack, our cloud strategy and all of things.', 'They’re going to be able to drive efficiencies as we think about the business going forward. And then we had an opportunity to see how some of those broad strategies tie into the things of the lines of businesses are doing. And I hope one other things that you saw is that, many of those things are interconnected, payments helping to drive small business loan growth in the future et cetera.', \"So what I want to do is, maybe, provide sort of a capstone for the day with respect to how that translates from a financial management perspective for our organization. What I want to do is to talk a little bit about the last three years, and the performance during that timeframe. Andy talked about the fact that, we feel like we are well positioned and in a position of strength that will be my second segment. And then, I'm going to talk about, long term strategic objectives for the organization over the next three years.\", 'So, let me talk about first of all bottom line, net income and earnings per share. Three years ago, we said that, our goal our expectation with respect to net income was to grow at 68% and for earnings per share to be able to grow, somewhere between 8% and 10%. At the end, looking on how we ended up performing, we actually ended up getting there but we ended up getting there in a lot of different ways than maybe what we had expected. And probably not on a core basis the way that we head out to see, so our revenue was a little bit lower and I’ll show you that here in a minute.', 'Our expenses were a little bit higher, in a sense that we weren’t able to bring those efficiency ratios down as much as what we would like. But, we also made up with that, by great credit quality and our ability to have lower credit losses than what we were anticipating. And then we got benefit with respect to the tax reform act in late 2017. To think about the balance sheet, from a loan perspective, we grew the loans in line with the rest of our peer group.', 'Mark talked about the composition of our portfolio on between 2017 and 2019 that composition really hasn’t changed. Maybe commercial real estate has come down a little bit. We think about that overall growth during that particular timeframe, now I want you to think about at least three things, maybe four things one is we sold our loan portfolio again that’s sort of point in time, we sold over FTIC covered loan, insured loans during that timeframe.', 'We made some very conscious decisions with respect to our commercial real estate and the construction aspects associated with that portfolio, to downsize that, thinking about the risk associated with that type of a portfolio and how it performs in the reception of environment. So, those are the three things that we consciously made some decisions on.', 'And then with tax reform, loan growth in 2018 was very challenging and that certainly was one of the factors in terms of why revenue growth in terms of net interest income was a little lower. You think about deposits, deposits, we over that three year timeframe grew a little bit faster than our peer group, at 10.4%. The composition again is roughly 50% retail, 50% institutional, made up of the wholesale deposits with then Leslie and Jim’s world, as well as our corporate trust business which is a significant deposit gatherer for us. So about 50:50 in terms of how we think about the mix.', 'The next between non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits shifted a little bit, but that’s something that we certainly anticipated and expected three years ago because we were expecting a rise in rate environment. Jim mentioned the fact that, during a couple of years ago, we had a client that was acquired by a financial institution and a lot of their deposits migrated to their parent. If you end up backing that out, our deposits actually grew at about 13%. So relative to our peer group, we actually performed fundamentally very well with respect to deposit gathering during this particular timeframe.', \"Let's talk about revenue growth. So net interest income grew at about 5%, we had set a target of 6% to 8%, three years ago. One of the primary drivers associated with that is we got some additional tailwind related to the rising rate environment, which was what we were expecting although the yield curve flattened on us a little bit. And the other thing is that, in 2018 because of excess cash, tax repatriation, corporates going through the restructuring of their balance sheets. We saw a little bit better capital markets activities, but we saw loan pay down et cetera occurring in an effort to our timeframe and you see and you saw in 2018 loan growth was a little lower.\", 'Fee income, quite frankly was a little bit disappointing for us, we had expected and guided that our fee growth during this timeframe would be somewhere between 5% and 7%. Ultimately, it was about 3%, 2.9%, a couple of different things that were driving that. Mortgage banking revenue was actually a drag during that three year timeframe, some years as much as 18% to 20%. And our merchant acquiring business as Shailesh talked a little bit about, we made some decisions with respect to divesting joint ventures. We also made some decisions to exit certain businesses or relationships that were high volume, the very low margin, possibly even breakeven.', 'So, there are some things that were ended up influencing. The positive, if you think about it is that, we have now hit an inflection point with respect to our mortgage banking business, starting to grow in the second and we expect stronger growth as we think about the third and fourth quarter and into 2020. And our merchant acquiring business has been accelerating over the last several quarters, and we continue to expect that to continue to accelerate as we think about the future.', \"So, we had some headwinds, which we believe are now hit have hit some inflection points. From an efficiency standpoint, we ended up, in 2018, in early 2019 and that high 54%. So, we didn't really make the progress that we expected. We certainly expected in 2016, that our efficiency ratio would start to migrate down and probably be in that 53 sort of percentage point range at this particular point in time.\", \"One of the biggest drivers and we talked about is that in 2015, '16 and '17. And even in a little bit in 2018, our risk and compliance costs were elevated and some of those years growing up in excess of 25%. So, what was a headwind for us during that particular timeframe from an efficiency perspective and from a cost perspective, has moderated and that should be an opportunity for us. Also, during this entire timeframe, we were continuing to invest in the business and we also stepped up our investments. And I'll talk a little bit about that in a moment. But clearly, we added £5 to £10 and we really didn't expect to do that during this timeframe.\", \"Let's talk about returns. U.S. Bank has continued to be an industry leading organization with respect to returns. And our profitability is driven by a lot of different factors. It's driven by our mix of our business, the fact that we have a lot of businesses that are capital efficient. We have disciplined capital deployment et cetera. In every one of the categories that we end up measuring though U.S. base returns are at the top of the industry.\", 'If you think about sustainability, over the course the last three years really over the course last 10 years. U.S. Bank has demonstrated because of our lower credit risk profile, our diversified mix of businesses that we are able to sustain our earnings power during difficult times and we are able to reduce the amount of capital depletion for credit losses during times of stress. And those things translate into our ability to sustain a dividend over a period of time.', 'And if you look at dividends over the last three years, our dividends have grown by 11.8% on a compounded growth perspective, and two years ago we increased the dividend by more than 23% as last year 13.5% as part of the CCAR cycle. So, our dividend growth has been very nice during that timeframe.', \"Now I'd like to talk about why we feel like we're in a position of strength and we're well positioned as we think about the future. And I'll talk about a number of different things that Andy gave an overview before. The first is that we have a diversified business mix, and now we talked about four different businesses and you've heard from all those businesses here today, but underneath that is really 50 different businesses that all act a little bit different in different points of the business cycle.\", \"And that enables us to be able to have lower volatility with respect to our earnings throughout various types of business cycles and particularly in terms of fee based revenue. We have a couple of businesses that differentiate us. We have our payments business and I'll tell you that among our peer group, there are there are peers that would die to have our merchant acquiring our payments business because they know and understand the importance of payments is going to play in the future of banking in the next several years, and we talked about that throughout the day.\", \"Gunjan talked about our corporate trust business, our corporate trust business is capital efficient and it's a huge deposit gather particularly in times of stress. It is fee based, it is relationship based and it is a business that generates high returns, all these businesses help to contribute to our fee and net interest income balance within our company. More importantly, we feel like we're in preferred businesses and the businesses that we really like it's the right businesses for U.S. Bank.\", 'Importantly, our payments revenues are over weighted and relative to our peer group, and our trading and equity M&A sort of activities is under weighted. So, those are businesses that typically have more volatility where you have to rub two sticks together every quarter in order to make your numbers; and as you go through stress, our significant requirements with respect to capital. So, those tend to be more challenging as you think about resolution trust, our resolution plans and planning through a stressful cycle and we do not have that particular business.', \"Now, we do have a capital markets business, it's in the fixed income side of the equation is very much tied to our wholesale and our corporate and commercial bakery business. And what it does is it ends up as Jim talked about really leveraging that credit relationship that we have with our customers, and it actually acts as a way of reducing volatility because oftentimes when the yield curve flattens, the fixed income capital markets picks up even though you may see payoffs occurring on the lending side of the equation. So, it actually helps to reduce volatility in our situation because of the type of businesses that we are in.\", \"Our credit ratings, our credit ratings are among the highest not only in the United States but in the globe, and that has some significant competitive advantages from a financial standpoint. It's a lower cost of funding for the organization that provides us with a pricing advantage. So, you think about it from a loan growth perspective, our ability to be able to price more effectively in terms of being able to grow the balance sheet, and it's a -- it tends to be a flight to quality. So U.S. Bank tends to be a flight to quality during stress, and as a result, it enables us to be able to gather deposits at such point of time you wanted. It reflects that trust that we talked about in consumer confidence.\", 'Asset sensitivity and liquidity. We believe again that these are competitive opportunities for us as we think about the next three years. Let me talk about liquidity first. If you think about our risk profile, we have liquidity coming out of our ears. We have more than enough liquidity and in fact, we believe that that is an opportunity for us as we think about the tailoring rules change that will enable us. We believe to redeploy optimize or think about our investment portfolio in the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion and that gives us a lot of different options, which I believe is going to be beneficial in a sort of a rate environment.', 'With respect to interest rate sensitivity, we are relatively neutral in terms of our asset sensitivity compared to our peers. And while we give up a little bit when rates are rising, we end up performing relatively better in a declining rate environment. And I believe that based upon where the Fed is today and what 2020 looks like, that will be a competitive advantage for us. We tend to be balanced about 50% short-term, 50% long-term, the durations of assets and liabilities are pretty well matched. And of course, the interest rate environment is going to be an industry-wide challenge for the near-term.', \"When it comes back to cost structure, when you think about cost structure within U.S. Bank, relative to the industry, we're pretty fit and lean, but we know as I said that we put on a few pounds. Andy is a cyclist and in fact, when he comes to New York, he oftentimes goes to the Peloton Studio. And so, I want you to have this thought process in your mind. Everybody on the management team, when they come to work, they get on the bicycle and they work hard, they push hard in order to be able to drive cost efficiencies to be able to think about above the glass and what we're going to do with respect to driving and improving our customer experience, which is going to translate into revenue growth.\", 'Jeff talked about the efficiencies within our technology stack and moving to the cloud. All of those things are in play. When we think about the next three years, we have the opportunity to be able to optimize more of our business, and do things like rationalizing our risk management programs to make them not only more efficient but more effective in the future, all those different sort of opportunities exist. We are fit and lean relative to our peer group because of the fact that we have single processing platforms. We fully integrate acquisitions when they occur. We have businesses of scale and they run efficiently. They are capital efficient as well. And there is a lot of opportunities as we think about the future.', \"So now I'd like to talk a little bit about the long-term strategic expectations. And maybe to frame that out a little bit what I'd like to do is start by talking about some of the competitive challenges during the last three years that now are starting to become opportunities. I talked a little bit about our assets sensitivity that lower asset sensitivity in the future results in stronger relative performance in terms of net interest margin as rates declined. The elevated risk and compliance costs that were driving up our efficiency ratio in the past have moderated. And so we have an opportunity to be able to either reinvest those dollars and other parts of the business in order to be able to digitize and get the efficiencies in terms of DIY that Derek ended up talking about, or gain other efficiencies within our organization.\", 'Andy talked about that, the fact that AML/BSA and the consent order was a bit restricting with respect to our branch optimization. That has been lifted at the end of 2018, and Tim and his team have been working on physical asset optimization and moving forward with respect to reducing our branches on a net basis, somewhere between 10% and 15%. We believe that we have the opportunity to be able to increase that as we move forward, especially as many of the digital initiatives that we talked about take shape. ', \"Our credit risk profile is sometimes moderates growth in a rising rate environment on a robust economy. We're prepared for a recession and the events that it takes place. And we will perform well in a recession. In the last three years, there has been significant capital distributions that have occurred within the industry and we started at a lower capital levels because of our risk profile, but that run associated with capital distributions, higher capital distributions is pretty much coming to the end. But U.S. Bank is in a position with the tailoring rules to be able to take advantage of that, and to be able to manage our capital, little lower in the future. And I'll talk about that here in a minute.\", \"So when we are putting together the next three years, from a financial perspective. I just kind of want to share a couple of key considerations, like the Fed, we don't see a recession occurring, but if it does, we're ready for it. Our business is robust, consumer confidence is strong and employment is relatively low. So when we end up looking at the economy, we feel pretty good about it. The thing obviously that is creating a lot of uncertainty in the markets is really, really the geopolitical issues, trade, or tariff wars, and things like that that are happening there.\", \"From a global perspective, global rates are very low and when you end up thinking about the economic growth in Europe and to China starting to slow. We have a lot of global investors that are coming to the United States, buying treasuries, because on a relative basis, they can find yield. And so that is causing, those two things are causing her term race to the Fed that are reposition itself to move downward, and we think they're likely to move down to a target of 1 to 150. We've assumed 150, but the long end of the curve is also going to be relatively flat, we believe, at least through much of 2020. Credit quality will be stable.\", \"I'd like to talk about from a financial perspective, four things that we're very focused on. The first is portfolio management of our businesses. Now, one of the things that we have done over the course the last couple of years has really taken a really hard look at all of our businesses to think about their market attractiveness, their growth characteristics. Are they principally cash based businesses? Are they paper-based businesses? Are they businesses that we ought to be thinking about divesting or exiting?\", \"And in fact, a year ago last year, we sold our Elan ATM processing business. We got out of Retail Lockbox. We're exiting Africa business. We sold us student lending. We sold our FDIC covered loan portfolio; all those things really for the purpose of taking the capital that you would have to dedicate to those activities and reinvesting it in digital activities, agile studios, and all the different things that you ended up hearing about.\", 'The second thing from a financial perspective is physical asset optimization. And most importantly, we believe that there is an opportunity to be able to accelerate that to be able to increase the repositioning of our branches in the future. And when I talk about that, I think about it both in terms of the reduction in terms of branch closures, but also the reinvestment that Tim talked about in new branches and high growth areas, remodeling branches and high growth areas so that we are creating a better experience for our customers and creating revenue growth opportunities as well as optimization of the branch. And of course, what we will be doing is, taking into consideration the pace of digital adoption and the digitization, digital transformation that is occurring in the bank in order be able to make a decision as to how we and when to do that.', \"The third area is really around cost structures, cost optimization and focusing how we end up thinking about that. We talked about the agile studios, and a great part about the agile studios is that, we have the customers right there helping us to design the experience and to help, think about it from the perspective of, how that will help revenues to grow in the future, but it's also about simple, better, faster. Many of those million studios are focused on the business process and how we make things below-the-glass more efficient, better speed to market, et cetera that is really around that pillar of simplification.\", \"We have cloud computing, technology stack. We have organizational design. All these things that we're looking at, management spans and layers, and we pulled the trigger on some of that, and we have our other ideas, Tim in taking over the consumer and business banking as restructuring is management team in order to be more centric around the markets and more central to our customers, within those markets, and as a result be able to get efficiencies in these business as well.\", \"So, we are looking at every one of those things we want on our bicycle every day. All that is really to help us focus around how do we take that to reinvest for the future growth of the Company and there is a lot of different initiatives on here that are identified that we talked about during the day, but what I'd like to leave with you with respect to this aspect is. We stepped up the amount of investment. It's more than doubled in terms of capital expenditure over the course of last four to five years, where it used to be focused around defense. Now the majority of it is really focused on offense and we've spent about $2.5 billion on technology each and every year.\", \"And as Andy said, we do believe that, we have the scale, the simple business model that would enable that to be more than sufficient as we think about the future. So one of the things I know I have got a lot of questions on, as I have said through different investor conferences is really around CECL, and it's been interesting because all the questions and CECL have been around the day-one impact facility. And so, let me kind of go through that. Day one impact to U.S. Bank is going to be somewhere between 25% and 35% of the existing reserve.\", \"Our existing reserve at the end of the second quarter was about $4.5 billion, and so we anticipate that when we adapt CECL on January 1, 2020 that the impact is going to be somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion increase. Now the amount of that increase is influenced by leveraging macroeconomic factors at that particular point in time, but at this particular point in time again, when we think about whether or not there is a recession on the horizon, we really don't see that.\", \"The other thing it influenced in terms of size is really around, the characteristics of your portfolio, to the extent that you are more higher weighted with respect to credit card, your assets or longer dated in terms of having a higher mix of mortgage or installment loan. You'll tend to have a higher percentage of reserve build that day of adoption. And in our situation that's going to be the case. That represents today an allowance of about 1.5% going to an allowance that's about 1.9% to 2%.\", \"The thing that hasn't been asked by anybody is. What is the day-two impact with respect to CECL? And how is that could affect organizations in the future? Now, that going to have industry-wide sort of implication, but I think one way just kind of simply think about it is that This is an expected loss over life of the loan, which means that the provision that you need have to do will be higher than what you have had to do in the past.\", \"And if we are growing loans in order to keep our reserves at 2% assuming that credit stays stable, you are going to have to provide to that growth at roughly 2%, which is going to be higher than what it's been in the past. So I want, I think that’s an important question for everybody to keep in mind. I think there's two other things that I would just say and that is under this methodology there is going to be greater volatility that’s going to occur under stress and the comparability from one firm to the next is going to be difficult.\", \"And the reason for that is our economic outlook for the next two to three years is most likely going to be different than firm A's outlook and firm B's outlook. And so, I think one of things went up grappling with within the industry is how do we look at that comparability across the various firms. I like to also spend a moment on capital management. When you think about capital management, when we think about capital management we have certain objectives.\", \"We want to be well-capitalized we want to maintain that high credit rating that we enjoyed and we want to be sustainable throughout the business cycle. We have a capital target of 8.5%. Currently, we're running at about 9.5% and we believe that after the adoption of CECL and the tailoring rules that going to be about 9% to 6%, but that represents an opportunity for a buyback perspective because our expectation is that we will start to manage that 9.5%, 9.6% down somewhere between 8.5% and 9% in the future.\", \"So, that is an opportunity for our organization as we think about the next three years relative maybe to our peers. So, let's talk about long-term growth expectations over the next three years. From a revenue perspective in 2016, we had identified 6% to 8% we brought that down a percentage 0.5% to 7% and that is going to be probably a little bit more over that three years-maybe a little bit more weighted on the balance sheet size and on the fee base side. Because of things like integrating merchant acquiring into our small business lending and being able to do POS sort of lending capabilities in the future, we think that there is opportunity for growth in that area.\", \"Expenses were guiding to 2% to 4% in the future. Net income at 5% to 7%, which is revised down by percentage point, and earnings per share at 7% to 10%, the lower end being revised down a little bit. Again, this assumed the adoption of CECL, a relatively stable credit environment. And the other thing I would say is that, this isn't what 2020 is going to look like. If you end up thinking about the rate environment that we’re in right now that going to create revenue pressure across the entire industry. So, this is how we think about 21 to 22 kind of that in that timeframe.\", \"Long-term profitability expectations, Andy talked about this earlier, essentially unchanged although we've increased the return on equity target from 13.5% to 16.5%, up to 14.5% to 17.5% range in the future. Again, this assumes the adoption of CECL in the first quarter. From a capital management policy perspective, we're also making some changes relative to 2016. And our capital distributions have been in the high 70s over the course last several years based upon the growth characteristics of risk-weighted assets.\", 'One kind of pointed to the right-hand side of the screen though. One of things that when we think about our capital distribution policy, we really want to be overweighting a little bit more on the dividend side than we have in the past. So, we’ve increased our target payoff for dividends from 30% to 40% up to 35% to 45%. And we’ve decreased a reinvestment in acquisition target from 20% to 40% down to 15% to 35%.', 'What that implies over the course of next three years as we see balance in growth over the kind of next 5% range, if we’re distributing out at that 75% to 80% level. Now, again as we think about our capital level being at 9.6% after CECL, we had the opportunity to be above this range for some period of time. Now I want to leave you with the stuff, Andy started by saying the Company we manage the Company for forever. And it’s important for us to be able to balance both our short term objectives with our long term objectives.', 'Our business mix, and the characteristics of our organization generate consistent, predictable and repeatable earnings, our lower risk profile enables us to be able to manage through a stressful rate environment, stressful environment and the ability to sustain that dividend over a period of time. We have a long track record of been able to generate best-in-class returns. Those returns result in best-in-class growth of our book value per share. And it’s those factors that we believe supports the valuation that we have within the industry and it’s something we’ve earned and something that we’re going to protect overtime.', 'So now, I’d like to just shift gears from the long term expectations so just give you a little bit of update, and in terms of third quarter guidance for our 2019. Generally, we’re reiterating our guidance for the third quarter. However, net interest income will grow but will grow modestly, what we think about our loan growth, our linked quarter loan growth of the third quarter is going to be very similar to the second quarter.', 'At the last earnings call, we had guided that net interest margin was likely to go from a decline 8 to 9 basis points from the second quarter. we actually think, because of the rate environments and the volatilities that’s existed coming down roughly 25 basis points across the curve, so that net interest margin is probably going to decline somewhere between 10 and 11 basis points. Now remind you that, 4 basis points of that decline is related to having the balloon the balance sheet after the European regulatory agencies change some policies related to transitioning deposits between outside of the European Union. And that’s a one-time adios in credit thing, that will impact the third quarter but won’t really carry-over into the fourth quarter.', 'So, and you just have to kind of keep that in mind. From a non-interest income perspective, we continue to guide that non-interest income is going to grow in the mid-single-digits. Although, mortgage banking revenue is likely to be a little stronger than what we had expected and our capital markets business is going to be stronger than what we expected. Keep in mind, both those businesses are commission based type of businesses and so, salary compensation related to that revenue is likely to go up a little bit.', \"For the positive operating leverage perspective that Andy talked about those earlier, we have been guiding to a range of 1% to 1.5% on a full year basis. And because of the interest rate environment, it's likely that we are going to be slightly or somewhat below that range on a full year basis and on a core basis. From a tax rate perspective, we expect the tax rate to be at 20% on a taxable equivalent basis and credit quality continues to be stable.\", 'So thank you very much.', 'Andy Cecere', \"So, we're going to bring all the presenters up on the stage to answer any questions you may have to close it out. And while we gather the chairs, I want you to take a look at this commercial. Kate talked about being there for the moments that matter. Tim talked about centrality. I think this ad represents both of those concepts very well. Why don't you guys come on up?\", '[Audio/Video Presentation]', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'A - Andy Cecere', \"I think that's a terrific ad. I'm going to take it off your inning otherwise they're going to be focused only on that. All right, what can we answer for you? And we have a -- because we're webcast, we have some microphones that will be brought to your table so we can ask the question over the web. While we start with Mike, right up front right now.\", 'Mike Mayo', \"Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security. Andy, we talked a little bit about this. Look, over 10 years best-in-class performance, over 3 years best-in-class performance, today best-in-class debt spreads, but we see other companies going back Sears, Kodak, Xerox within the banking industry, we had legacy Wachovia, legacy JP Morgan great debt spreads, but they didn't evolve. And so what can you do to prevent complacency at your firm? Maybe we can just go down the line and we talk about like the positives? What's the biggest risk to you and each one of you not achieving your objectives?\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Yes, Mike. I'm going to try not to go down the line because it will probably take too much time, but let me give you the essence of the question because we talked a lot about this. And in fact, we were just with our senior managers. We do this once a year with the top 200 managers of the Company. And I actually use that example is that one of my objectives is to not be Sears, Roebuck, right, because we are performing very well. And you're absolutely right. And we perform well for a long time.\", \"But I believe strongly as does this team that we need to pivot in these areas that we've talked about to continue that strength. So, we're not going to lose what got us here, but we have to recognize that we have to change. And I will tell you that this team's all on board, the senior managers at that Denver offsite are on the board, we recognize that. And part of it is the proof is in the pudding in terms of what we've been accomplishing, so not only do we have the belief that we need to change, we are changing in every single way in the way we're delivering the way we're operating, the way we're performing, and the way we're developing. But thanks for the question.\", 'Mike Mayo', '[Indiscernible]?', 'Andy Cecere', \"When I mean by pivot is that keeping those strengths around financial risk discipline, the business makes that we have to be more agile in our approach, more innovative and more digital, and in terms of everything we're doing. Thank you, right there.\", 'John Pancari', \"John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Just a quick question on for Terry on the revenue guidance on the 5 to 7, there still seems a bit aggressive when you look at where you've been running at 3% to 4%, maybe in the previous years, granted different operating environment. But could you just talk about why you believe that 5 to 7 is achievable?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, so, if you think about it, and I talked a little bit about this in my presentation, we think that from a net interest income perspective, that was a little bit subdued because of some of the loan growth issues and some of the portfolios that I ended up talking about. The real question is what happens with respect of fee income? And how does that end up accelerating? And again some of the biggest drags, over the course last three years, has been significant drag related to the mortgage banking revenue and then some of the drag related to a merchant acquiring. And both of those businesses have really shifted they're starting now to accelerate.\", \"And I think it's from a couple of different reasons and some of it is just kind of the macroeconomic environment being a little bit different, but if you heard today from a mortgage banking perspective, we've made some significant investments to shift away from third party correspondence sort of mortgage banking into retail based mortgage banking. The digital app has made a huge difference in terms of being able to capture those applications to be able to kind of get us a closure.\", \"And so, even though the macroeconomic environment right now supports growth, we actually expected before that the mortgage banking revenue to start to accelerate and become not a not a drag, but an opportunity as we thought about the future. If you think about the merchant acquiring space, I think there's a couple of different dynamics. And so, let's talk about the fact that tying that into our banking products and services that's an important part of our strategy. I think about square and other organizations have done some of that, the opportunity from a revenue growth and a balancing growth perspective is significant.\", \"The other thing is that we've been making some significant investments in our payments space. If you think that and if you talked about 5 or 6 acquisitions that we've done over the course last couple of years and product capabilities in terms of integrated software solutions and all sorts of things, and that revenue is now starting to accelerate. We're seeing the sales growth in the 7%, 8%, and 9% within that space. So, we feel pretty confident that part which is a big part of our revenue from a fee perspective is going to be positive.\", 'John Pancari', 'Just one quick follow-up, are you able to break up that 5% to 7% by spreading converses fees?', 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, we ended up talking about that. Here is what I would say is that, I think it's probably a little bit more over weighted and to spread, a little bit under weighted relative to fees, if you're going to come up with that. And again the thinking behind that is because we have some fee-based businesses that we can tie into small business and consumer lending activities, et cetera and again the example that I gave us is the merchant acquiring. We think if that helps to drive loan growth in the future.\", 'Betsy Graseck', \"It's Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Thanks so much for the day. A couple of questions regarding the tailoring rule. So, I think I'll start with Terry, first on, you've mentioned the 10 to 20 billion of liquidity improvement or utilization that you talked about. Could you just give us a sense as to what the dynamic is between that flex point is 10 to 20? What's going to drive the 10 improvement? What's going to drive the 20 improvement?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, they're still trying to decide whether or not we would be subject to kind of the modified LCR or just kind of bringing the LCR requirements down from a 100% to 85%. So, that really kind of helps determine the extent of it.\", 'Betsy Graseck', \"And over what timeframe do you think you'd be able to utilize that?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, I mean, we're hoping and we believe that the tailoring rules what the Fed has said is that they want to be able to adapt those rules by the end of the year. So, it is a part of the next CCAR cycle that means that, it's most likely to be effective sometime in the first quarter. So, from a timing standpoint, and then I think we need to make some decisions as to what do we end up doing. Do we end up selling securities and paying down debt? What do we end up doing we haven't quite decided, but in any of those situations, I think the opportunity for net interest margin expansion exists because of it.\", 'Betsy Graseck', 'And then Andy, could you just give us a sense is to strategically how you think your positioning changes once tailoring rule goes into place?', 'Andy Cecere', \"So, I don't think it changed our investment philosophy and the areas of focus that we talked about. I think that tailoring role in fact it is principally financially in two areas. Number one is the securities portfolio and the amount of liquidity we haven't balance sheet. And number two is the capital component and our ability to manage closer to our target capital levels. In terms of our strategies, in terms of the investments we're making, I don't think there's a lot of impact. Thanks, Betsy.\", 'Erika Najarian', \"Hi, Erika Najarian, Bank of America. This question is for Derek. When we're back here three years from now, what would be the top three accomplishments that you think you could tell us about?\", 'Derek White', \"Thank you for the question. First off that we're a DIY organization where our customers, not just in the retail bank, but across all of our businesses, the four humans can DIY across the bank. Two is that we can visibly demonstrate the power of data and helping those humans makes decisions. And the three that we've built trust with them to where they can trust us to help make decisions on their behalf to create, essentially the self driving bank account.\", 'Terrance Dolan', \"And for we're all wearing jeans. So he's converted. I've taken my tie off right now.\", 'Erika Najarian', \"The second question is a little bit more boring. So in terms of CECL and how we should think about earnings volatility for banks in the next downturn, clearly I think most of the room accepts that U.S. Bank were has a more resilient credit profile. But in theory, given that you're already going to 2% and Jan 1, does that mean that the incremental impact to your earnings is simply due to the increase and charge-offs rather than reserve building as well? Or is the math on CECL in a recession, just way more volatile than we're thinking it's going to be?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"The math is way more volatile when you are thinking is going to be. You won't be able to just look at changes and charge-offs. And the reason for it is about thinking about it, one of the things we end up doing and what the industry is still kind of working through is this idea of having a forward looking view with result of what's going to happen in the economy, which is really hard to do.\", \"So at the end up doing is you end up probability waiting, the likelihood of a recession, first of the recovery, et cetera. When you're moving into a recession, it's going to be, let's say, moderate or hard recession, that probability way it is going to go way up with respect to a recessionary sort of outlook. And that has a multiplying effect with respect to the volatility of the provision that you're going to have to take in that quarter in that year, or whatever might be the case.\", \"And again, this is an industry wide issue that's going to end up existing that is going to create that volatile.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"And to your point, Terry made earlier, not only does it create volatility in the Company, it creates comparability challenges across companies, because each company's making their own economic assumption. So we could be projecting a downturn. Bank A could be projecting stability or actually improvement. And we're going to have very different results. I want to go right here in the front row, table 12.\", 'Saul Martinez', \"Saul Martinez from UBS. The follow-up on credit. How much conservatism are you building into your, through the cycle losses because the 95 to 100 is much higher than what most banks at least are saying, they think they're through the cycle, losses are -- I know there's some mixed element to it, but it is materially higher even within the businesses, or within the lending segments? And how much of that is actually filtering into your CECL calculations because obviously your annual loss rates are a very important input into that? And there is an argument to be made and I know there are a lot safeguards in terms of what you can do in CECL, but there's also a lot of flexibility within the framework. And there's an incentive to reserve as much as they can't be argued that there's an incentive to reserve as much as possible within the contract of CECL to withstand and have some cushion, if things are worse than expected?\", 'Andy Cecere', 'Mark, do you want to address that?', 'Mark Runkel', \"Yes, no, I could go ahead and answer that one on the through the cycle expected loss, I would say there is not. We don't build extra conservatism into that process it's how the portfolios are performed, our underwriting strategies and what our expectations are. As it relates to CECL, what I would say is we use a completely set of different models that we use to be able to look at the portfolios that we use to drive those results. So, they're kind of separate processes, but one does not have more conservatism than the other.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"And one of the reasons for the differences versus other banks Mark is, is our mix of credit card versus thing overall. It's a prime portfolio. It's a wonderful portfolio, but the charge offices are in high 3% to 4%. And that mix, being higher than most other banks and our peer group causes us to be a little higher through the cycle.\", 'Saul Martinez', \"What's your reasonable and affordable for CECL?\", 'Mark Runkel', \"We typically disclose the reasonable. It's typically a three-year time horizon.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Thank you. Right there, then we'll go back there. Okay.\", 'Chris Kotowski', \"Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer. Moving from the accounting to the economic reality, if we could just take a hypothetical, unemployment is currently around four, let's say, it goes to six, and so that's a 50% increase. What would you expect the actual loan losses to do? Would they increase 50%? Would they increase more than 50%? And if you could give it any color on that relative to your expectations on consumer versus commercial loan? And again, assume the slowdowns kind of uniform across the economy just as a simplifying assumptions?\", 'Mark Runkel', \"Yes, with that assumption, what I would say is as run many scenarios, one we run is what is more of a moderate recession, which would be under the CCAR adverse scenario, which unemployment actually goes up to about 7%. We see GDP declining about 4%. Under that scenario, we see our loss rates moving from maybe around that 50 basis points, we're at today, up to closer to 150 to 275 basis points. But I'd say is as when we model it, it's probably on the lower end of that range, but within that range.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"And Chris, you've brought up a good point, everything we're talking about is an accounting change, not an economic change. And so it's not going to change the way we think about underwriting or the portfolio next year, what we have. Because when it comes down, when it is better, it's going to be a lot better evolved from a volatile standpoint. So it's going to be more volatility back and forth. But the economics don't change at all. And we judge and underwrite on economics.\", \"Matt O'Connor\", \"Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. A couple of bigger picture questions, first one M&A, you've talked about evaluating a potential bank deal by whether it makes you a better company looking three to four years out. Maybe collaborate on how you would define what makes USB a better company?\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Yes and I thank for that question because I had a couple of questions at break, I want to clarify something. What I said is we will look less at that time zero impact. I did not mean to imply that we're going to do something hugely diluted, in fact, it was just the opposite. What I meant to say is, given our PE ratio, we could do a lot of creative deals, right. That's not the best way to look at it just because we can do accretion at time zero, we will be better company three years from now and my focus is on that three years from now.\", \"And specific to your question is. Are we going to be better positioned with better capabilities and the scale that's materially different than we are today and against the progress we're making today? So, what that tells you is. We wouldn't do some small transaction that's going to take our eye off the ball and the progress we're making. It has to be material. You have to have the capabilities and/or the product set or the scale and material way.\", 'Mark Runkel', 'And financially beneficial.', 'Andy Cecere', 'And financially beneficial, always financially beneficial.', \"Matt O'Connor\", \"Just a follow-up on the M&A, I think the perception is that you're more open to doing deals now than maybe within the past. And I don't know if that's true or if it's more that you aren't able to deals a couple years ago and that you're always kind of open-minded, but never really anxious...\", 'Andy Cecere', \"It's is a good question and a fair question. We were constrained during the consent tour that we couldn't do M&A. So, we are very limited in the type of M&A we could do, and we have been doing transactions more of a capability transaction as opposed to whole things or traditional transactions. Our consideration is now today, Tim talked about entering new markets in this digital first branch light strategy. We are able to go in new market without buying a high premium deposit base it's going to have run off and then closing the branches and paying up for that and loosing at the zero. So, the financial dynamics that changed a lot, but if it's a material opportunity, we will take a look at it. So, we will low constrain but it's always something we think about.\", \"Matt O'Connor\", \"And then just separate topic, I think one of the challenges for the bank industry right now and how investors, analyst look at it is. The revenue growth outlook is very challenging whether rates goes low, the forward curve or not as bad. It's tough to see whether it's a 5% or 7% or a little bit less. It's a tough revenue outlook out there. The question is. If your ROE is 10, there's not much you can do to choose revenue growth. If your ROE is in the high teens, you can't make a decision to sacrifice in your returns to drive revenue and that's a position that I think clearly you guys are in and want to get your thoughts on potentially sacrificing some of your returns to drive revenue growth?\", 'Andy Cecere', \"We would like to retain those returns in the 14% to 17% range. I think we have opportunities to grow within that return dynamic and if the revenue opportunities less than 5% to 7% that we are projecting, we will manage expenses consistent with the revenue outlook and what we can achieve. We're still focused on that performance in near-term and are investing on the short-term, but will manage for whatever the environment offers us.\", 'Scott Siefers', \"Scott Siefers, Sandler O'Neill. Terry, when you look at the capital targets, the 8.5% common equity Tier 1. Can you discuss for a second just the circumstances under which you do start talking more vocally about the range like the better to manage the 9% now versus 8.5% only because I guess it represents about half of the excess that you have, if you sort of take out that 50 basis point gap?\", 'Terry Dolan', 'Yes. Well, the way we kind of think about it again we have those different objectives, but the 8.5% is really driven based upon when we think about the sustainability through the through the cycle, we think about volatility that could occur on expected certain losses that could occur. To be able to have sufficient capital to be able to absorb that and still be able to sustain our dividend and also start to think. We end up looking at our risk profile, our 8.5% relative to our peer group is really set relative to kind of those peers based upon the risk profile that we have.', \"How we end up making decisions with respect to do we end up managing closer to 9% or 8.5% or whatever is in part driven by currently the fact that we are subject to volatility in the investment portfolio for unrealized gains and losses. And so, we have been running slightly higher than. The other thing is that, we have taken in consideration the credit rating agencies and how they view our risk and what it's going to take in order to maintain that credit rating. And so, we're always an active kind of discussion or dialogue with respect to that in helping to make that decision in terms of where we are going to manage the overall capital level.\", 'Gerard Cassidy', \"Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. When we go back in time and look at the different cycles on credit, it seems like it's always a different area that blows up. 1990, it was the office market. '01 and '02, we had the frauds with WorldCom and Enron. And of course, the subprime was the last one. Can you guys give us some color what you think the next credit -- where you're kind of keeping your eyes extra peeled where we could maybe have some problems?\", 'Andy Cecere', 'Mark, why don’t you start and I will add.', 'Mark Runkel', \"Yes, I would just say, we continue to remain focused on kind of the leverage market and especially a lot of the lending is happening outside of banking system today, right, in the highly leveraged space. So, that's an area that we think potentially could lead to some economic downturn or slowdown and would be some pullback, and we probably see that show up first and maybe some of the consumer portfolios as unemployment begins to rise. And so, we're focusing on both of those areas, but I'm really focused on that leverage market that's again outside of the banking system.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"And probably Mark the second category would be commercial real estate, which is one of the reasons we will be little bit more conservative in that market because we're seeing some structure out there little aggressive.\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, maybe I would add, so the fed has or the regulators in general have been just concerned about looking at lending within the corporate world. And when I say that primarily in that where I would say third tier or fourth tier, middle-market type of corporate America that maybe doesn’t have a same access of capital markets et cetera. Many of them have been leveraging up, and I think that they've been leveraging up, not necessarily through the banking system, but through the shadow banking system. And I think that's an area where they have a concern. The concern maybe from a banking perspective is what sort of spillover effect could that have, if you have stress in that further sector.\", 'Gerard Cassidy', 'And just to pivot on the second question. Obviously, today, you spoke a lot about digitalization. Many of us go to these Investor Days of your peers and they, too, talk about digitalization. So do you look at it as more table stakes, and it really is how you can execute rather than the digitalization itself is the competitive advantage. And then as a tie-in to that, how can a new retail consumer/customer test your app before opening up an account, so that you could then show them that you are better than JP Morgan or better than Bay because, to my knowledge, you really have to have an account open to test those apps?', 'Andy Cecere', \"Derek, why don't you start and Tim add on in the apps? Or Tim's right there.\", 'Derek White', \"Yes, I think we see this the easiest way to articulate is the way I started this morning's that we're excellent on the finance, we're excellent risk management, we have the appetite to be excellent at digital. And the definition of excellence is pretty established based on our financial track record. Digital DIY is absolute table stakes. It's absolutely essential. But I do want to make it very clear. DIY can translate into very positive financial jaws and I that gets into is DIY available. Can you -- how our interactions flowing through in the positive revenue and cost dynamics that flow through that? When it comes to the application itself, we do have demos that are available online for customers to be able to see as well as getting into the application.\", 'Tim Welsh', \"Just to build on that I think as Derek alluded to, the basics of digital will be essential. I mean they'll be table stakes, as you said, Gerard. I do think there are two sources of potential advantage. The first is around personalization that comes from data and you heard some discussion of that already. The second is the ability of the organization to continue to adapt, so how quickly you can implement new innovations is also a key part of the advantage that I think will be built up over time. And on your last point about the app, we actually not only do we have the videos and things that Derek described, but our app is available to prospects, so people -- and that was a strategic choice. So, people can do exactly what you say and test out a little bit.\", 'Ken Usdin', 'Thanks, Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Two questions related to the engines of growth, talked a lot about through the business lines, but when you think about the loan book especially and you look out for the next three year period. What do you see as the best opportunities for growth and return inside the loan book? I’ll start with that one and then come back to the follow-up.', 'Andy Cecere', \"Terry talked a little bit about this and here are some of the business lines, I see a lot of opportunities in many portfolios. So, our auto portfolios are doing wonderfully, our mortgage portfolio, Tim talked about that, which is sale, but we also have it on the books. Their commercial and corporate products I think are strong. We’re in some new areas of growth card. The card portfolio is going to manage. So, the only area that’s lagging a little bit is that CRE area that we talked about as well as the leverage lending, but across the other portfolios, I'm seeing strength across all of them, both in consumer as well as institution.\", 'Ken Usdin', 'So, there’s not like a new or different area where you either are becoming incrementally more focused on and putting more capital to or taking way outside of the ones that you saw?', 'Andy Cecere', 'Yes, small business might be one that we’re going to have more opportunity, and this gets back to the integration of the payments capabilities with the banking capabilities.', 'Ken Usdin', 'And the second thing is that, in the past Investor Days, you have talked about potential growth rates of across the business lines. This year, you’re not giving so much specific color, but can you help us understand, what is anything different versus last time? Do you think that there’s a relatively stronger engine of growth versus one that’s a little softer just because of the prospects of the secular growth that’s available? Thanks.', 'Terry Dolan', 'So, let me just kind of start. So, we end up thinking about the various lines of business from a revenue growth point of view. I would say that the characteristics of slightly bringing down our overall targets, is really kind of cast across all of those lines of businesses a bit. I would say that again, we tend to think that the payments space has and the wealth management space has a little bit higher growth sort of opportunities in the future relative to the other ones. But that’s very consistent with what we’ve shown in the past.', 'Andy Cecere', 'And also say, one of the thoughts is, we talked a lot about this concept through one U.S. Bank and this integration across business lines, so take it a small business version opportunity. It is an opportunity for a multiple business lines. So as we think about where the roads are going to come, it’s going to come in many places, so we wanted to think about in a one U.S. Bank way.', 'Vivek Juneja', \"If rates, as you’re thinking about your long-term growth rates, if rates stay low for an extended period of time, what does that do to your timeframe for achieving those growth rates for one? For a second, it sounds like you’re factoring in that’s up 2020, at least mortgage banking is a big driver, you probably got some benefits from the LCR tailoring rules, so that gives you a lift up. But ones those are done, if you can read that thinking also into your longer term what's a…\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Yes, and it’s obviously, that question is really hard to answer simply because I have no idea where rates are going to go from one week to the next as opposed to 2020 to 2021. But I think just kind of making an assumption that, rates are going to be lower and the yield will be flat or at least through 2020. I think that creates a revenue challenge, leads to 2020. But then, I think that tends to stabilize and they have underlying fundamentals of the growth of the book of business is what’s I put an end up driving net interest income kind of going forward from there, and that’s so many things stay stabilize relative to where they're today.\", 'Vivek Juneja', \"And Terry and Andy, as we've done look out say a year or two out, even three years out of the next Investor Day. Given that you’re expecting loan growth from some of these small businesses, payments related initiative to pick up, LCR, tailoring to help on the NII. What should we expect the mix up NII to fee revenues to start to look like?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"It's roughly 42% today. And as we kind of think about out three years, just based upon kind of our senses, we expect that it's going to stay fairly close to that going out into the three years sort of time horizon.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"I agree with that. The one caveat that I would give you Vivek is that, what I think is going to also change in the industry is the way we're paid for the value we deliver. And the traditional spread on the balance sheet component and the fee component may adjust overtime as we think about things like real time payments, and treasury management, compensating balance pieces like. So we'll get revenue, but it may be in different buckets that we're through versus what we're traditionally thinking about.\", 'John McDonald', \"Hi, John McDonald from Autonomous. I wanted to ask about the operating leverage dynamics and Terry maybe a near-term question and Andy longer term. Terry, for the near term, I think it's understandable that it's a little tougher to get to that goal for the year, given the rate environment. I guess, is that, what change in your equation, you did 98 basis points operating leverage in the first half. So you're kind of expecting some things to get better in the second half, just maybe a little bit of color there. And then Andy longer term, how did you come over that 1 to 1.5 for this year. Is that kind of a longer term goal? Could you see that evolving differently over time and be helpful?\", 'Terry Dolan', \"Yes, so if you look at the first half of the year, we're basically at 1%. So that 1.0, and if you remember, at the end of the second quarter, we just said. From the time we set that guide to the end of the second quarter, that guide was really set in September or December of the year, and of course, the yield curve flattened for a moment. You can manage, I think through some of that, but at some point in time, you have to make that decision between short-term and long-term.\", \"And then the other thing is that when is happening in September, the levers that you might be able to pull relative to the year are just difficult to be able to both execute and see the benefit of within a relatively short period of time. So we have to kind of take that into consideration, again, when we think about, where the yield curve is today. And I know John's turns here. So, that might be different about 10 minutes from now. But in terms of where it's at today, I think it's going to be somewhat lower than that 1%. But we're going to do everything we can to manage the expenses, the way that we know we can.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Our timing is impeccable, September 12, the paper Investor Day, right. So 60 days ago around July in the earnings call, we expected the 1 to 150. And in the subsequent 45 days, race went down 50 to 60 basis points. We went from one rate increase decline expectation to three, right? And all that, so we're doing all the modeling and then in the last week, the 10-year goes up 20, right? So obviously, it's changing dramatically as we speak, right? So we're always trying to achieve that positive opportunity.\", \"As we talked about, John, I think we have a lot of opportunities in the Company, while retaining the investments as necessary for success in the future to optimize what we're doing today. So I'm very confident and positive offering leverage. And I think that range is the opportunity that we have on a go forward basis.\", 'Terry Dolan', \"And I would come back to one of the questions that was earlier and that is. If you don't make the investments in your business to evolve, you're going to find yourself at the valley of death. And we need to make sure that we are making investments to digitize and move this organization forward. So that gets back to the balance of making some maybe some decisions that are going to benefit us in the long-term. And again, where the yield curve ends up who knows, but we're just going to end up having to manage whatever comes at us.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Mike, she's coming right behind you.\", 'Mike Mayo', \"Well, I sent a text to my wife and I asked her, she -- we're in the New York City. Have you heard of U.S. Bank and what do you think your answer was.\", 'Terry Dolan', 'Is she football fan?', 'Mike Mayo', \"She now watches football. But she said, why are you bothering me? But she hasn't heard of it. And so, I guess the question here is, as you move out of market in retail, half the country don't have branches. I'm not, I don't feel too nervous saying three years from now I don't think you're out of market retail expansions going to make a big dent in your firm. And if that's the case then how can you look at customers for lifetime value the same way some of the largest banks can? As you can't look at your customers for total lifetime value, we put this in our preview report, I'm raised in Cincinnati, I go to school, watch you in St. Louis, I moved to Milwaukee, I then get married and moved to New York City and I'm not doing with U.S. Bank anymore. So some of your larger banks can do that, you might not be able to do the same way. Therefore, doesn't that change the way you think about bank acquisitions? And as another thing is, what is your retention rate these days with your retail customers say over decades?\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Kate, why don't you start on the brands? And Tim, talk about retail customers and I'll close it out.\", 'Kate Quinn', \"Sure. And of course, we are you're right, there are many people that have not heard of U.S. Bank that haven't been exposed to the brand. However, we're being really smart about how we acquire customers out of footprint. So for example, and I think to mention this, we have hundreds of thousands of customers outside of our retail footprint that may have a mortgage with us or credit card with us and what we have been doing is doing tests to understand okay, well, what other rights we have to that customer for example.\", \"How do we groom them to be a broader U.S. Bank customer and we've been very successful in some of those pilots. So, we're getting smarter and smarter about how we do it, how we optimize it with the data and insights that we have. I also think that there are many examples of now through digitization and other product improvements that we can move across geographic geographies, and we are working on many, many other initiatives that enable us to have sort of ubiquitous capabilities versus being married to our geography.\", 'Tim Welsh', \"And I'd just add a couple of points. I think to that Mike the first is that, as Kate alluded to, we do have customers all across the country and we are demonstrating the ability to particularly through digital tools serve them in multiple ways. That's one of the real benefits for example having mortgage servicing as part of our app, someone who was mortgage servicing customer actually download the app, but to George question can actually see all the different parts and offerings that we have and that turns out to be a terrific tool, if by the way does solve your Washington University student problem because they move from geographies and keeps the same app. And so that's a big part of it.\", \"And you're right, that we will need to guild branches as we've indicated we will in some high profile markets to build some more awareness, but we're seeing very strong retention of our customers and we're seeing a real openness to the kind of offering that we have in part because the digitization is good and in part because they're seeing our credit card auto or mortgage experience be pretty positive and that opens them up to other possibilities that they may have with the bank.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"I'd add one thing to it because we try to enter new markets in a digital only, no brand new customer basis and we actually got was negative selection, we got either customers who we had to pay very high rates to attract as there's nothing else attracting the U.S. Bank and/or they weren't able to bank other banks. This concept of these customers are already have U.S. Bank in your wallet one way shape or form and expanding the relationships across the markets that we have branches and don't have branches and sometimes they have branches in this digital first branch life strategy, I think is the right way to go.\", 'Mike Mayo', \"And do you have figures on retail customer retention? And how does that change this decade or over decades because that's the dream, right that you can hold these customers for life? Are you actually seeing that in the data? And how does your data compare to industry data?\", 'Tim Welsh', \"What we've looked at over a long time, and I'm not sure I can comment on the industry, but for ourselves. When we look at this concept of centrality that we talked about, which is a combination of are we your primary bank, are you engaging with us a lot and do we have a broad relationship with you? When we look at those customers, they are substantially more profitable, and they have much higher retention than a typical customer. And that's why we're so focused on that metric and moving that number.\", 'Andy Cecere', \"Other questions? All right, well, why don't I -- thank you. Thank you for your questions. And thank you again for your attendance. Why don't I close it out with just a few remarks? So, we started the day and talking about the three components of how we want you to think about the Company. Number one, we're starting from a position of strength. We have a lot of capabilities and core competencies that is our intent to retain. But at the same time, we recognize that we need to adjust and pivot for some of those new capabilities around agile, innovation and digital.\", 'When you saw a number of business line initiatives that take that into account. And we talked about the business mix we have the high return businesses, the capital efficiency that we have industry returns and industry leading risk management.', \"Importantly, throughout the day and back to some of the questions were asked just now, we recognize that we need to change, retain what we're strong at, but adjusting change for the future. And that in, that requires investments to require an attitude of adoption and agility and requires us recognize that we need to do things differently. And the way we're thinking about this is optimizing today, recognizing those things that we can get better at to continue to invest in the future.\", \"Now, the thing I didn't talk about this morning is what gives me the most confidence is a team up here on the stage. I think we have the best leaders in banking. I think we have the best business leaders, the best risk leaders and the best finance leaders. And I couldn't be more proud of what they accomplished thus far. So I'll leave you with this thought, we're managing for the long-term, while delivering near-term results to support a pathway to the future.\", \"If your investor in U.S. Bank, thank you. I'm confident your investment as well placed. Thank you for your time today and thanks for the questions. Have a good day.\"], ['Mereo BioPharma Group plc (NASDAQ:MREO) 2019 Interim Financial Results and Corporate Update Conference Call September 17, 2019  8:00 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Richard Jones – Chief Financial Officer', 'Denise Scots-Knight – Chief Executive Officer', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Brian White – Cantor Fitzgerald', 'Zoe Karamanoli – RBC Capital Markets', 'Mick Cooper – Trinity Delta', 'Operator', 'Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Mereo BioPharma 2019 Interim Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.', 'It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Richard Jones, Chief Financial Officer of Mereo BioPharma. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Richard Jones', 'Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and good afternoon to those of you in the UK. And thank you for joining us on our 2019 interim financial results and corporate update conference call.', 'Earlier today we issued a press release providing an overview of the company’s financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This press release, along with a few slides that you may find helpful while you listen to this call may be accessed on the investor portion of our website at www.mereobiopharma.com.', 'Leading the call today will be Dr. Denise Scots-Knight, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a summary of our recent clinical and corporate developments. Afterwards, I will provide an overview of the financial highlights for the six months ended June 30, 2019. We will then open the line for any questions.', 'As a reminder, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our assumptions as of the current date and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. We caution you to consider the important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, in the press release, and this conference call.', 'These risk factors are described in today’s press release, as well as in Slide 1 and are more fully detailed under the caption, risk factors in the filings with the SEC.', 'In addition, please note the date of this conference call is September 17, 2019. And any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.', 'I will now turn the call over to Denise.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Thank you, Richard. Good morning everyone and good afternoon to those of you in the UK. And thank you for joining us today. The first half of 2019 was an exciting period for Mereo during which we made significant progress against our strategic priorities. These advancements has set the stage for an important cadence of events to take place in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, including our anticipated data readouts from our two lead rare disease programs in osteogenesis imperfecta and severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.', 'Before I review a number of important highlights and updates across our product portfolio, let me first begin with a brief reminder of our core strategy and summary of our broader accomplishments with context. For those of you following along with the slide deck, I’m now on Slide 2. In just a few short years since Mario’s founding in 2015, we have assembled a diversified portfolio of novel therapeutic candidates that have already received significant investment from major pharmaceutical companies focusing on bone, respiratory, and endocrine indications with each having Phase 2 data in the indication we are developing or in a related indication.', 'We’ve successfully completed two large randomized Phase 2 studies in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which both met their respective primary endpoints and are ready for the next stages of development. We’ve also secured multiple regulatory designations and initiated substantial Phase 2 clinical studies in the orphan diseases osteogenesis imperfecta and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, both of which currently have no or limited treatment options available. And finally, earlier this year we completed a merger transaction with OncoMed acquiring two additional clinical stage oncology programs, navicixizumab and etigilimab or anti-TIGIT resulting in our current diversified portfolio of six mid to late stage clinical programs.', 'Well, these are all significant steps and we’re proud of our accomplishments. We believe these are just the beginning. Our goal is to build Mereo into a leading fully integrated rare disease company. We believe we’re on the cusp of significant value inflection points with our two lead rare disease assets. Setrusumab for osteogenesis imperfecta or OI and our view is that for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD. As such, I will spend most of today’s call discussing these two programs.', 'Now turning to Slide 3, our lead rare disease product candidate setrusumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin. We believe this mechanism is particularly well suited to treat OI, because unlike other agents, which are either anabolic or anti-resorptive. Setrusumab has been demonstrated to be a strong bone building agent that also reduces the resorption of bone, creating a dual-action anabolic effect to build overall bone density.', 'For background OI also known as brittle bone disease is a rare genetic disease, which causes a collagen defect.', 'It is characterized by fragile bones that fracture easily as well as variety of other physical symptoms that can severely impact patient’s life and quality of life. There are currently no FDA or EMA approved therapies for the OI. The disorder is particularly devastating for children and for their families and has a significant impact on the quality of life for adult patients who also fracture and very often suffer chronic pain.', 'In recognition of this unmet need setrusumab has received prime designation by the European Medicines Agency and has also been granted orphan status by both the EMA and the FDA. In May of this year, we announced encouraging six-month data from the open-label arm of our ongoing Phase 2b dose ranging ASTEROID clinical study, which is summarized here on Slide 4 along with the design of the study.', 'As a reminder, the primary endpoint of ASTEROID is the percentage change over baseline in trabecular volumetric bone mineral density Tr vBMD the wrist at 12 months, assessed using High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography or HR-pQCT. The time of the interim data cutoff 12 patients had Tr vBMD measurements at the radius or the wrist available at baseline and three months. And 11 of these patients had measurements available at baseline and six months.', 'Patients showed a mean increase from baseline of 1.4% at three months and 3.2% at six months. We believe that these increases compare very favorably to the increases in Tr vBMD at the radius in osteoporosis patients. Approximately 1% at 24 months with alendronate, and approximately 1% and 1.5% at 12 months observed with teraparitide or denosumab, respectively.', 'Change from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine, as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry or DXA, is a key secondary point of the ASTEROID study. In the open label arm, at the time of the interim data cut-off, there were 12 patients whose areal BMD at the lumbar spine DXA measurements at baseline and six months were available. These showed a mean increase of 3.5% over baseline. These data confirms the previous data generated by Novartis before we acquired setrusumab and also compares favourably with other mechanisms of action in adult OI patients who were treated with PTH, where changes of 2.2% were seen at six months.', 'We’re delighted that the six months data from our ASTEROID study were selected for late-breaking oral presentation at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research 2019 Annual Meeting in Orlando later this week, which we believe shows clear peer recognition and underscores the potential of setrusumab to become an effective treatment option for OI. The presentation will take place on Friday, September 20, at 3:45 PM Eastern Time.', 'The ASTEROID study remains ongoing, patients enrollments is complete and we continue to expect the top line 12 months data on the remaining three blinded-dose ranging arms of the study to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019. As we described in our open label data announcement, the 112 patients enrolled into the four arms of the study includes 69 patients with type 1 OI, 28 with type 4 and 15 with type 3.', 'In Q4, we expect to report on the primary endpoint of the study percentage change over baseline in Tr vBMD the rest at 12 months using HRpQCT and also the key secondary endpoints including changes in BMD measured by DXA and overall safety data. I want to note also that ASTEROID is the largest investigational clinical study that has ever been conducted in adult OI patients in the U.S. and EU. And we anticipate that this study will provide us with additional insights into this debilitating disease.', \"Turning now to Slide 5. In addition to evaluating setrusumab in adult OI patients, our pediatric investigational plan or PIP has been approved by the EMA and a study design has been agreed for a pivotal registration trial in children, which will be based on a primary endpoint of fractures over a 12 month period. The trial will be conducted in approximately 165 children with severe disease age 5 to 18 years old with OI types 1, 3 and 4. We also intend to validate the use of HRpQCT as a predictive biomarker in this study. This is a key step in our plan to commercialize the setrusumab in both children and adults. We're also exploring the extension of this pediatric study into the U.S. as well as the EU and Canada and look forward to updating you on that in due course.\", \"Our team has been focused on further interactions with European agencies in respect of our setrusumab program, including submitting our action plan to marketing authorization to the EMA, and initiation of scientific advice, discussions regarding the potential regulatory qualification of HRpQCT as a biomarker. We've also engaged with the EUnetHTA groups representing the European Health Technology Assessment bodies and held several meetings with pricing and reimbursement authorities under the mechanism of coordinated access to offer medicinal product scheme in the EU.\", 'We continue close collaborations with KOLs and the treating community, and most recently we participated in the International Conference on Children’s Bone Health, which has an increased focus on rare bone conditions and potential future therapies. In addition, we continued to develop, build and maintain close relationships with OI patient representative groups in the EU and U.S., systematically involving them in our interaction with the authorities.', 'Now turning to our second lead rare disease program Alvelestat on Slide 6. We continued to enroll severe AATD patients in the U.S. and EU in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. Alvelestat is a small molecule that inhibits neutrophil elastase called NE. NE is an enzyme that attacks and progressively damages lung tissue.', 'AATD patients either lack the protective alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, or produce abnormal ineffective protein that cannot block NE destruction. Such patients suffer progressive lung deterioration, leading to cough, wheeze, COPD-like symptoms and, ultimately, reliance on respiratory support. Some patients go on to receive lung transplants.', 'The primary endpoint for our 12-week proof-of-concept study is based on the biomarker desmosine, which is a breakdown product of elastin, the target of NE. If the results demonstrate a positive impact on the blockade of NE, we intend to seek regulatory advice in both the EU and the U.S. on the design of a pivotal study in both territories and to commence this as soon as possible thereafter.', 'The only approved therapy for AATD is plasma-derived protein. However, this is not reimbursed and is not available for use in all territories. We expect top line data from this study in mid-2020, as a result of slower than anticipated study startup and hence slower patient enrollment timelines.', 'Due to lack of broadly available therapies, AATD is often underdiagnosed or may be treated with off-label therapies provide, approved with COPD patients, but they do not treat the underlying pathology of the disease. Availability of approved new therapeutic options is expected to increase awareness and diagnosis both amongst treating physicians and in the patient community alike. As in OI, we continue to develop, build and maintain close relationships with the KOLs, the treating community, and the AATD patient representative organizations in both the EU and North America.', 'In addition, as part of our broader development plans for alvelestat are looking to build on our respiratory pipeline, we’re continuing to support certain investigator-led studies, including the ATALANTA study into AATD led by Mark Dransfield and his team, financially supported by an NCATS grant and also a study into bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or BOS associated with graft-versus-host disease, GvHD in patients receiving hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is led by Steve Pavletic at the NIH.', 'BOS is an orphan disease characterized by inflammatory obstruction of the lungs tiniest airways, and is the primary cause of death in patients, who receive lung transplants. Given the preliminary clinical data to-date, we are planning to further investigate the use of alvelestat to treat BOS patients following lung transplantation. It is estimated that there are approximately three and a half thousand lung transplants in the U.S. each year and roughly, 50% of this population develop BOS.', 'Slide 7 again, summarizes upcoming milestones and key recent progress including our broader pipeline beyond our lead rare disease assets, which consists of four additional clinical stage product candidates; acumapimod for the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; leflutrozole for the treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, HH in obese men; navicixizumab for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and etigilimab for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.', 'A few brief highlights across these programs. leflutrozole and acumapimod are ready for the next stages of development. Regarding the latter, we had a successful type B end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA earlier this year and agreed on an outline for a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial program.', 'Our positive Scientific Advice Working Party or SAWP meeting also took place recently with the EMA. In July, we held a successful type B end of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA regarding the potential pathway for accelerated approval for navicixizumab, which was lead OncoMed asset for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We discussed with the FDA and agreed with in principle on an outline for the design of a phase 2 clinical trial that could potentially support the accelerated approval of navicixizumab.', 'Our team remains focused on advancing discussions with potential partners to help us further realize the value of these assets and we look forward to updating you regarding these discussions in the future. In addition to the progress have highlighted regarding our development programs, we also continue the build out of our senior Management Team and board of directors to ensure that we have the necessary expertise and are well positioned as our programs continue to advance. Last month we announced the appointment of Richard Francis as Head of Pharmaceutical Development. And this week Dr. Arun Mistry is joining us as the Therapeutic Area Head for Setrusumab. Following completion of the merger with OncoMed, Mike Wyzga, and Dr. Deepa Pakianathan were appointed as Non-Executive Directors to the Mereo Board.', 'I’ll now turn the call back to Richard, who will provide a summary of our interim financial highlights.', 'Richard Jones', 'Thank you, Denise. For those of you following along I’m now on Slide 8, which summarizes our key financial highlights. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 R&D expenditure rose by £1 million to £11.9 million from £10.9 million for the same period in 2018. In 2019, we continue the development of our two rare disease assets, setrusumab and alvelestat with R&D expenditure relating to the adult Phase 2b study and associated manufacturing cost for setrusumab on the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for alvelestat.', 'During the six months ended June 30, 2019 our administrative expenses reduced by £0.6 million to £6.5 million from £7.1 million for the same period in 2018. These costs included several IFRS non-cash adjustments and other costs of a one-off nature. On a non-GAAP basis, therefore, our underlying administrative expenses in the period were £4.9 million compared to £3.8 million in 2018. And these included £1.3 million relating to the OncoMed Pharmaceutical subsidiary from completion of the merger in April, 2019 to the end of the period.', 'We started the year with £25 million in cash in short-term deposits and £2.5 million of short-term investments or total cash resources of £27.5 million. In April, 2019 we acquired $50.8 million of cash resources with the completion of the merger with OncoMed Pharmaceuticals. After taking account of costs associated with the merger and our operating costs in the period, net cash inflow in the first half of 2019 was £3.3 million, with cash and short-term deposits at the period end of £28.3 million. Taking into account an increase in short-term investments of £5.3 million, our total cash resources increased £8.6 million to £36.1 million', 'Now we’d like to turn the call back over to the operator to see if there are any questions. Operator?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.', 'Brian White', 'Yes, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions on setrusumab from me. I don’t know if this one is relevant or not, but I’d ask anyway just in terms of the data that we’re going to see in Q4 are you able to break down the impact by Type OI patient i.e. case I, III and IVand depending on those data, would that have an influence on the recruitment into the Phase 3 pediatrics study? That’s the first question.', 'The second one is just along the lines of thinking about the primary endpoint in ASTEROID and how representative that would be in terms of our thinking about the potential answer for the fracture study in the pediatric indication. Thanks.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', \"Great. Okay. Thanks for your questions, Brian. I'll try to remember them. So the first one, are we going to see the breakdown by OI Types.\", \"We are collecting the data by OI Type. So we do hope to give an indication of the – if there are different levels of responses by OI Type. And I think that, in the open label data, we only had one, in the data that we reported we only had one Type III patient and one Type IV patient. So obviously in that case we didn't break the data down, but in the full dataset we should have sufficient numbers to see if there are any trends at least.\", \"The other thing I think that's relevant to that question is I’ve mentioned that we are gaining more insights into the disease and the patient's experience of this disease through the ASTEROID study. And we're quite often told that, and this is relevant to the pediatric study as well. We're quite often told that, Type I patients are mild and they don't fracture very much.\", \"And what we're finding through the ASTEROID study is, that's quite a way too much of a general statement. And we've come across Type I patients who have had 30, 40 fractures during their lifetime.\", \"So the classification I think by phenotype, the boundary is a not quite as black and white as you might think from reading the literature. So that leads me into the, you mentioned will it be results from the ASTEROID study impact our pediatric study. Obviously we will have some dosing information, in terms of the changes in HR-pQCT. And the other thing is that, we're focusing on the higher fracturing patients in the pediatric study, there is a publication out this year actually that looks at different HR-pQCT parameters and shows in a [indiscernible] analysis of about 7,500 patients, correlation of propensity to fracture with some of the parameters in HR-pQCT.\", 'So it hopefully will provide some supporting evidence going into the pediatric study.', 'Brian White', \"Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Zoe Karamanoli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.', 'Zoe Karamanoli', 'Hi. I have two questions one of them has been answered also about the Type I, Type III, and Type IV. So my second question is on the potential partnering discussion in leflutrozole with – I am wondering if you could give us some more background as to the reasons for when your ad board that you’ve decided to focus development on male fertility? And what does this mean with regards to potential future partnering discussion?', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Okay. Thanks for your questions Zoe. So in the ad board, I think the focus in terms of the fertility was that they were very – to date the ad board was very impressed with the improvements in fertility that we saw in the study. In particular, obviously we significantly increased the hormones of fertility FH and LH, but also that translated into a biological effect in terms of the sperm counts. And so, we felt that that’s a real differentiation on a real angle for the product. So that’s why we are focusing on that. The next steps in terms of partnering are the – we are looking now for this regulatory pathway. So we need to understand the clear regulatory pathway as part of the partnering discussion.', 'Zoe Karamanoli', 'Okay, great. Thank you.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Mick Cooper with Trinity Delta. Your line is open.', 'Mick Cooper', 'Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have – just a few follow-up questions. Following from your reply to Brian about the design and the learnings from the setrusumab, are you looking at – if it can be a simple division, are you going to have to allow to get a properly balanced trial given the variability that you’re seeing within the patients. Are you going to have patients allocated balanced according to the – their bone density? Or is it going to be simply according to the type of OI that they have? And second question with alvelestat, am I right in thinking that now that the start of the programs they have just had these study centers up and running, that the recruitment is now going as expected?', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Okay.', 'Mick Cooper', 'And finally, can you give us any more color on how the discussions are going, the partnering discussions, are going with any of the other assets?', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Okay. All right, so I’ll start with alvelestat, because that’s a very simple answer. So, yes, we’re now sort of on part of the enrollment curve. These things always go exponentially. So we are on the part of the enrollment curve where we expected to be, which is why we’re guiding to mid-2020. So hopefully that answers that question Mick.', 'Mick Cooper', 'Yes.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'In terms of the design for – and I assume you’re talking about the pediatric study.', 'Mick Cooper', 'Exactly.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Yes. So what we’ll do, because obviously we’re going to have the data from the adult study before we start the pediatric study in earnest. So, we’re going to take the learnings from that in terms of types of OI and as you mentioned BMD. So we’ll very much learn from what we see in ASTEROID. At the moment in terms of how we with ASTEROID with more by type. But we will obviously see there’s an impact in terms of starting BMD.', 'Mick Cooper', 'Okay.', 'Denise Scots-Knight', \"Okay, and then in terms of partnering on the other assets. So I've mentioned Leflutrozole, so in terms of Acumapimod, the discussions there really at the moment are around the regulatory feedback that we have and the fact that we have now a phase – we've got a Phase 3 design, I've got a pivotal study design. However, the endpoint for that pivotal study is one that was not the – it's a different primary endpoint obviously from our Phase 2 study. And so we're having discussions with partners about how to de-risk that, that’s the stage of those discussions. And then with navi we have really just started the partnering in earnest having just got the FDA feedback and we're getting some very good traction there obviously with having a pathway to potential accelerated approval.\", 'Mick Cooper', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', \"Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions. So I’ll now turn the call back over to Dr. Denise Scots-Knight, CEO for closing remarks.\", 'Denise Scots-Knight', 'Thank you. So I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us on the call today. We all appreciate as always your interest in Mereo and your question.', \"Let me just close by reiterating that the next quarter of 2019 is set to be a pivotal period for Mereo, following our announcement to the initial six-month open label data for Setrusumab and OI in May. We very much look forward to reporting the 12-month complete dose ranging data on all the patients enrolled into the blinded part of the study in this fourth – coming fourth quarter. We're also keen to initiate our pivotal pediatric study in OI patients in the EU and Canada, and look forward to exploring extension of our pediatric study into the U.S. Thank you.\", 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.'], ['Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOG) Q2 2020 Earnings Conference Call September 17, 2019  9:00 AM ET', 'Company Participants', 'Joseph Puishys - CEO', 'James Porter - EVP and CFO', 'Jeff Huebschen - VP, IR & Communications', 'Conference Call Participants', 'Chris Moore - CJS Securities', 'Eric Stine - Craig-Hallum', 'Julio Romero - Sidoti & Company', 'Jon Braatz - Kansas City Capital', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Apogee’s Fiscal 2020 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].', 'I will now like to turn the conference over to speaker today, Jeff Huebschen. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Jeff Huebschen', \"Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Apogee Enterprises fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Joe Puishys, Apogee's Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Porter, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind everyone that there are slides to accompany today's remarks, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.\", 'During this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures is provided in the earnings release we issued this morning, which is also available on our Web site.', \"I'd like to remind everyone that our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management's expectations, which are based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect Apogee's business and financial results can be found in our SEC filings.\", \"And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Joe.\", 'Joseph Puishys', 'All right. Thanks, Jeff, and thank you to everyone who has joined us this morning. Overall, this was another solid quarter for Apogee. We delivered on our commitments and made very good progress in a number of areas.', 'This morning, I’d like to discuss the highlights in the quarter and the trends we are seeing across our businesses, talk about the progress we’re making on several key initiatives to advance our long-term strategy, and then I’ll turn it over to Jim for more details on the quarter and our guidance.', 'Regarding the second quarter, highlights, and trends, let me start by saying first we made significant progress toward completing the last of the legacy EFCO projects that we acquired. We’re on track with our schedule and cost estimates. We expect the building will be largely enclosed by the end of October, and as is extremely normal for large construction projects, we will have residual activity that will stretch over the next few quarters.', 'We’re also continuing to pursue potential cost recoveries, some of which we could see later in the second half of this fiscal year. More broadly in Architectural Framing Systems, we are encouraged by the trend line in this segment with sequential revenue growth and margin improvement in each of the past few quarters, in spite of incurring costs associated with the supply chain synergy project I’ll discuss shortly.', 'In particular, the EFCO business is starting to demonstrate its long-term potential performing nicely in the quarter and year-to-date. The EFCO team has made significant progress increasing productivity, quality, controlling its costs and improving pricing. Later in my commentary, I’ll speak more about some strategic moves we’ve made to drive further progress in margin expansion in our Framing Systems segment.', 'Architectural Glass has delivered 13% sales growth and more than tripled operating income compared to last year’s second quarter. While the segment certainly had a modest comparison, we’re pleased with the substantial year-over-year improvement. This year-over-year margin gain would have been even better if not for the start-up costs related to our Architectural Glass growth initiative which reduced segment margins by about 100 basis points in this quarter. We’re excited about this opportunity, and I’ll provide more details about this investment in a few moments.', 'Our Glass segment has also seen some negative impact from the stronger U.S. dollar. This is something that is affecting most U.S. manufacturing companies. Over the past year, the dollar has steadily strengthened versus other currencies. This disadvantages our U.S.-based glass operations and increases competitive intensity, particularly from European competitors. For this reason, we’re reducing our full-year outlook for Architectural Glass and we will continue to monitor changes in the competitive environment.', 'In Architectural Services, while we anticipated that revenues would be lower this quarter, due solely to timing of projects in the backlog, the segment performed better than we expected driven by strong project execution at the construction site. Based on year-to-date results, we’re increasing our full year outlook for Architectural Services.', 'In addition, the Services segment was awarded several new projects during the quarter pushing its backlog to over $500 million. This record backlog further increases our confidence in the longer-term outlook for this segment and gives us good line of sight to revenues over the next two fiscal years.', 'Finally, in Large Scale Optical, we continue to deliver strong operational performance improving on its impressive operating margins. In particular, our team has had great success in improving our mix to higher value-added products, which has benefitted both revenues and margins. So overall, a solid quarter and we feel very confident about how we’re positioned for the remainder of the year.', 'I’ll now provide my view of the end markets. Looking at the conditions in the economy and our end markets, all of you see the same headlines I see; so it’s hard to argue that there is not some uncertainty in the economy. In spite of the headlines, we still see reasonably healthy bidding activity. It continues to feel like we’re bumping along the top, an environment in which Apogee can continue to grow.', 'Based on U.S. government data, while this economic expansion is the longest since World War II, it has also been the weakest of the 11 recoveries, and overall building in the non-resi sector has remained below prior recoveries. The office sector, which is most important to us, remains strong as does healthcare and education, also key to our portfolio.', 'Office vacancy rates are at decade plus low levels as is rental rates as they come down – or as they are rising, I apologize, and consumer spending and job growth remained reasonably strong. Bottom line is that the non-resi market appears to remain balanced as the U.S. economy continues to migrate from manufacturing to services; that mix works in our favor.', 'Looking back at our company, the project wins we’ve had in Architectural Services as well as our pipeline reinforce our confidence and validate that aspects of the commercial construction market are not in decline, and I expect we could see further backlog growth in Services in the third quarter.', 'As I mentioned earlier, our biggest economic concern right now is the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar which we continue to monitor. Looking at our strategy and initiatives to drive growth and margin expansion, regardless of what’s going on in the economy and our end markets, we are focused on managing what we can control to better position the company for long-term earnings growth and more consistent performance throughout the economic cycle.', 'We’ve had a lot of success executing our strategy over the past eight years, and Apogee is clearly a stronger company than it was in fiscal 2012. We’ve diversified our product and project mix both within each of our segments and across the company. We’ve expanded the growth opportunities available to the company through new product innovation and geographic expansion, and we’ve improved the efficiency and productivity of our operations. I’m confident this strategy is still the right direction for Apogee.', 'Over the past several quarters, we’ve had some near-term challenges, most of which are behind us, but throughout this time we’ve not been sitting still. We’ve been moving forward with a number of initiatives to advance our strategy. Let me provide some detail on these.', 'First, we continue to believe our Framing Systems segment has the largest opportunities for long-term growth and margin expansion as well as stability throughout an economic cycle. We’ve had success and we are accelerating our efforts.', 'Towards that end we recently created and appointed a new leadership team so that for the first time we’ll have combined P&L responsibility for our entire Framing Systems segment, which is previously operating as six independent businesses. This new leadership team under the command of a proven P&L leader that I brought into the company a year and a half ago is focused on accelerating our progress by increasing integration and driving synergies across all of our Framing Systems businesses.', 'For example, during the quarter, we took initial steps to increase supply chain integration and optimize our facility footprint by closing a manufacturing facility and shifting production to other Apogee locations. Additionally in Framing Systems, we completed a significant facility investment at our main EFCO operations center this quarter designed to streamline the processes for handling and shipping finished goods to enable further shop floor efficiency improvements. This investment is already having a positive impact on EFCO’s productivity, quality and margins.', 'The past two quarters we’ve mentioned a growth initiative in our Architectural Glass segment that we would like to provide some additional details on today. We’ve invested in a new facility located in Texas which we will expect to be operational in our fiscal third quarter. This facility will be focused on the short lead time segment of the Architectural Glass market.', 'While our Viracon glass business is the established leader in mid and large-sized projects, this facility marks our entrance into a portion of the market in which Apogee has not historically participated. As short lead time smaller projects comprised the largest sub-segment of the overall Architectural Glass market, we believe this expansion offers significant long-term growth potential in all phases of the economic cycle.', 'This new facility will also supply some of the glass needs of our Framing Systems segment generating further synergies across our portfolio. We’re excited about this opportunity which expands our addressable market and continues our efforts to diversify away from the most cyclical large project segment of the non-resi construction market.', 'Lastly, we’ve launched an initiative to look at opportunities for material procurement savings across all of Apogee. Historically, our purchasing has been mostly decentralized across our nine individual operating units. We’re analyzing all categories of spend for opportunities to leverage our scale and drive synergies in our supply chain.', \"We’ve engaged with a leading advisory firm to add expertise and help accelerate these efforts. We’re still in the early stages of this initiative but believe the opportunity will have meaningful impact on our profitability in fiscal '21 and beyond. We’ll have more to say about this in the future quarters.\", 'We have an exciting set of opportunities ahead of us, most of which are largely in our own control which gives us confidence in our plan to deliver continued earnings growth over the next several years.', 'With that, I’ll pass it over to Jim who will provide more details on the quarter and our outlook. And before we take questions, I’ll return with a few additional comments. Jim?', 'James Porter', \"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our consolidated results, which you can see on Page 5 of our earnings presentation. Total revenue came in at $357 million, down slightly from last year’s second quarter with strong growth in Architectural Glass offset by the expected lower revenues in Architectural Services.\", \"Operating margin of 7.7% was down from adjusted margin of 8.1% in last year's second quarter. Lower margins in Architectural Services and Framing Systems were partially offset by improved margins in Architectural Glass.\", \"EBITDA came in at $39.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $40.6 million in last year's second quarter. Net interest and other expense increased to $2.2 million on higher debt levels and the tax rate of 24% was comparable to last year’s level. Putting it altogether, earnings per share were $0.72.\", \"I’ll now turn to segment results on Slide 6. Framing Systems revenue was $187 million, down slightly from last year's $189 million. Operating income was $15.5 million with an operating margin of 8.3% compared to adjusted operating margin of 10.2% in last year's second quarter.\", 'The lower margin was due to less favorable project mix as well as cost associated with initial steps of implementing the supply chain synergy projects that Joe mentioned. These costs add about 100 basis point margin headwind in the quarter for Faming Systems.', 'Architectural Glass had a strong year-over-year improvement over an easy prior year comparison. Glass revenue grew 13% to $99 million reflecting increased volume and a more favorable sales mix.', 'Operating margin improved to 6.5% compared to 2% last year primarily driven by operating leverage on increased volume and improved productivity in our factories. Glass segment margins were negatively impacted in the quarter by about 100 basis points from start-up costs related to the new facility for the growth initiatives serving the short lead time segment. Year-to-date, we have incurred $1.6 million of our estimated $4 million to $5 million of start-up expenses for this initiative.', 'As expected, Architectural Services revenue decreased to $62 million from $76 million in last year’s second quarter due to timing of projects. Operating income was $4 million with operating margin of 6.5% down from 10% in last year’s second quarter due to reduced operating leverage on the lower revenue base.', 'Architectural Services continued to have great success in its markets with several new project wins during the quarter which increased the segment’s backlog to a record $502 million.', 'Our Large-Scale Optical segment grew its revenue by 2% to $21 million. Segment operating margin increased to 22.3% compared to 20.8% in last year’s second quarter. Both revenue and margin benefitted from a more favorable sales mix in the quarter.', 'Turning to Slide 7, I’ll briefly touch on cash flow and the balance sheet. We had a solid quarter at cash flow rebounding from a slow start to the year in the first quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have now generated $18 million of cash from operations.', 'We’re still below last year’s level, primarily due to increased working capital related to completing the legacy EFCO project which has reduced the year-to-date cash flow by $21 million. We expect this working capital impact will be much less in the second half of the fiscal year. Year-to-date, capital expenditures were $23 million and we continue to expect full year CapEx in the range of $60 million to $65 million.', 'During the quarter, we used our positive cash flow to pay down $20 million of debt reducing our total debt to $273 million, down from $293 million at the end of the first quarter. As we move through the rest of the fiscal year, we’ll look to deploy excess free cash flow to further reduce debt and we’ll also continue to evaluate opportunistic share buybacks.', 'Turning to Page 8 for the outlook, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year. We are adding some costs into the fiscal year for the supply chain productivity and purchasing synergy projects that we mentioned that were not previously factored into our outlook. We believe these are high return investments that will increase our future profitability. However, most of the positive impact will not be seen until next year.', 'That said, we’re working to offset these investments in the back half of this fiscal year as these additional costs are a factor that could push us towards the low end of our guidance range. The upper end of our guidance range assumes more favorable project schedules which drive higher revenues in the year, increased order volume in the shorter lead time segments of our business and accelerated progress on various margin improvement initiatives.', 'We’ve made a few adjustments to our segment guidance, which is on Page 9. Our full year guidance for Framing Systems is unchanged. As of our last earnings call, we did expect Q3 to be strongest quarter for Framing Systems. However, due to customer project schedules there were some Framing Systems revenue pulled forward into the second quarter and some is pushed out into the fourth quarter.', 'We also are expecting an additional roughly 100 basis points of margin headwind for Framing Systems in the third quarter from additional costs associated with the implementation of the supply chain projects with offsetting benefits more weighted to starting the fourth quarter and next fiscal year as these projects kick in.', 'So at this point we expect Framing revenue and margins to be sequentially lower in Q3 with a rebound in the fourth quarter. Just as a reminder, timing shifts of customer construction project schedules is not unusual for this segment and we remain focused on effectively servicing our customers.', 'In Architectural Glass, we now expect full year revenue growth in the upper single digits, down a bit from our previous estimate of approximately 10% growth. This is primarily due to the increased competitive pressure related to the currency exchange rates that Joe discussed. We are also slightly reducing our full year margin outlook for Architectural Glass to a range of 6% to 7% compared to our previous forecast of approximately 7%.', \"We continue to expect approximately $4 million to $5 million of total start-up costs for the new Architectural Glass growth initiative which will reduce full year Glass margins by 100 to 150 basis points. These start-up costs will have the greatest impact in the third quarter as we begin operations. We should begin to generate limited revenue in the fourth quarter and we expect this initiate will continue to ramp up in fiscal '21 making positive contributions to both revenue and operating income.\", 'Our outlook for Architectural Services has improved compared to our previous guidance based on solid year-to-date results and some new project wins that will begin to flow this fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter. We now expect full year Architectural Services revenue will decline by approximately 10%, which is compared to our previous guidance of a decline of approximately 15%. And we now see full year margins of approximately 7% at the high end of our previous range of 6% to 7%. The project wins and backlog bode well for the Services segment as we look ahead to fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.', 'Finally, our full year outlook for Large-Scale Optical is unchanged as we continue to expect mid-single digit growth in operating margins of approximately 25%. So we have some puts and takes but net-net we feel good about our full year guidance.', 'With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Joe.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Thanks, Jim. To wrap up, we were pleased with the progress we have made through the first half of the fiscal year. We’re delivering on our commitments and we see a lot of positive momentum across our businesses, and we’re taking action to sustain this momentum with a number of strategic initiatives that should contribute to revenue growth and margin expansion as we look ahead to next fiscal year.', 'These initiatives are underway and some are already having a positive impact. I continue to believe the future is bright for Apogee. We have a terrific team. Our business strategy has strengthened our company in an exciting set of opportunities ahead of us.', 'With that, I’d like to open it up for your questions. Sonia, if you could please do so. Thank you.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Moore of CJS Securities. Your line is now open.', 'Chris Moore', 'Hi. Good morning, guys.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Hi, Chris.', 'Chris Moore', 'Good morning. Maybe, Jim, just start again on the – talk about kind of the puts and takes in terms of reaching the higher and lower end of EPS guidance for this year?', 'James Porter', 'Yes. So the two primary factors are really going to be the kind of timing of the work that we have in front of us that we’re pursuing and the ability to fill in, in the short lead time parts of the business. And those are going to move the needle in revenues and leverage and flow through in the different businesses associated with it. And then the timing of the potential benefits that we see from these initiatives coming in, we’re trying to ramp up each of those initiatives as quickly as possible and trying to generate savings within this fiscal year to offset the costs associated with it, which is more of a headwind in the third quarter before the benefits start to kick in. But depending on how rapidly we’re able to see some of those benefits come into this fiscal year, that’s a driver that could push us to the higher end. The lower end assumes that we have more of the costs and we don’t have the revenue upsides.', 'Chris Moore', 'Got you, thanks. And then on the new Glass initiative, maybe Joe, can you just talk about kind of who’s the competition there? Are there any unique challenges from a labor standpoint or otherwise associated with this?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, Chris, again, I have been a little bit quiet on this for strategic reason or competitive reasons, and I’ll continue to limit my comments. We are actually launching this quarter that we’re in right now Q3, so there will be more for me to say as we go forward. But this will allow us to compete in the regional market where very short lead times are required. We have a very automated facility. The people, which is far more limited than we’re used to in our other factories is fully in place. We’re using existing leadership from the company at the top of this operation, and so we’re confident we have the leadership team and the factory workers in place, and we will be able to compete in this very quick, less than two weeks lead time from order to delivery marketplace, and it’s been something I’ve frankly been envisioning for our company since I came. This investment is timely for us. We’re obviously vulnerable to global competition on the large monster towers that are not only highly volatile from an end market and revenue stream, but also such long lead times that international players can’t compete for that which is not possible in this rapid short lead time business, which is over half the market as this segment. So, it’s a regional play for us. I’m not going to get into our competitors. We’re going to do our best to be a very good competitor ourselves in this space.', 'James Porter', 'Chris, we strategically pick taxes which is a very big and robust construction market, and there’s short lead time, smaller project market has the opportunity to differentiate based on predictability, quality, and service levels which our company has a reputation for and we think will allow us to be very competitive.', 'Chris Moore', 'Got it, I appreciate it. I’ll jump back in line. Thanks, guys.', 'James Porter', 'Thanks, Chris.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Stine of Craig-Hallum. Your line is now open.', 'Eric Stine', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Hi. Good morning, Eric.', 'Eric Stine', 'Good morning. Maybe and I understand that you may not share a whole lot of details here, but I know you picked Texas first. I mean, is this something that we should think of you kind of taking a measured approach as you look at other markets? And when we think about the type of investment that is necessary, you kind of called out the 4 million to 5 million, I mean is that roughly a good way to think about what it would mean per location if you were to expand beyond Texas?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes. Well, Eric, I’m not going to comment on our strategy going forward. Obviously, as I mentioned, it’s a regional play. I think these initial P&L start-up costs are indicative of what it requires. Capital layout is much more modest than a large glass operation and it depends on whether you’re building a new building or renting a facility that exists. They are certainly within our capital wheelhouse [ph] if we chose to do further regional expansion.', 'James Porter', 'Chris, at a full facility, I think we’ve talked about this before, I mean total capital cost is going to be roughly $20 million. And this start-up cost, we’ve called out, I think there’s a certain degree of those costs which are kind of the first time you do something like this that we would expect that we’d be able to learn from in the future.', 'Eric Stine', 'Got it, okay. And then maybe since this market’s a little bit different than where you have historically been, is there a retrofit component to this or how does this maybe play into some of your retrofit goals?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, we could use this facility to supply glass for a retrofit. We are planning to use this facility to supply glass to our existing Framing Systems businesses that will include pulling through the retrofit initiative, which continues to be a very strong initiative for us and we have passed and will pass the $50 million order input from retrofit or renovation this year. And I’m very pleased with it. And this business will contribute to that. It’s not the driving force behind it though.', 'Eric Stine', 'Okay, fair enough. Maybe last one for me, just going back on some of the operational challenges that goes back a number of quarters. I know last year – I’m sorry last quarter, you kind of said that some of the hiring challenges in dealing with the high demand in glass that that was kind of a work in progress. Another solid quarter, is this something that you would still characterize it in that way or do you think it’s kind of something that you’ve put behind you?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, we’ve pretty much put the hiring issues behind us in glass. When I referenced some operational challenges in the past several quarters, I was clearly referring to the projects we acquired and acquisition of the EFCO business, which I’ve commented on in this call, and last summer the issue we had with the glass operations that is behind us and we’re at the staffing levels we need to meet current demand in glass.', 'Eric Stine', 'Okay.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Hiring across the U.S. is still a challenge in general. Most of our businesses, we’re at levels. It’s one of the more challenges all of us manufacturers in the U.S. have is finding talent. But it’s not something we’re calling out as an operational concern for us. And the big one was glass and that is behind us.', 'Eric Stine', 'Okay. Thanks.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Thanks, Eric.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Julio Romero of Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.', 'Julio Romero', 'Hi. Good morning, everyone.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Hi, Julio.', 'James Porter', 'Good morning.', 'Julio Romero', 'So wanted to ask about the strategic growth initiative in glass. Historically, when you’ve talked about that shorter lead time in market from – you’ve talked about education, healthcare as more of that type of work and less office type of projects. Is that the same way we should think about any future work that you’d be targeting in Texas?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'It really covers all segments. What it covers is really kind of smaller office, if you think more like three or four kind of storey type office building, but it really is geared to service all segments of the marketplace people. Store front less than – think of buildings that are generally less than five stories. Again, that’s about half of the Architectural Glass market, whereas our existing glass business generally is focused on buildings above 10 stories. The customer base is similar. Many of the general contractors and glazing contractors that are glass, people sell to, it’s the same, but they’ve never been able to go to our existing facility for these kinds of lead times. Their operations are not set up for that with the kind of glass and the coatings we have traditionally delivered.', 'Julio Romero', 'Got it, that’s helpful. And then on the supply chain synergy projects in Framing, can you talk about how long of a runway you think this could potentially be a driver for you on the margin side and maybe what kind of annual margin benefit roughly we can expect going forward for that?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, Julio, really what we’re doing is when we look at this particular initiative is looking at kind of our extrusion, finishing, fabrication supply chain across three of the Framing Systems businesses. And we really in the third quarter we should be complete in terms of implementing this kind of new supply chain flow, if you will. And then should start to see benefits from it in the fourth quarter as it kind of ramps up. Fourth quarter tends to be a little bit softer seasonally, but that’s when we’ll start to see the benefits.', 'Julio Romero', 'Got it. Thanks very much and best of luck in the back half of the fiscal year.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Thanks, Julio.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital. Your line is now open.', 'Jon Braatz', 'Good morning, everyone.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Good morning, Jon.', 'Jon Braatz', 'Joe, just want to touch on the strong dollar and its impact on your business. You cut your guidance back a little bit in the Architectural Glass because of that. Are you just no longer competitive in many projects now or have you lost any business? Can you talk a little bit about the impact the stronger dollar is having on maybe the bidding and the activity levels that you’re seeing?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Sure, yes. Jon, we’re still – our Glass segment is still the market leader and share demand in the large projects greater than 20 stories, meaning commercial towers and 5 to 10 to 15 storey buildings, which we call the midmarket. Both those markets make up a little less than half the end market. They’re about equal. And our business is the largest demand – share demand player in that space. But we used to have such a large share demand in the large monumental projects that we had nowhere to grow, it was nothing but downside. And right now, at about $1.10 per euro – when I arrived here, we were even in the midst of just coming out of the Great Recession, we were exporting about $40 million of glass. The dollar and the euro was about a $1.30 to the euro at the time. I believe that could be more parity based on the economies in Europe and the U.S. at the times. We’re not counting on it going back there. As it started to go back from a $1.05 to $1.20 about two years ago, we started to see relief on this issue for us. And now that it’s kind of plummeted, it got below $1.10 a week or so ago. It’s back at $1.10 now. Yes, we’ve lost some large projects. I’m very pleased that our business has a very disciplined approach to selecting projects. We are not going to chase low margin work. Right now, our European competitors have an advantage on price with the conversion at these rates and European cost basis. And that’s why we’re making efforts like we have in this small projects move that we’ve been working on for many years. We’re still winning a lot of work in this space, but we’ve lost some share recently and we’ve seen some awards go to European competitors. They still have to deliver. We’re a great competitor. Jim highlighted our strengths in our glass businesses; our quality, delivery and how we stand behind our product. But first and foremost, we’ll remain disciplined in project selection. That is the forefront of why our Services segment has been doing so well is their disciplined approach to what projects they will go after. But we’re still the share leader in the large and mid projects as we stand here today and expect we will be going forward.', 'Jon Braatz', 'Okay, Joe, thanks. One other question. Obviously, you’re trying to recover some costs associated with the EFCO business and you talked about in the last quarter and this quarter. As it stands today, are you more confident about recovery of some of these costs that you incurred compared to maybe where you were three months ago?', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, I’m confident I wouldn’t say more or less. I’m very confident we will or I wouldn’t say it. I expect we will see some recovery in the second half of the year. Obviously, they’ll be non-recurring and we’ll call them out. But we deserve what we’re going after. We will fight hard. It’s not my operating people that are distracted. It’s kind of the corporate team. And I’m fine with that. And my operating team are focused on running the business, driving growth, executing the completion of that project we’ve referred to. But my confidence remains where it was that I feel just in saying I believe we will see recovery and we will see some this year. But these things take time and we’ll report it as soon as we have news to report.', 'Jon Braatz', 'Okay.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'They are not – but I want to be clear, Jon, they’re not in our outlook.', 'Jon Braatz', 'I understand. Okay. All right. Thank you.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Thanks, Jon.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Puishys for closing remarks.', 'Joseph Puishys', 'Yes, thank you, Sonia. Team, I feel confident we did what we said we would do. We’ve hit our numbers. We remain focused on long-term growth. And while we can’t necessarily control the end markets, we still feel they are relatively balanced and we are acting on what we can control, which is our cost and margin expansion opportunities at Apogee.', 'I look forward to another solid quarter when we talk to you in about three months. And good luck and we’ll look forward to follow up with some of you over the next few days and weeks. Have a great day, everybody.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Well, let's go ahead and get started. Good morning, everyone. I'm Rajeev Lalwani, Morgan Stanley's A&D analyst. I'm excited to have the Raytheon management team with us. Closest to me, Tom Kennedy, the Chairman and CEO; and then, Toby O'Brien, the CFO. Before we get started, I think, Toby is going to come up here and make some remarks on disclosures.\", \"Toby O'Brien\", 'Thanks, Rajeev, and just real quick. So, during the discussions today, both Tom and I may make forward-looking statements, such as comments on future plans, objectives, expected performance and the proposed merger with UTC. These are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual actions or results to differ greatly. You should consult our SEC filings for a description of those risks and uncertainties including with respect to the proposed merger and related matters, and the definitive merger proxy statement we filed on September 10, 2019.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - Rajeev Lalwani', \"Thanks, Toby. Well, let's go ahead and get started. One thing I wanted to start on with Tom is, just the U.S. defense budget, there has been a lot going on during the last couple of months. So, I guess, first, how are you feeling about the budgets? And it seems like we're looking at a bit of a trail off with growth [technical difficulty]. In terms of U.S. budget, it seems like we're trailing off a bit, so just your thoughts there, Tom?\", 'Tom Kennedy', \"Yes. Let me first start off with overview here first. And number one, thank you for having us here today, I appreciate it, at the Morgan Stanley's 7th Annual Conference, at a tremendous location. It's one of my favorite locations, Laguna Niguel. And I didn't go surfing this morning, but neither did you.\", \"So, in any case, bottom line is, the Company has been doing exceptionally well, continues to perform, outperform the market, and we don't see anything stopping that moving forward. Hopefully, many of you were able to dial in on earnings call. To me, very strong quarter -- the second quarter, we had some major, call it, new bookings that came in at year out of the country of Qatar, which was a greenfield country for us back in 2014, and we continue to build our presence in that country over the years and across the entire Middle East.\", 'The one of the big elements of that second quarter and strong second quarter was the fact that at the end, we did raise our guidance across almost all of our metrics. So, again, a very powerful quarter, very powerful year, and we see significant strong outlook in the future.', \"I'd also like to talk a little bit about the merger. We're going to have a bunch of questions on that. So, I'm not going to get into details of it, but I would like to let you know that we are still very excited about it. We're -- right now, our teams are doing integration planning across the board. I can tell you, that's going very, very smoothly, and we are still on track for the first half closure of that merger in 2020.\", \"And finally, I'm very, very pleased to make the announcement that Greg Hayes and I have selected Toby O’Brien, as the CFO for the Raytheon Technologies Company moving forward. How about -- can we give him a big round of applause?\", \"And now, I'm going to switch gears and answer your questions. Okay?\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Sure.', 'Tom Kennedy', 'Sure. So, let me talk about the defense budget. One thing I want put in perspective is, I look at this budget, I peel this budget apart, I do ratios, I try to look at all the elements and how that impacts our business moving forward. And one thing I did is, I was looking at the modernization budget because that’s really our addressable budget part of the defense budget.', \"And I went back to fiscal year '17 and then compared to what the budget looks like, the top line budget number for the modernization budget for 2020, still got to get approved, appropriators are working really hard. But that top line number is kind of fixed. And if you compare fiscal year '17 to fiscal year '20 budget, it’s a 25% increase over that period of time in that total budget number.\", \"And then, if you peel the onion one level below and go inside that modernization budget and look at what big part of the budget is for us, there’s procurement in there and there’s also something called RDT&E, Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation. And that budget in fiscal year '18, that grew 21% over fiscal year '17; and in '19, it grew another 7%. And then, the top line budget which still has to be approved, it’s at 9%.\", 'So, two things are going on here. One is that, we have a big major step function in the defense budget here over the last several years. So, we’re at all-time high. But, what you also see going on underneath that is a significant increase in the development of new systems going on, significant amount of funding being put against that. So, we’re very -- obviously, that’s very good for us.', 'So, we think that’s going to allow us to outgrow the market because way back in 2014, we started investing and putting into technologies to develop the differentiators to allow us to essentially outperform the market in capturing those competitions; and we have. Our win rates are at 70% across the Company on competitive pursuits.', 'And so, bottom line is, what we started in 2014, is paying off now. And the DoD budgets are catching up in that specific area where we made those investments, going forward. So, we’re very, very, obviously, optimistic about that. The other one I’d just go back a little bit is this whole thing of suppression on the defense budget due to something called the Budget Control Act of 2011.', 'The Budget Control Act of 2011 put caps on funding all the way out to 2021. And so, almost every year, the Congress had to come in and raise those caps. Well, this is the last time they have to raise them, because in this Budget Control Act for 2020, they essentially -- they’ve taken off the caps for 2020 and 2021, which was the last year of the Budget Control Act 2011’s cap timeframe.', 'So, we’re very optimistic also for 2021, as being a much, I would call it, I guess, easier year to go drive and ensure that the defense budget stays at the numbers it needs to stay, to allow us to continue to overdrive our growth in the industry.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', \"Tom, you've highlighted some nice numbers '17 to '21. Obviously, it’s a bit frontend loaded as far as the budgets are concerned. How much of that has actually flowed through your numbers already? Said another way, what are expectations for your growth, going forward?\", 'Tom Kennedy', 'Well, we’ve given guidance this year of over 7% growth for 2019 and we see a continued growth out beyond that. Let me just go back on a couple of things here. There’s something called a multiyear that the DoD does. And to get a multiyear is like every 20 years, it’s a big prize. This year, we are negotiating two major multiyear contracts, one on the SM-3 Block IB, the other one on another missile called SM-6. These are -- each of those are five-year multiyears. And those five-year multiyears, when you run them out essentially lays out about eight years worth of revenue generation on each one of those.', \"It's a different world out there today. The government is doing two things. One is they're re-upping on their ammunition and their missiles and reconstituting their war reserve modes. And at the same time, as I mentioned before, on this RDT&E, they're also generating funding for the next generation franchising capabilities that they need. And this is all defined in something called the NDS, National Defense Strategy.\", 'And if you go in there, it talks about these three buckets. I [indiscernible] on buckets in our earnings call. One is deterrence. The other one is the counterterrorism. And the third bucket is this whole issue of a peer threat. So, a lot of this RDT&E money is going to the generation -- next generation weapon systems to essentially fulfill this concern that we have about peer threats out there, both Russia and China, and being able to counter those threats.', \"And walking the halls of Congress, I will tell you that both parties in both the House and the Senate are behind this NDS. They've all agreed with this NDS, this National Defense Strategy, and they're all supporting the funding of that strategy. And again, that strategy will require us to ensure that we have the weapon systems that we need to fight today, but also the weapon systems that we need to counter these peer threats to certain degree today and tomorrow.\", \"So, we are not seeing any kind of wind out there that's saying, hey, defense budgets are too high, we need to start cutting them down, and we feel very optimistic moving forward.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Toby, I’d love your thoughts as well in terms of what you think that growth could look like over the next few years? Tom did a great job of sort of laying some of the broader pieces, but would love to get your thoughts as well.', \"Toby O'Brien\", \"Yes. So, we've talked about 2019 that's our -- we're on track for our fifth year of accelerated growth. We did increase the total year guidance for revenue to 6.5% to 8.5%, as Tom alluded to in his comments. And we've been pretty consistent in saying that almost under any DoD budget scenario, we would expect the Company to continue to grow for the next three to four years, and we’re sticking with that.\", \"I'll remind you -- I know, we're talking about DoD, but we're just under a third international, right? And over this period of time where we've been growing, we have been seeing growth on both the international and the domestic side. Taking where our backlog is, Tom's comments about the multiyears and the budget, we're going to see healthy growth in 2020, 6% to 8%, in that range there. We expect 2020 overall to be a strong year financially for us, and we’ll give some more details here in a little over a month on our October call.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Okay. So, it’s a pretty good number for 2020, what about margin?', \"Toby O'Brien\", \"So, margins, similar story for what we've been saying. We've been seeing the headwinds from the development programs, the mix, right? And this year, we had about 20 basis points of margin headwind and offset with about 40 basis points of productivity that went into our guidance assumption. And going forward, a combination of a change in mix, continued productivity, the effects of things like the multiyear in our international business would expect to be able to continue to incrementally expand margins in 2020 and beyond.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Great. Tom, I wanted to come back to you. There is a particular program that people keep asking you about, I think you saw this question coming in terms of LTAMDS. Where are we? How are you feeling about it? I believe, from talking to Kelsey, a decision could come as early as the end of this month. So, I’d love some perspective there.', 'Tom Kennedy', 'So, let me back up and say, what is this LTAMDS, outside of being a very interesting acronym, it’s the next-generation radar for the Patriot system, and it’s a radar that the U.S. army wants to develop to essentially allow the Patriot system to continue to live on for another 40 years. And so, it’s an important program to Raytheon, it’s important program to the United States Army, it’s important program to our country because this program allows us to counter these evolved threats that are now coming up, and a lot of them due to Russia, China, but also some new threats like counter UASs and whatnot.', 'So, this radar provides the ability to see these threats in much longer ranges, allowing our forces to interdict these -- the effects from these forces and therefore keep themselves safe and the area they’re protecting safe. Just remember, radar starts with an R, and Raytheon starts with an R. Radar capability is in the heart and the soul of the Raytheon Corporation. This is back in 1922, when the Company switched from refrigeration into electronics; one of the major areas was going into radar technology. And Raytheon Corporation was a major player in turning around World War II by helping the UK relative to their radar.', 'So, we have those long -- bottom line, a long history in radars. But not just the history, also an investment profile in radars. So, we actually developed the very elementary part of a radar, the elementary part, it’s called GaN chip, the gallium nitride technology. So, why is that important and why did we go vertical on that? Well, we went vertical on that because it allows us to do thing with GaN chip and are not done on the commercial production lines to significantly enhance that device to a point where it gives us a differentiator and discriminator in a workplace, I mean, in the marketplace.', 'And you see that in the wins that we’ve had. Way back in the AMDR radar, that was taken away, the Aegis radar, and now we are the Aegis radar moving forward for all the DDG-51s, also working back to that, winning another radar from the Navy called the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar using that technology, another radar for the Air Force called the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar, all -- one of the main discriminators was this GaN technology. We’ve actually taken that GaN technology to the next step. And on that next step, we’re taking that into this LTAMDS radar.', \"We were there. They had something called the sense-off. On airplane, they have fly-offs back, back in the summer, they had something called the sense-off. We had that technology there, we demonstrated that advanced technology. And if you saw our competitors, the competitors did not bring their advanced stuff to the game. They just took what they had. So, we feel very positive that we did a very good job on the sense-off. We think we have a very value proposal that we provided to the United States Army, both in the performance of the system, but also in terms of the affordability of the system. And we are anxiously awaiting the outcome of that competition, but we’re all in. And I think -- I don't know if I can say any more. Is that good enough?\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Yes. That was good. But, I won’t let you off that easy. What happens if you don’t win?', 'Tom Kennedy', 'Oh, if we don’t win, well…', 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'By the way, the other thing I forgot. So, R goes with Raytheon, radar and Rajeev.', 'Tom Kennedy', 'Very good.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Nice combo. But sorry, please?', 'Tom Kennedy', \"So, number one, just the layout of these programs will take five years for development, and then, starting in probably the sixth or seventh year, you’ll feel transition to some type of a production moving forward. So, relative to us -- I mean, it’s an important program strategically moving forward, but relative to revenue, relative to growth, we have many other irons in the fire that we're pursuing and we're doing very well on. I mentioned all those radars that we won here -- this all since 2014 and they are franchises.\", \"And when we talk about a franchise, we don't mean a book in turn in two years, we're talking something that's going to last for 40 years. And in our structure that we do is we don't allow those franchises to essentially sunset. We continue to insert technology. If you go back and look at this, we probably, in terms of our industry, have the most franchises of any company relative to our peers. And those franchises have a longest life because we have a formula inside the Company on how we continue to upgrade those franchises over time to make them relevant.\", \"So, the bottom line is, this is strategically important to us, but we're doing all these other franchises on the side, and we’ve won a bunch of other programs, missile programs. We just this year -- the Naval Strike Missile replaces the Harpoon. The last Harpoon run was something called the Harpoon II. It was 7,000 missiles at $1.25 million apiece. We've replaced that with a new system, NSM. We have a sister of NSM called JSM. And that system is going to go on the F-35. And it was a partnership with Kongsberg that was developed. So, we didn't have to put capital into that to go bring that franchise on board. And I can go on and on, the additional franchises we're bringing on board relative to the missile company.\", \"So, strategically, it’s something that we don't want that let happen, but I think the Company is resilient because we have all these different franchises. We don't rest on one program. I don't have one program that's 30% of my revenue. And I think, that's what makes us a great pick relative to a company to -- horse to ride because of the fact that our resilience, both in up and down markets, but also in terms of the competitions and how we win. So, it’s really based on our business model and how we operate.\", \"Toby O'Brien\", \"If I could just add one thing to maybe fill in the timeframe there. So, to Tom's point, five years development, start to get into production for the U.S., right, it implies, but it's also the reality, the likelihood of selling the LTAMDS internationally is probably close to 10 years down the road. Back up to today, we have 16 countries that have Patriot, soon to be a 17th with Bahrain that have signed their an LOA, and when they get under contract.\", \"So, even if we were unsuccessful, right. We would continue to support, the current base of Patriot radars, continue with that effort, right. We'd continue with the logistics, the engineering services. So, Patriot wouldn't go out of our portfolio, on top of the fact that in the near-term, financially, it's not a big contributor from the LTAMDS perspective, when you win it, right? So, I think it’s good to understand that total picture.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', \"Yes, for sure. And maybe a quick one and I wanted to go into a different topic. First, any other programs that we should be looking out for, where there's a notable re-compete?\", 'Tom Kennedy', \"Well, I mean, it’s re-compete on our competitors’ side. Can I mention all of this? We don’t really have any -- many on our side -- in our incumbency where we’re competing big ones. But, there is a new missile that we’re competing on called the Precision Strike Missile, and that replaces a missile called the ATACMS. And so, we are, -- we and the Lockheed are participating in that program and competing on it. We will be doing flight test later this year. And we are very, I'd say, positive on the program in what we've been able to put together as a solution that meets and exceeds the customers’ but also at a very affordable price. That's a big one there.\", 'Actually, there was an article out today relative to the Senate, Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Shelby; increasing about over $1 billion of funding in hypersonics and also some other areas like the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program. It’s a satellite program, but we play a major role in there on the sensor that goes on to satellite, the primary sensor. And so, that’s a big -- that’s a competition that’s going on in that area.', 'And then, a little bit further out is the long-range strike weapon, LRSO. That’s to replace the Air-Launched Cruise Missile that was not ours before. So, we’re in a lot of competitions where we’re going after things that we were not the incumbent on. And that’s one of the reasons, why we’re so positive that we believe we can outperform the market because we are taking market share away from our competitors. And not only is the budget going up, but if you go look at our history here, especially since 2014, we have actually taken away work share.', \"So, the combination of those two is, I think, provides us a solid foundation moving forward because what we’re doing is now -- and Toby mentioned it, because we have a big campaign, and Toby and I are big margin players in op margin. And so, what we’re trying to do is accelerate to drive these development programs into production. So, some of the programs that we won in '14 and '15 are now starting to get to that four or five-year point where they’ve transitioned into low-rate initial production and moving forward.\", 'And we got to keep that cycle going, which is a few new ones coming in. And we want to increase our base on production programs because they have higher margin. And that’s why I mentioned earlier, these two multiyears that we’re in final negotiations on, and getting those across the goal line because they are big production programs, which then again allow us to achieve this margin expansion moving forward.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', \"We've touched on hypersonic, obviously, the buzz word in the industry. But that being said, can you talk about how you’re performing versus your peers? I think the narrative out there is that you’re sort of not winning your fair share. Is that fair or unfair?\", 'Tom Kennedy', 'I think, it’s unfair, and it’s -- let me first step back because you can’t look at hypersonics without looking at counter-hypersonics. So, there’s a whole new market. And this new market is a fact that things are going to be flying as Mach 5 or faster. And you have -- it can be either the things that you have, or the things that the threat can have. But in any case, that marketplace is providing those type of systems that can fly faster than Mach 5. And then under that market is -- then you got to counter those things that fly faster than Mach 5. It turns out the harder problem is countering those things that fly higher than Mach 5.', 'And it’s actually a bigger market because not only that you have to have the effect that counters the weapon, but you also have to have the sensing capability and the command and control that can very quickly detect that target, that hypersonic target, track that hypersonic target and then hand it off in the right way to an effect that can be applied against it to take it out. So, we’re in both of those markets. So, let me start on the market on the hypersonics.', 'So, we’re involved in the two key programs at DARPA and we’re prime on those programs. One is called the HAWC program, which is a Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept; the other one is the Tactical Boost Glide. And so, that’s kind of the breakout of those two areas.', 'We’re also involved in the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike under a subcontract from Lockheed, and then, a recent contract came out from the U.S. Army to a company called Dynetics to do a glide body work, and we’re working on that element of that program.', \"And there are several classified programs, I can't get into too much detail here but they are all in the hypersonic area. We've actually had to build a whole building in Tucson, Arizona just because of the hypersonic work. So, we are actively involved in hypersonics. It's a new area for us. It's an expansion area. And so, we're all in on that. On the other side of it, and I mentioned R stands for radar and also Raytheon, we are developing next-generation sensors to be able to track these hypersonic weapons.\", \"And so, we’re getting significant amount of funding for that technology. Because of these hypersonics and the speed of these hypersonic weapons, the U.S. government has an issue relative to being able to detect -- they can detect them, but being able to track them. So, there's work that's going on to develop potentially a low earth orbit constellation of satellites. We're heavily engaged in the sensor technology for that.\", \"And then, in terms of the effects, we have the effects to go counter these hypersonic missiles, including missile on missile. We do the hit-to-kill stuff. We know how to do that. So, we’re actively involved in that, and we're also involved in other effects like High Energy Leasers, HEL and then also high-power micro waves. And if you want to know, if we plan high-power micro waves, just remember, high-power micro waves is essentially a radar with a lot of power you put out over a very short timeframe. So, we are very heavily involved in that.\", \"So, this whole area, when you combine hypersonics and the counter hypersonics, is a new market for us. And obviously for the DoD, it's emerging, it is not mature yet. The department really hasn't decided where they're going to go. So, they're placing bets in many areas. We're making sure that the tables of those bets are being placed on are Raytheon tables. And I think, we're doing better than the overall market and gaining access to those funds.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', \"Great. Tom, I wanted to give you a little bit of a break and turn to Toby. In particular, I wanted to talk about some of the numbers for RTX. We’ve seen some of the S-4 data and 8-K that was filed in last week or so. Can you help may be just reconcile what the cash flow generation potential is for that company you'll be CFO for? I mean the numbers that I hear and see, while north of $9 billion on a recurring free cash flow basis. But, you guys came out with $8 billion. So, help me think about what RTX actually does look like over the next several years?\", \"Toby O'Brien\", \"Yes. So, I think, you're referring specifically to the year 2021 and this $8 billion versus roughly $9 billion. And there was a filing we did last week with the reconciliation to try to help and bridge that. But here's how I think of it, right? So, the $8 billion is what we came out with back in the June Investor Presentation, when we announced the deal. That's our external commitment that we put out there.\", \"The $9 billion and that $1 billion difference, think of the $9 billion as an internal plan. Okay? And it provides for $1 billion of cushion or contingency in the event that there were some calls on cash come 2021 for RTX. Think of if there is a decision made to invest in a new aerospace program, right, that isn't ongoing today, like in NMA, as an example. There could be some straggling or lagging costs from the UTC separations, right? We don't believe there will be, but there could be some tax payments that drift into 2021.\", \"And there could be some restructuring or capital investment, right, obviously with the caveat that they would have the right return on them that aren't contemplated today in either one of the companies’ plans, right? Now, absent those right, and all else equal, I’d expect the number to be closer to $9 billion. But, again, the $8 million is what we put out there as our formal external commitment for 2021.\", 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Sure. That’s helpful. And then, in terms of synergies -- or the folks over at UTX when they did the Rockwell Collins deal, did a great job of just marching those numbers up over time and highlighting a great deal of confidence. Is that any different when it comes to RTX?', \"Toby O'Brien\", 'No, I think what -- so, I think, UTC has done a great job, to your point, in generating and improving and beating on those synergy targets. Here, I think, the one difference is, we’ve talked about this as largely a corporate level headquarter integration, not that there won’t be some things in the business units where we’ll see benefits. What we said, little over $1 billion of gross run rate savings post year -- post close by year four.', 'We’re sticking to that, based upon the work that we’ve done, leading up to the merger and then subsequently in the integration planning that Tom referred to in his upfront comments. We continue to see the ability to save through the supply chain in areas of procurement, some facilities, IT, the headquarters and other G&A type of costs. So, things are on track there. And obviously, we’ll be looking to do better. But, I have high degree of confidence in the ability to achieve that and maybe even exceed a little bit.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Great. And we’re starting to get tight on time, but I still have a few more questions, we’ll try to get them quickly. On the pension side, something that I’ve been thinking about more for the defense players as we’ve seen rates come down quite a bit. What does it look like for the Raytheon side, at least?', \"Toby O'Brien\", 'Yes. So, yes, we’re seeing the pressure on the rates right on the downside from discount rate. On the positive side, the return’s been real strong, well above our expected return. We’ll go through our normal process, wait closer to year end where we’ll have even better information, right, and likely what’s variability on the rates, on the return, on our cash situation. We’ll evaluate whether a discretionary contribution makes sense. I will point out, we can do that per the merger agreement, up to $0.5 billion. So, that kind of sizes what the art of the possible may be for this year.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'And that’s on top of what’s been committed to already of $0.5 billion?', \"Toby O'Brien\", 'What’s required and committed already, yes.', 'Rajeev Lalwani', 'Got it. Okay. In the last minute or so, missiles margins, I wanted to make sure I hit on that. 1Q, weak; Q2 got better. How are we feeling over the next couple of quarters?', \"Toby O'Brien\", 'Yes. So, I want to be balanced in talking about missiles, right? So, clearly, we were pleased with their performance in Q2, exceeded my personal expectations in the companies. That said, there’s more work to do, right? They have some challenges coming out of last year, not to mention Q1.

We were very pleased with the strong top and bottom-line results we achieved in the second quarter. We are particularly excited to see the multiple initiatives that we have undertaken come together resulting in strong results across the business. ', 'Summarizing our second quarter results, net sales grew 13%, gross margin expanded 480 basis points to 48.7% and our operating performance improved $4.4 million to $2 million profit, as compared to an operating loss of 2.4 million in the same period last year.', 'We delivered strong performance across all channels with double-digit sales growth in our retail and wholesale channels. We continue to gain momentum season after season, as customers respond favorably to our seasonally relevant, beautifully designed and crafted collections. We believe that the combination of our elevated product assortment marketing campaigns that communicate our brand DNA and enhance shopping experience is driving transactions in our direct-to-consumer business, as well as enabling us to expand our presence on our wholesale doors, where we have become a market share leader in the space.', 'In our direct-to-consumer segment, revenues increased 11%, attributable to a 7% comp increase and the two new store opening since the end of the second quarter last year. We saw positive comps across our full price and outlet stores, as well as exceptional strength in our e-commerce channel. Our momentum in our business strengthened throughout the quarter and has continued into the third quarter. ', 'We expect strong trends to continue through the second half as we expand our offerings in key categories within apparel, where we were under penetrated last year, and maintain a consistent offering of seasonally relevant beautifully designed product. We will also continue to test new product categories as we look to fulfill the lifestyle needs of our customers. Our wholesale channel revenue grew 15% in the second quarter. We are excited to see the broad-based strength across our department store partners, specialty retailers and third-party e-commerce sites here in the U.S. and around the world. ', \"Our brand performed extremely well at Nordstrom's anniversary sale. We are also now fully functioning on Dropship with our major department store partners, which helps drive sales during Nordstrom annual sale. We believe this functionality will continue to fuel incremental sales at favorable margin rates over the long-term. Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our strategic initiatives, which includes driving growth through a direct-to-consumer business as we continue to expand our store base in the U.S. and strategically enter international markets, increase market share within the wholesale channel, test new product categories and define our customer journey while refining our marketing efforts to drive traffic and conversion in our stores and on our website.\", 'We continue to expand our retail presence, as well as drive strong growth in our e-commerce channel, both of which have significant growth potential. Our Santana Row store in San Jose, California, which opened in early August is another great location, is off to an exceptional start. We also recently opened our Aventura Mall store in Miami and are excited to be opening our Midtown Manhattan store later this month, as we believe this is another opportunity to further capture walkaway business from exited doors, as well as to increase brand recognition in this highly trafficked area.', 'Our Prince Street expanded location reopened in early August and we are excited to be offering an elevated shopping experience in a beautifully designed store with an expanded merchandise offering.', 'Our real estate strategy, which we began two years ago, has been centered largely around short-term leases, and we were excited to build on this success. The payback period for these short-term leases is exceeding our two-year target and generating strong cash-on-cash returns. ', \"To that end, we've already extended four of these leases based on their performance and plan to open one additional new store before year's end. We will continue to opportunistically open stores across the U.S. while maintaining the flexibility in our leases to ensure we drive improved profitability across our store base.\", 'Turning to our international opportunities. Later this month, we will be opening our first company operated store outside the United States in the South Kensington area of London.', 'We believe this is an ideal market for Vince, given our strong performance with shops opened with Harvey Nichols and Selfridges over the last 18 months. ', 'This is an important step in driving awareness for the Vince brand, as consumers experience our easy luxury style firsthand. We kick started our influencer program in London, focusing on male and female influencers local to this market to further fuel brand equity.', \"We've recently been exploring entrance into the China market, where we have also seen many of our luxury peers successfully build real estate networks and developed a strong e-commerce presence. There's a healthy appetite for fashion luxury in this region, where we believe the Vince brand will have strong appeal. \", \"I've recently visited China to evaluate the market opportunity and I'm excited about the growth potential. We're in the later stages of choosing a new experience partner to help us launch in this market in fiscal 2020.\", \"Turning to our marketing initiatives, we remain focused on compelling seasonal campaigns to drive customer engagement. For fall, we launched our first campaign highlighting a group of California creatives, including artists, photographers, actors and filmmakers with deep connections to the California region. This campaign features a series of short films providing an opportunity to share unique storytelling and communicate Vince's California DNA.\", 'The campaign is also featured on social media and print, including New York Times, T Magazine, Gentlewoman, and Fantastic Man, digital advertising and Vince.com.', 'We continue to invest in proven media partners including the New York Times, Goop and Conde Nast, expanding on creative impactful custom content, experiential moments such as exclusive events. For example, we partnered with Goop on a pre fall editorial that showcases Vince as the summers go to for luxurious relaxed looks.', 'The partnership was celebrated at Goop, Sag Harbor New York location, boasting an influential guest list with our Creative Director, Caroline Belhumeur, joining host Gwyneth Paltrow.', \"We're also pleased to have reintroduced the direct mail catalog. This is designed to drive full price sales to a targeted customer group, who is motivated by new products. We have begun to drive more efficient digital marketing spend through more sophisticated audience segmentation, resulting in increased click through rates and decreases in cost per session.\", 'We saw positive results by behaviorally driven e-mail segmentation as we are delivering more meaningful and relevant messaging to the various customer segments resulting in higher AOVs and conversion.', 'We started the process of building out more robust CRM and CEM capabilities and are currently defining the future customer journey. We will focus on acquisition and retention goals towards becoming a customer focused direct-to-consumer omnichannel organization. This will tie into our efforts to build behaviorally triggered emails and direct mail communication.', \"Vince Unfold, our subscription model launched in Q4 of last year continues to gain momentum. We are seeing steady growth and new signups to receive unlimited access to a broad selection of our women's apparel. As we were early adapters of this model, we are pleased to see a growing number of brands launching an online subscription service. This furthers our confidence that subscription services align with the way customers shop and offer an additional growth avenue for our brand.\", 'Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, we may explore potential acquisitions that we believe are complimentary to the Vince brand, where we see opportunity to drive growth as well as gain strategic and operational synergies. As we continue to monitor for updates on current and pending tariffs related to List 4, we have been implementing mitigation efforts, including accelerating shipments which we started in the second quarter and continue negotiations with our vendors, who have been good partners in working with us on pricing. ', 'We also do plan to strategically increase prices on select items, where we believe we have some elasticity. Longer term, we will also be looking at other sourcing opportunities. However, quality remains paramount, therefore we will remain disciplined in the process. ', 'In summary, we are extremely excited to see the strategic initiatives that we have employed coming together to drive strong top and bottom-line performance. We expect the recent momentum to continue into the second half and beyond outside of the tariff pressures. ', 'Moreover, we are working diligently to offset the tariff increases announced to-date and therefore do not expect these cost pressures to have a meaningful impact in our financial results in fiscal year 2020. Having stabilized the business and created a strong foundation, we believe we have meaningful opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth by expanding our brand presence in the U.S. and international markets, continuing to gain market share in the wholesale channel and extending our brand awareness through a direct-to-consumer channel and marketing strategies.', \"With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\", 'Dave Stefko ', 'Thank you, Brendan. Second quarter consolidated net sales increased 13% to 71.4 million, compared to 63.1 million in the same prior year period. Our wholesale channel sales increased 14.7% to 43.4 million, primarily due to the acceleration of seasonal wholesale shipments. Our direct-to-consumer segment sales increased 10.6% to 28 million in the second quarter, while comparable sales including e-commerce increased 7.1% due to an increase in transactions and in average dollar sale.', 'Gross profit in the second quarter was 34.7 million, or 48.7% of net sales. This compares to 27.7 million or 43.9% of net sales in the second quarter last year. The 480 basis point increase in gross margin rate was primarily due to product mix efficiencies in the product development cycle, and sourcing initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter were 32.8 million or 45.9% of net sales, as compared to 30.1 million, or 47.7% of net sales for the second quarter of last year.', 'The increase in SG&A dollars was primarily a result of increased compensation and benefits partially related to the growth in stores, increased marketing investments, costs associated with enhancements to our e-commerce and Vince Unfold platforms, as well as higher occupancy costs related to new stores.', 'Operating income was $2 million or 2.8% of net sales, compared to an operating loss of $2.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Net income for the second quarter was $1 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million or $0.33 per share in the second quarter last year.', 'Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $52.1 million of borrowings under our debt agreements. This is a decrease in our overall borrowings under our debt agreements of $12.3 million since the same period last year, and was primarily the result of a $9.4 million decrease in net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, and a $2.9 million of net repayments to the term long facilities. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1 million primarily attributable to new stores. At the end of the quarter, we operated 60 stores in the US, reflecting a net increase of two stores over the prior year period. ', \"Before turning to our outlook for fiscal '19, as Brendan discussed, we have mitigation efforts underway that will partially offset the impact of tariff increases this year. We will continue to advance these efforts in fiscal 2020 through a number of initiatives without compromising our commitment to quality. As it relates to our guidance, our outlook for operating income includes an estimated $0.5 million of impact from the Section 301 tariffs that were effective May 10, 2019 and prior. This estimated $0.5 million of impact was incorporated in our guidance provided last quarter.\", \"In the updated guidance we're providing today, the operating income excludes the $2 million estimated impact, net of target mitigation efforts of additional Section 301 tariffs effective on or after September 1st of this year. For our updated fiscal 2019 guidance, we're raising our consolidated net sales expectation by $5 million to a range of $295 million to $305 million. This now reflects high single-digit consolidated net sales growth at the midpoint of our range.\", 'Noting the above, operating income is now expected to be between $7.5 million and $9.5 million reflecting an over 45% growth compared to adjusted operating income last year, at the midpoint of the range. We expect operating margin expansion partially offset by SG&A deleverage, in part due to strategic consulting fees that were recorded in the first quarter, as well as continued investments in the business. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $4 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of between $4 million to $4.5 million. ', 'In conclusion, we are pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter, which met our expectations across all key metrics. We expect to build off this momentum in the back half of the year and are confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance. ', \"Looking ahead, we've established a strong foundation and are executing the growth strategies, which Brendan discussed that we believe position us to deliver strong long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders.\", \"This concludes my comments regarding our second quarter financial performance. We'll now take your questions. Operator? \", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. ', 'Dana Telsey ', \"Good afternoon everyone, and nice to see the progress on the top line. Two questions. One on the tariffs. So, can you just go through that again, are you including the tariffs in the guidance or they're excluded in the guidance? And how do you think of the buckets in mitigation and what do you expect can be done for next year?\", \"And then second thing, on your growth rate in DTC and wholesale, what were the product mix that drove the business and how do you -- and was there a stronger beginning or end to the quarter? And anything else we should be watching as we go into 3Q and 4Q, whether it's with collaborations with some of the new marketing that you mentioned, Brendan, you think will be impactful to continue to accelerate the sales? Thank you.\", 'Brendan Hoffman', \"Thanks, Dana. I'll try and go through all that. But pause me, if I miss something. So regarding the guidance, as stated in the press release and the remarks, there's $2 million from the September 1st list for tariffs that are not included in our guidance, September 1st and later. So what we gave you was the trajectory of the business, excluding those tariffs. The impact of those tariffs after mitigation is about $2 million. So that's why we pulled that out. There is $500,000 that's included in the guidance from the earlier tariffs in May.\", \"So that reflects what was initiated over the last four weeks, that we just weren't able to fully mitigate, because of the timing. We did not feel comfortable raising prices, just operationally wasn’t very difficult to do. We are going to raise prices selectively on some of our core items that are go forward items and that will happen over the course of the next couple of months. We have worked very closely with our suppliers to mitigate some of the increase as well as accelerating some shipments to get them here before the tariffs were implemented.\", \"Going forward as we look at 2020, we're frankly less concerned about that as we have time to properly price the merchandise. And we just right now -- we're in fashion week, it's spring Fashion Week. So these are goods we'll be shipping in January, February and March. And we were able to factor in what we know now, which is the 15% tariffs and price accordingly and saw no push back from our accounts, I think, speaks to the elevated product and the strength of the business that the pricing seemed very natural. So that's why we feel like, we go into next year with the proper amount of time to repair the tariffs even at this level will be, not be meaningful. \", 'Dave Stefko', 'And we do have to mention that our vendors, as Brendan mentioned in his comments, have worked with us to absorb some of the tariff cost and also to help us with strategies to support managing it. ', 'Brendan Hoffman', \"And as you know, as we all know, this seems to -- it seems to change every morning I wake up and there's a new sentiment towards what these tariffs will be or won't be. So that's why we felt it was better to categorize it the way we did. \", 'Dana Telsey ', 'Got it. ', 'Brendan Hoffman', 'And in terms of -- anything else on tariffs or guidance, Dana?', 'Dana Telsey', 'Just on, the only other thing on that is, as you think about 2020, the $2 million, do you think of it as $4 million, or you can mitigate some of $4 million for the year, or you mitigate some of it? And may even get down to $1.5 million or $2 million for on an annual basis? ', 'Brendan Hoffman', \"Yes, I don't see, as Dave mentioned, I don't see 2020 as being much of a risk. I think, given the time we have with the, and this is fresh off this week of market for Q1 merchandise and pricing in the 15% tariffs and just how natural it seemed in terms of the retails will be at, there was no pushback from the major accounts at all. So I think, given the place in the market we're at, we're going to be able to pass on enough of the price increases combined with the negotiations of partnerships or vendors and other mitigating factors that I don't anticipate it being a headwind for us in 2020.\", 'Dana Telsey', 'Got it. ', 'Brendan Hoffman', \"In terms of what was working for us, I think you asked in Q2, we continue to see the brand just hit the center of the bullseye with our customer, I mean growth -- growth was driven a lot around dresses. We saw, we added dresses to different fabrication, so they were in woven and knits this year, we added a lot more prints to the line, lot of comments on the femininity that's evolved the Vince product in and it keeps going. I keep going back to how the team has changed to a more seasonably appropriate weights and colors. So, in June and July, we're still merchandising product that is wearable at that moment in time, not something you have to put in your closet for when the weather changes. And so we continue to get high marks both from the comments and from the results we're seeing. And so that was very exciting to see in Q2.\", 'Dana Telsey', \"Got it. And then just one last thing, I literally am looking at the 10-Q as it just came out. And it looks like the operating margin on wholesale was terrific. And it looks like the revenue growth on DTC, there wasn't as much [indiscernible] that operating margin didn't come through as strong. Was anything on the puts and takes of the operating margins of DTC and wholesale?\", 'Brendan Hoffman', \"So, regarding wholesale, it just speaks to the growth we're seeing at the channel with less dilutions. I mean, our natural margin rate continues to improve. And so that means, as we have season ending true ups with our wholesale accounts, we're just able to reduce the amount of support we give them. So that's really exciting to see. \", 'In terms of DTC…', 'Dave Stefko', \"DTC, is you're asking about? On the operating income line, Dana, are you asking?\", 'Dana Telsey', 'Yes, exactly.', 'Brendan Hoffman', 'I mean on the gross margin, while Dave is looking out, on the gross margin side at DTC, we continue to see healthy full price sell throughs. And, prior to the tariffs that are better going in markup….', 'Dave Stefko', \"I mean, you're talking about the flow through on operating income Dana, is that what you're asking?\", 'Dana Telsey', \"I think it says the operating income for the quarter was around $54 million, I think it was $454,000 compared to $414,000 last year. Anything to note because the revenue grew, so just wondering what was in between that didn't drop to the operating income line?\", 'Dave Stefko', \"We also look at that for the quarter. And we've got [indiscernible] impact of new stores. Hang on a second, we're looking at it. And we have the rent cost of stores. And then we also have adjustments that were made last year to inventory reserves that benefited last year. \", 'Dana Telsey', 'Got it.', 'Dave Stefko', 'Kind of a non-repeating item.', 'Dana Telsey', 'Got it. Thank you.', 'Brendan Hoffman', \"Dana, I think, when you asked about going forward. I mean, we're starting, I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing the momentum -- well you asked how the business went in Q2, we got better as the quarter went along as I mentioned in my remarks and we've seen that continue and improve into Q3 into mid-September here. And I think we had a great anniversary sale at Nordstrom, as I mentioned, and I think what we're seeing in our own DTC business that's providing a lift is -- some misses, we had last year in the collection in terms of price points. We have some higher AU, higher priced items this year with some of the shearling and leathers, and particularly in our own DT stores, as own stores and online that really can move the needle. And so having a great reaction to those that is driving early business and it was something we identified when we post mortem last fall that we felt that, that would enhance the collection. And so far, it looks like we were right.\", 'Operator', \"Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A period. I'll turn it back over to Brendan Hoffman for any closing remarks.\", 'Brendan Hoffman', \"Great. Well, thank you for joining the call today. As you can see, we're really excited about our long-term growth potential and we continue to build momentum in our strategic initiatives.

This represents an increase of approximately $11,518,000 or approximately 39.4%.', 'With that, I will turn the call back over to our moderator to facilitate any Q&A from our callers.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Sterling of Seaport Global. Please state your question.', 'Kevin Sterling', 'Good afternoon, Bohn and Todd. ', 'Bohn Crain', 'Hey, good afternoon.', 'Kevin Sterling', 'Yes. So, Bohn, let me -- kind of big picture here, when I look at this quarter and everything and -- your model being an asset like model seems to be acting like it’s supposed to be. And, obviously, what I mean by that is, revenue is a little light, you can still drive profitable growth either through net revenue or EBITDA, by flushing down the cost. And that seems to be what’s happening. If I can dig into kind of some of the key drivers here and maybe what’s different now than say a few years ago when this may not have happened, is it your scale, is it the new back office system, is it new business wins, that is maybe profitable than in years past? Can you kind of help us understand your model today, even in a softer freight environment, is really I think performing pretty well, whereas years past, this may not have been the case?', 'Bohn Crain', 'Yes, sure. I mean, you are kind of I think hitting a few of the salient points. There are number of contributing factors. And I guess, I’ll start with, as we talked about last quarter, we made a conscious decision to exit certain low-margin pieces of business that we’ve been able to replace with higher margin pieces of business. So, that’s part of the thematic.', 'There was certainly some softness in international freight volumes attributed to some of the trade war narrative activities that happen to land more in the agent-based stores rather than the Company-owned stores, which is why part of the reason why you see the kind of the reduction in operating partner commissions going down kind of absorbing that or kind of ultimately highlighting how less sensitive our ultimate results are as a function of some of the agent-based business activities, given such a big piece of it is paid out to the agent stations in the form of commission. And then, it ultimately goes to the health of the Company stores and their ultimate financial performance and contribution as we move forward in time, as we continue to make good on our brand promise and provide exit strategies to our operating partners in a bigger, relative position of our operations effectively flow through our Company-owned stores. And I think as of the last fiscal year, we were -- about 40% of our gross margins actually flowed through our Company-owned stores as opposed to agencies.', 'I think, all of those things help in terms of the ultimate metrics as well as the investments we’ve been making in technology and back office infrastructure that drive efficiencies that are helping us effectively, as we kind of continue to beat the drum, grow our gross margin dollars without growing our back office costs and continuing to provide scale in that way and working hard to get more of the gross margin dollars to the bottom line.', 'And so, even in the face of what was a softer quarter, we still delivered, I believe that was the best quarter, not only kind of on a comparative quarter basis, but I think that EBITDA margin was probably the highest margin in the history of the Company for a quarter ever, on that $11 million of EBITDA.', 'Kevin Sterling', 'Yes. And I think, so, you are breaking records again.', 'Bohn Crain', 'Indeed. Still, still.', 'Kevin Sterling', \"Yes, still. Yes. Don't stop. So, let me dig into that a little bit more, if you don't mind. And so, to think about the organic growth opportunities, you highlighted new business wins that are obviously higher margin business. Are some of these new business wins and some this incremental contribution to net revenue and EBITDA and organic growth, is it coming in maybe a little bit better than what you may have thought just a couple of quarters ago?\", 'Bohn Crain', \"I don't know that I would characterize it as better or worse. I would say that our industry vertical approach continues to deliver positive results for the organization. And we certainly think we’ll continue to put numbers up through those initiatives, and we continue to look for additional industry verticals to kind of broaden that. So, I guess, said more succinctly, the vertical approach is working, continues to work, and we're looking for opportunities to invest in incremental vertical industry sales resources that can broaden and strengthen that vertical approach, because we’ve had such success in that strategy.\", 'Kevin Sterling', 'Okay. So, as we -- as you look at your like sales pipeline, does it look pretty healthy with additional potential business wins, organic growth opportunities, how should we think about your sales pipeline?', 'Bohn Crain', \"You’re walking me too far out on a limb want here in terms of talking about sales pipelines. But, I still feel comfortable with the idea -- and then, I guess to kind of come back to the way we try to frame our thinking and engage with our investors on kind of this topic is, we're focused on growing our gross margin dollars. We think, call it a 4% to 6% growth in gross margin dollars is a reasonable target. And we expect to grow our EBITDA twice that, which gets back to the leverage. So, without getting into the health of ourselves pipeline and playing that hot and cold game, we still are working hard to deliver those -- that kind of baseline, pre-acquisition growth in the base in terms of those metrics around gross margin dollars and EBITDA growth.\", 'Kevin Sterling', \"Okay. No, that's fair. That helps. And, Bohn, I know -- I think, you said generated operating cash flow in the quarter of $6.3 million. What was free cash flow generation?\", 'Bohn Crain', 'Todd, do you have our technology investment for the quarter?', 'Todd Macomber', 'Technology investment, hold on. For the quarter, technology is $4.7 million versus $6.4 million. So, it’s about $1.7 million.', 'Bohn Crain', 'So, take $2 million off of that cash from operations for IT investment. So, you’re plus or minus $4 million in free cash flow.', 'Kevin Sterling', \"Very good. Okay. Thank you. And then, lastly, and I'll jump off and maybe hop back in queue. But, you highlighted Canada, it seems like Canada is doing better. Do you expect that trend to continue? What are you seeing in Canada?\", 'Bohn Crain', \"Yes. I think, that's a great kind of conversation point in that. To put it back in context -- and this is a little bit easier for me in Canadian dollars. Back when we acquire Wheels in 2015, I think, kind of the Wheels organization, including Clipper, was doing, call it, plus or minus C$10 million of Canadian dollar EBITDA at that time. And Wheels Canada now Radiant -- rebranded as Radiant Canada. And even excluding the benefit of Clipper, kind of the Radiant Canada organization is dramatically outperforming where it was at the time we acquired it. So, certainly, in the early days of that acquisition, the road was a little bumpier. But, we can -- we're quite pleased and we kind of pause for the cause and kind of acknowledge kind of looking back on our decision to do the Wheels transaction, which at the time was the largest transaction for us, and kind of look back now and say, are you glad you did that transaction or not, are you not glad you did that transaction? We're definitely happy to have done the Wheels acquisition. And I think, we're just at the beginning of a lot of good things in Canada.\", 'Harry Smit and the team up there are doing a fantastic job. We talk a lot about how bundling strategy and effectively combining what most folks would call, contract logistics type services with our core transportation service offering has really -- is giving us a differentiated value proposition in the marketplace. And they continue to do some impressive things up there.', 'Operator', 'Any further questions Mr. Sterling?', 'Kevin Sterling', 'That’s all I got. Thank you. Thank you for your time this evening.', 'Bohn Crain', 'Thanks, Kevin.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Please state your question.', 'Jason Seidl', 'Thank you, operator. Hey Bohn, hey Todd. I wanted to talk a little bit sort of about the outlook for your use of free cash along with potentially taking on some more debt. Your [technical difficulty]', 'Operator', 'Hey, Mr. Seidl, I believe we lost you. [Operator Instructions]', 'Bohn Crain', 'I think, I can fill in the blank for his questions, but I’ll let him restate it. So, go ahead, Jason, sorry.', 'Jason Seidl', 'Hey. Can you guys hear me now?', 'Bohn Crain', 'Yes, we can. Yes.', 'Jason Seidl', 'Yes. No, what I was saying is, when you look at your free cash flow generation and your ability to take on debt, how do you balance how you look at acquisitions in terms of where your stock’s trading versus any large acquisition? Forget about the tuck-in ones that seem to always work out when they come up. And then, versus buying back your own stock, which can be a double-edged sword in this marketplace with your liquidity.', 'Bohn Crain', \"Yes. So, I guess, I'll kind of take that from the top, which is we’ve traditionally said, we continue -- as you’ve kind of alluded to, we’re continuously in the marketplace looking at what would be the smaller tuck-in acquisitions. And certainly, the majority of the transactions we would do, look like that. From time to time, we look at larger transactions. They would have to be compelling for us to effectively pay up, to do a larger transaction. We have done it at least once before with success with the Wheels transaction. So, it’s something that we would consider. It would have to be compelling strategically for us to look at doing something like that. But, it’s definitely something we would consider.\", \"Now, I’ll try to bring that answer back into the context of your broader question, which to say more bluntly, how do we think about M&A activities when our own stock is trading at plus or minus six times or whatever it’s trading at currently on a EBITDA to enterprise value basis. And so, I think, part of the answer to that question is kind of grounded in the idea that we believe the intrinsic value of the business that we have and we continue to build is we would link to think is at least a 10 to 12 times multiple. So, we think about transactions and creating value in the context of -- that is the ultimate intrinsic value of what we're doing.\", \"If we tried to manage our long-term allocation of capital around the short-term volatility of our stock, I'm not quite sure how that would play out in terms of ever being able to get anything accomplished. And so, a couple of other data points around this conversation. We're also quite willing to buy back our own stock. If we don't find the right type of M&A opportunities, and we're accumulating cash, people should fully expect us to be in the market buying in our stock, particularly at these types of valuation multiples that we see today. And then, ultimately, part of this conversation would ultimately include a conversation around how we think about leverage. And kind of in that regard, I think, we would be comfortable leveraging up to a normalized funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio of call it plus or minus 3 times as we would think about kind of a normalized balance sheet.\", \"And then, just kind of as a reminder for some of the folks on this call, we effectively delevered our balance sheet in the summer of 2015 when we did our public secondary. And we have -- we really never relevered the business since 2015. We’ve been paying off debt and have worked hard to put ourselves in this position where we've got more financial flexibility than we've ever had in the history of the Company.\", \"So, we've got a lot of options in front of us, which we worked hard to create. We're committed to continuing to be good allocators of capital, which I think is ultimately at the heart of your question. And we're taking a comprehensive look in terms of tuck-in acquisitions, larger transactions, stock buybacks, and all in the context of our opportunity and the vagaries of the marketplace with our tweeting President.\", \"So, I’m not sure if I did complete justice to your question, but that's the brain-dump.\", 'Jason Seidl', \"Well, Bohn, I guess, what you're saying is, for now, obviously, with the tuck-ins as they come, you could take them because you usually get some plus or minus 5 times with and around protecting yourself. But that you do see a willingness to potentially buy something out there in the marketplace, if it's the right fit, like say, Wheels because while it may be a little bit dilutive in the near-term, in the longer-term, that will help you realize giving that higher multiples in the marketplace as you properly integrate such an acquisition. Is that said correctly?\", 'Bohn Crain', \"Yes. I think, the short answer is, yes. The one caveat would be -- is I think, even if we looked at a larger type transaction on adjusted EPS basis, it would still be accretive. The only reason a larger transaction wouldn’t be accretive, would be on a GAAP basis because of the amortization of customer relationship intangibles which we talked about quarter-on-quarter, year-over-year since 2006, of being, kind of a false negative relative to the underlying financial enterprise that we're building here.\", 'Jason Seidl', \"Okay. And, I’ll ask one more here, Bohn, just on a go away from M&A, and a little bit more towards [indiscernible]. We heard Landstar today talk about September having less than seasonal trends that are out there. Just, they're obviously 100% in the spot market. Just curious what you're seeing here in September right now, at Radiant.\", 'Bohn Crain', \"Landstar is a little more aggressive in their forward-looking comments than I choose to be. So, I think, -- I'll put it this way. I think, this quarter ended June for us is indicative of the run rate or earnings power of the business. We have a little bit of seasonality that kind of rolls through our business. But, all-in-all, I think, we're in the best position we've ever been in to handle whatever is coming our way. And, we're focused on growing our business.\", 'Jason Seidl', 'So, basically, the trends that you saw this most recent quarter are more or less intact?', 'Bohn Crain', \"That's true.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Campbell of Thompson Davis. Please state your question.', 'David Campbell', \"Hi Bohn, Hi Todd. Bohn, I’m a bit surprised -- I'm little bit surprised in this environment of soft trucking business that you haven't been able to find attractive acquisitions, smaller acquisitions that would fit into your agent network. And secondly, I haven’t heard you talk about converting any agents to Company-owned offices, which I think would be more likely to happen in a soft environment than a strong environment. So, I'm a little surprised with that. Can you help us out at all on why you haven’t found anything? \", 'Bohn Crain', \"Well, yes, a couple comments. One, just because I haven't told you that I have doesn't mean I haven’t, one. And two, our -- and probably a good kind of level set for everybody on the call, as we think about converting our agent stations to Company-owned stores, we are here to support our operating partners to effectively provide them their exit strategies when they're ready, not when we're ready, but when they're ready. So, we try to meet them where they want to be met in terms of agent station conversions. With that said, none of us are getting any younger, including kind of the demographics of our agent station owner partners. And I do believe, over time, kind of the rate of conversion will increase. And, we certainly are talking to folks across the categories that you are referencing. We’re constantly talking to tuck-in type acquisitions, both internal and external to our network. It’s just we have not chose to conclude one just yet.\", 'David Campbell', \"And second question is, on the freight forwarding business, especially the international freight forwarding business, I know, you had substantial success in the Philadelphia in that acquisition some years ago and the business had brought you I guess in the transatlantic market -- the Atlantic market has been stronger than the Pacific. So, I'm surprised, that your freight forwarding hasn’t done relatively better than it has. Is that -- do I understand the situation, or can you explain better?\", 'Bohn Crain', 'You might have us confused with somebody else relative to your reference to our acquisition of a large Philadelphia operations because -- I mean, we have done a small agent tuck-in action in Philadelphia some years ago, it was one of the SBA agency stations that we acquired before we ultimately acquired Service By Air. But, I think, on an absolute basis on a year-over-year basis, international is up quite nicely. This most immediate quarter, there were some softness in international. But, it’s hard to pinpoint whether that was -- whether that’s a slowdown, whether that was a pull forward to try to accelerate to get ahead of the tariffs. It’s a little I think premature to ultimately draw conclusions to see what’s going to happen on the international side. And at the same time, ocean continues -- historically, ocean was one of our smallest modes of transportation. And our ocean is growing. From a modality standpoint, it probably remains one of our fastest growing segments. So, while the kind of the decrease in revenues for the quarter was driven in part by international for the year, international was up meaningfully.', 'David Campbell', 'Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll let someone else have it.', 'Bohn Crain', 'All right. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'There appear to be no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.', 'Bohn Crain', 'All right. Thank you.', 'Let me close by saying that we remain very excited with our progress and prospects here at Radiant, and we remain very bullish on the growth platform that we’ve created and the scalability of our non-asset based business model. Our now more than 12-year first-to-market advantage and executing our multi-brand strategy and consolidating agent-based freight forwarding networks, ongoing investment in technology and low leverage on our balance sheet, puts us in a unique position to support further consolidation in the marketplace. We believe this represents a longer term and almost perpetual opportunity, and we continue to invest in the technology and our people with an eye towards building out a world-class, scalable back office infrastructure to support a much larger enterprise going forward.', 'We’re patiently persistent in the pursuit of this long-term vision, which we believe over time will deliver meaningful value for our shareholders, our operating partners, and the end customers that we serve.

We caution that such statements are based on management's assumptions and beliefs and are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. I refer you to our news release and MD&A for more information on these assumptions and factors.\", 'I will now turn the call over to Michael Medline.', 'Michael Medline', 'Thank you, Katie. And good afternoon, everyone. We are again pleased with our results this quarter. Our momentum continues. Sunrise costs are coming under the business. The team is executing more sharply. Our strategic initiatives are all progressing well. And we continue to improve EBITDA margin. Other than the IFRS accounting changes, it was a pretty clean and straightforward quarter. EPS was $0.49 this quarter, $0.12 higher than last year. And if you remove a few one time impacts of last Q1 and this Q1, it would be more than a 75% improvement. Sales rough in all regions in across all banners. It is still early days but we are pleased with the sales we are seeing from our seven FreshCo stores in the west. ', 'Farm Boy continues to post excellent sales. Same store sales were 2.4% with customer account and basket size both up. We have lapped the healthcare reform impacts last year which rendered the impact of pharmacy same store sales immaterial this quarter. Internal inflation was approximately 3%. We saw a dip in tonnage with the slow start to summer weather-wise notably in May and that appeared to impact the whole market especially in Eastern and Western Canada. Temperatures were nowhere near seasonal norms and affected summer seasonal categories like cold beverages, ice cream, condiments and summer fruit.', \"While tonnage is commonly used as an indicator of market share internally, we have several different data points that we use to look at market share at more granular levels. Based on these additional data points, we held our market share at least steady this quarter even without counting our Farm Boy acquisition market share gains. So all-in-all, I thought our team did a good job on comps. And as you can see from our margins, we didn't buy sales. In fact, we were purposefully a little less promotional this summer, as our promotions continue to become more effective that gives our customers a great experience with a more relevant offer, provides a good lift for us and reduces the amount of money we spend on promotions.\", \"Gross margin rate was up 120 basis points from Q1 last year. Category resets continue to expand our margin as anticipated. And on top of that normal operational margin management by our merchant team was very good. This is our first quarter reporting IFRS 16; it's created some noise that Mike will explain. I will note that our pre IFRS 16 EBITDA margin, pre IFRS increased 60 basis points over Q1 last year that's apples to apples. We continue to close the gap on our competitors. \", \"As we greatly improve execution and continue to unlock Empire's cash generating potential, we believe that it is imperative to return cash to our shareholders. Last quarter, we increased our dividend and announced that we would be repurchasing shares. This quarter we repurchased about 550,000 shares for approximately $19 million and we remain committed to our $100 million target first fiscal 2020. We continue to make good progress against our major strategic initiatives. We are in the final year of our Sunrise transformation and this initiative is progressing even better than we originally anticipated.\", 'We may remain on track to achieve a savings target of at least $550 million, $50 million more than what we originally announced over two years ago. In store execution of category resets which will drive a large portion of our total Sunrise savings is nearly complete. Our teammates and our stores have done a great job realigning our stores, tranche by tranche, ensuring our sales are stocked with the items customers want most.', 'All of our reporting and customer feedback to date indicates that in-store execution of resets has been very well received. We continue to expand our FreshCo banner in the West and to date have opened five stores in British Columbia including two ethnic oriented shallow FreshCo stores and another two stores in Winnipeg. We are pleased with how the stores are performing and that our customers are excited. Our marketing team has done a great job driving awareness and will continue building the FreshCo brand in the West. ', 'Our expansion a FreshCo to the West allows us to participate in the growing discount segment by converting 25% of our poor performance to Safeway and Sobeys stores, the FreshCo stores and markets that are better suited to discount. We remain on track to open 11 additional FreshCo stores throughout the remainder of fiscal 2020. Our strategy to grow share in Ontario where we have historically had a low market share, continues to progress well. We are seeing stronger results and our existing Sobeys FreshCo and food land banners and we continue to see improved sales and customer metrics as we convert all FreshCo stores to the new FreshCo 2.0 model. ', \"Our acquisition of Farm Boy gives us a winning format that will allow us to accelerate our growth in urban and suburban markets in Ontario. Farm Boy has been part of the Empire family for just over 10-months now and continues to build on its industry-leading operational and customer metrics. The team at Farm Boy is making progress against our plan to double the size of the business in the next five years. We currently have concrete plans to open another three Farm Boy stores in fiscal 2020, and two in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Farm Boy's access to our Empire real estate prowess has allowed us to accelerate development of Farm Boy in high-quality locations.\", 'Voila, our game-changing e-commerce solution will also position us to accelerate our growth in the GTA.

Winning the next generation of retail will require both extraordinary execution and smart strategic innovation. In parallel with its strategic initiatives, we have underway; we are positioning the company to innovate for the long term.

We are hard at work on finalizing strategy, detailed roadmap and financial goals for the three years post Sunrise to ensure this momentum continues. We see a lot of runway ahead of us. And with that over to Mike.', 'Michael Vels', 'Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone. As Michael said, we are pleased with our margin performance this quarter as margin dollars increased again due to higher sales, and more importantly an increase in margin rate of 120 basis points. The two main drivers of this margin rate expansion were category reset benefits and the inclusion of Farm Boy which has a higher margin rate than the rest of the business. If we were to normalize for mixed effects of higher sales and lower margin businesses like Quebec and wholesale the impact would be even higher.', 'Sales were positively impacted this quarter by the inclusion of Farm Boy and inflation. Produce specifically was a big driver of prices and sales during the quarter. Weather and increased costs increased prices that also lowered the amount of units available for sale. Excluding produce on an apples-to-apples basis comparison, tonnage was marginally positive. Consistent with last year, sales price variable SG&A expenses up mostly in store labor. SG&A as percent of sales after removing the impact of IFRS 16 was 50 basis points higher than last year.', \"This was due to the inclusion of Farm Boy's higher labor cost model impact, non-recurring impairment reversals in the prior year, and closure costs associated with the announcement of 10 new FreshCo locations and conversion of two of our own stores to new Farm Boy stores. These costs amounted to $21 million before taxes related to severance, inventory and asset write-downs or about $0.06 per share after tax. These costs are in addition to the $10 million we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 aligned with our West discount expansion plan to open 10 to 15 FreshCo locations per year over the next three years.\", 'Project Sunrise is on track. And we continue to estimate incremental savings of about $250 million in fiscal 2020 spread evenly across the year. We continue to be on track with about 25% of the incremental benefits recognized in this quarter with roughly 8% gross margin and 20% SG&A. These savings comes largely from category resets, indirect sourcing cost reductions and store improvements. Equity earnings decreased over the prior year primarily due to prior year disposable properties by Crombie that increased our share of their earnings last year by approximately $0.02 per share after-tax.', 'As a reminder, Crombie has announced a significant sale transaction that will occur in May that will positively impact our second quarter 2020 results. The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% and we continue to estimate that excluding the impact of any unusual transactions or differential tax rates on property sales, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 will be between 26% and 28%.', 'Free cash flow continues to be strong at $224.2 million this quarter reflective of increased earnings. The strength of our cash flows has enabled us to reinvest back into the business in a disciplined manner, positively impacting our customers in store and enabling better technology and processes in our back offices. In the first quarter, we touched over 50 stores through renovation, redevelopment or conversion. Our strong cash flows, sustainable margin improvements and improving credit metrics were a factor in the decision by DBRS to upgrade Sobeys credit rating to BBB low with a stable trend and for S&P to upgrade Sobeys outlook from stable to positive.', \"IFRS 16 was adopted for the first time this quarter. You'll notice several changes in your external documents specifically you can see the impact on key metrics on pages 7and 13, 17 and 18 of the MD&A. Our documents reinforce that this is an accounting and measurement change only and it had no impact on our cash generating ability. We have provided an outline of the extent of the change on each of our key metrics on page 2 of the press release and page 7 of the MD&A.\", 'A few key metrics to highlight are EBITDA. EBITDA margin and free cash flow. EBITDA increased by $129 million mostly due to their removal of rate expense which was replaced as depreciation expense and net financed expenses. Neither of which are captured in this metric. EBITDA margin as we report it was 6.8% for the quarter, pre IFRS 16, it would have been 4.9% an improvement of 60 basis points over the prior year.', \"The free cash flow definition has been updated to ensure accountability with the prior year. We will continue to show you the quarterly impact of IFRS 16 for the remainder of fiscal 2020 as we start to get used to the new metrics which will now be the new normal for the Canadian industry. Although, we will of course continue to have metric that are inconsistent with US peers who report under US GAAP. The first quarter was a solid. We're off to a good start. The team feels confident about our packed agenda for this year that includes the completion of Sunrise. The continuation of the FreshCo expansion in the West, increasing Farm Boy's footprint in Ontario and launching Voila by Sobeys.\", \"And with that I'll hand the call back to Katie for questions.\", 'Katie Brine', 'Thank you, Mike. Joanna, you may open the line for questions at this time. ', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] ', 'And your first question is from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'KarenShort', 'Thanks. I want to just ask about the cadence of tonnage throughout the quarter excluding produce. And obviously I asked because the weather had an impact. So wondering if you give a little color there. Then I had a couple other questions.', 'MichaelMedline', 'Sure. The three periods, the first was the weaker as the summer took time to get going and progressively improved through the next two months. ', 'KarenShort', 'So it include -- so once we got to the final month that you would have been much more positive not just marginally for the entire quarter on tonnage. ', 'MichaelMedline', 'Well more positive relatively speaking. As Michael said we had a slightly lighter promotions schedule this year. So we were -- if you have to pick one of the two metrics probably little more focused on margin than growing tonnage and sales.', 'KarenShort', \"Okay and then I guess just curious in terms of the competitive landscape in light of the high produce inflation because it sounds like that's continuing into the second quarter. Has the environment changed at all in the second quarter from a competitive perspective?\", 'MichaelMedline', \"We don't anticipate a big changes except if we have some commodity seeing bigger inflation. So when the inflation is, the build it just in some commodity then we can see some change in trends, but in general I think it's pretty stable quarter after quarter in terms of inflation and produce. So, no, we won't anticipate big change going forward.\", 'KarenShort', 'Okay and then any way you could quantify the impact of Farm Boy and also produce on growth margins.', 'MichaelMedline', \"Farm Boy is obviously positive. It just -- their operating model is because of the mix in their business runs at a higher margin rate. We've not disclosed the exact basis points as it is competitive. But they also run in a higher SG&A percentage. All told at the bottom line their EBITDA percentage on an apples-to-apples basis would be higher than the consolidated Sobeys numbers.\", 'KarenShort', 'Okay and then last question for me on data analytics. Would you be willing to just give a little color on how your approach might change going forward on the analytic front?', 'MichaelVels', \"Yes. Hi, it's Michael. We're -- like we're not going to get overzealous on it. We're going to take it in stride and key on some very important big prizes especially on the merchandising side behind the scenes and personalization on the front. Any more than that I'd rather not give to you but I can tell you that we're going to keep the team small and focused on the big prizes, not spread ourselves too thin on this.\", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Vishal Shreedhar from National Bank. Please go ahead.', 'VishalShreedhar', \"Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I'm wondering if you could provide any early color on project Sunrise 2.0, if there are any comments you can share. And if you can't maybe you can help us on when you might share some of the details on that.\", 'MichaelMedline', \"Hi, how are you doing, Vishal. It's Michael. And we're working through the strategy right now. Our intention this time is to share what we can with you. And as you know, we try to share as much as we can be transparent in the spring, having chosen when in the spring to share that we're still working on it. But I can tell you that we're not just beginning this work. We're right in the middle of it. And we're going to have very aggressive goals to grow our year-over-year earnings numbers as we go forward. I don't think --I don't want anybody think we're going to take a holiday after Sunrise. Sunrise 2.0 and I thought what it's going to be called will be aggressive.\", 'VishalShreedhar', \"Okay. Empire has implemented a lot of change in a short period of time. And I know you have a lot more initiatives planned and you've given us insight into some of them. But just wondering as you look at the organization today from when you come in, would you say that the restructuring is effectively complete at this stage? And you can pull on a lever and understand how the organization will respond to you or is there still a higher degree of uncertainty associated with let's say a company that's running on a normal basis?\", 'MichaelMedline', \"It's night and day. And as I said in the AGM speech, which I would guess most you didn't listen to today. I guess you got better things to do and you're busy to hear my speech is as I said; we planned a rock solid foundation. Now this company it can execute and operate and take on more and more projects and people have accountability. The team, the structure works. We're probably doing you know me a little bit, Vishal, we'll do a little tweaking below the executive level make sure it works really, really well across our different functions.\", \"We've got the people in place. They're working well together. I am even a little surprised that this team is offering such a high level at this point. I would have thought probably we might be 6 or 12-months ahead of where we would have thought two and half years ago. Now that doesn't mean that that we don't have work to do. We do. And that people are settling into their new portfolios. Pierre is key, he keep saying that I don't know where I'll end up because I can't give him much more than this without me leaving right away. But he's a just doing a great job in terms of taking out Quebec and then merchandiser and again operation and how he works with finance and marketing and across the whole company.\", \"So couldn't be happier with the structure and the people and when we pull the rope it works like as you were asking. \", 'VishalShreedhar', \"Okay. Thanks for that color. And just wondering from a consumer standpoint a little bit more concern out there than usual. Just wondering what you're seeing? And if you're seeing uncertainty macro headlines permeating to the customer.\", 'MichaelMedline', \"Yes. I think I'll start then Pierre closer to some of that than I am because of his operational and merchandising perspective. But we're not seeing anything as of this point out in the market that would indicate consumer malaise or over-worried. Like everyone out there we are concerned about some of the things we're seeing on the horizon. And we certainly hope that there won't be a recession because that costs people jobs. Same time grocery performs awfully well in recessionary periods, but not as but we'd rather the economy was doing well. But we're not seeing much and Pierre maybe you could give a little bit more color if you could.\", 'PierreStLaurent', \"I think consumers looking; they're trying to remain the same. And you are reading stuff like we do. And we need to be more relevant. The society is changing, you have less time everything so that's the thing that these big trends continue and I think we anticipate no major changes going forward except some economic changes. But once again in difficult times it's always an opportunity to differentiate ourself and we're ready for it.\", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Irene Nattel from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'IreneNattel', \"Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Just on the category reset just wondering as time goes on how are you seeing performance evolve or mature of some of the early categories that you did versus the later ones? And as you've taken all those learnings, do you think that you need to kind of go back and do any mini resets of the early categories?\", 'MichaelVels', 'I think, Irene, I think the short answer is no because we went through a very rigorous and fairly identical process for all of the rollouts. And including every category that gets rolled out goes through a pilot store approach as part of its cycle. And as we got into the stores we have post got better and learned from each successive week and anything that we felt could have been improved in the early categories would already have been executed from a negotiations perspective that was done in a very compressed timeframe in a number of very tightly controlled ways. ', \"We're very satisfied with the outcomes and those are being executed as expected. As we move forward next year post Sunrise, I think we've said pretty consistently that we did a lot in a short period of time. And with a new team and now under Pierre's leadership and more miles in the saddle, there's clearly going to be more fine-tuning and opportunities in all of our category management. And we expect to capture that as we move forward post Sunrise. And it's more business as usual. We're actually very satisfied with the quality of execution.\", 'MichaelMedline', \"And just maybe I'll just add two things which is we were, I think we've been really pleasantly surprised that the pre work we did in terms of understanding the customer and what to do in each category and which products would resonate the most. We've seen our merchants pretty well nailed that very, very few changes after we put the category reset and I can't think of one off the top of my head because there's so few.\", \"The second is Mike's right that once we're done categories that we got to go and find more optimization. And I think a lot of that will come from the data analytics and AI that Pierre is working on right now.\", 'IreneNattel', \"That's great. That's really helpful. And I guess that brings me to my next question which is as you think about whatever you decide to call it, I know project daylight, will --what are the key elements that you see now that you really, really would like to get at in the next three-year plan?\", 'MichaelMedline', \"We're still working on it, but I think it gets clearer. You guys can do the math that we closed the SG&A gaps quite a bit on our two major competitors. And we have a long way to go and so we've got it. There's a little bit to go on that not too much, but we'll get at that. And I think that we have a large prize on cost of goods sold even now, even with all the work recording the progress we've had. And the third piece that we're looking at is having more productivity in store and getting those sales per square foot up. When we look at our GAAP to being best-in-class in the country, it's mostly going to be a combination of cogs and sales per square feet, all of -- but it's not some but it's not without plans.\", \"I think we can go and improve those sales per square feet against our competitors in a very smart fashion while taking out some of the cost. So we've got some more work to do in terms of the road map and which order we're going to tackle it and make sure our resources are there. And we don't overspend because we aren't going back to the old days. So that's what we're doing, but the pride is there. I think it's a matter now of prioritizing, putting our financial goals clearly in front of us. And then having a just with a road map. I'm a simple person. When something works you go back to it. \", \"And I think that we can, why sometimes I refer to it is project Sunrise 2.0. We couldn't do everything in a three-year period, just couldn't do it. We had to get the infrastructure and the people in place and came into the process. Now we can go, let's go finish the job. And I think that's what the next three years will be.\", 'IreneNattel', \"And just final question leading on from that. Do you see any need from us or a technology perspective? Do you see any need to strengthen the platform? Do any significant investments there or you're okay for now.\", 'MichaelVels', \"Rather than answer the question in absolutes, I think the short answer is maybe long answer is that our systems are stable. And they produce the answers to a large extent that you ask them to do, but it's with some difficulty and they're not as nimble and as focused towards robust data and analytics as you'd expect from a company of our size and complexity. So we will be investing more and for sure at higher levels than what companies you now over the last three or four years in IT. But it's not going to be directed at changing the basic infrastructure as much as adding new capabilities such as artificial intelligence, analytics capabilities, loyalty, personalization much better data arrays. So that our merchants can rely on the data and see it on their desktops as opposed to having it put together on a periodic basis by finance people.\", \"So it's kind of exciting investments executed over a period of years, but it really focused on the insatiable requests and desires of our merchants and others for a better analytics and better insights.\", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Michael Van Aelst from TD Securities. Please go ahead.', 'MichaelVanAelst', \"Hi. On the Voila program that launching in the next spring. So you're talking about a soft launch or a test launch in late spring. When would you expect a full complete rollout in the GTA?\", 'MichaelMedline', \"Hi, Michael. Great question. What recent path is you get it right before you go to a large group of customers? So difficult to call or we don't think the test and soft launch should go for too long a period of time. But we're going to, well, if we're not happy with how we're progressing and we expect to be happy then we'll slow it down kind of tiny bit and rollout but we're going to roll it out postal code anyway. So what we put in our plans and they've always been there from since the very beginning, so that's actually the work that Sarah is leading, it's going really, really well right now is that spring test and soft launch, my experience is you go when you're ready because you've got one chance to knock the cover off the ball and thrill the customer and take the eyeballs or mouthfuls in this case, and that's what we're going to do.\", \"So I don't want to commit to anything other than when we go to customers. This is going to knock their socks off, but everything is looking good so far, Michael.\", 'MichaelVanAelst', \"But once you figure it out and you say, okay, the test off launch has gone exactly how you're expecting and you've got it nailed. How long does it take to roll out postal code by postal code?\", 'MichaelMedline', 'It will take; they will take a few months. ', 'MichaelVanAelst', 'And the FreshCo in Western Canada is any way you could give us an idea of the relative performance to either the FreshCo in Eastern Canada or in Ontario story or the FreshCo in Western Canada.', 'MichaelVels', \"Sure. It's a little different buy market as we rolled out. But our investment has been fairly significant in marketing and promotions to make sure that we set the right price in back to -- in customer's minds. This clearly been some competitive response. Having said that the sales that we've seen across the system are in fact higher than the Safeway stores, which they replaced pre opening. So we've been very pleased about that because it does mean that we've attracted new customers. And in addition to that the conventional stores that we have in those market areas continue to do well as well.\", \"So we've clearly generated net new sales for the company which was one of our goals. From a profitability perspective, I would venture to say that it's at this stage roughly neutral and mostly because it's a relatively small number of stores. And we didn't expect it obviously to be accretive in the early days. So from the Western perspective lower margins because we're ramping up our people. We have more trading. We have more people in the stores as they get more effective and more efficient and understand how to run a discount store we will see those costs coming down.\", \"Our promotional intensity as we start to get a little more mature with the store is starting to lessen. And we expect to see steadily increasing margins in the banner. In terms of your question on the Ontario balance, our sales continue to be very strong in our discount business very satisfied with them, the new formats, the FreshCo 2.0 continues to do well. And we don't want to, we said, I think we've rolled it out to something like 45 stores to date. I'm very satisfied with the outcomes. Our franchisees are happy. So clearly two different markets, Michael, one's a startup and one's a mature market with some new concepts being rolled out. Obviously, the profitability in the Ontario market higher than Western at this.\", 'MichaelVanAelst', 'Okay. And the roll out in Western Canada to the 65 stores or so, do you expect to have that done by the end of fiscal 2022? Is that their timing? ', 'MichaelVels', \"Yes. We are saying over the next three years. So I'd say fiscal 2022 early into the next year. It's -that's the current plan. And so far we've kept to the cadence that we anticipated. We don't see anything at this stage that should slow us down. So I think that would be a reasonable estimate.\", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Patricia Baker from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.', 'PatriciaBaker', \"Thank you very much for taking my questions. Michael in your opening remarks you reference the fact that the teams are executing more sharply and certainly that's showing up in the numbers and you can actually see it when you go to the stores. And one area that you referenced here in discussion of the gross margin was in promotional effectiveness. I'd really like you to talk about that if you don't mind a little bit more. So where are you in the journey of trying to drive better promotional effectiveness? When did you start? Are you looking at promotional effectiveness now more through a return lens and requiring that the promotions meet basic return hurdles? And, if so, if you are doing it that way is that a change in your approach?\", \"And I'm assuming that the size of the prize of getting to the optimal promotional effectiveness is pretty big for you guys.\", 'MichaelMedline', \"Sorry, that was, we're now in Scotia but I don't think we could blame the hurricane but our lines suddenly went down. It wasn't because I was nervous about your question. I don't think Patricia but let's hear -- sorry about that. \", 'PatriciaBaker', \"Neither do I, Michael. Okay. Sorry and it's a long one and I apologize to anybody who has to listen to it again, but you're both. So in your opening remarks you talked about the fact that the teams are executing more sharply and you can see that in the numbers. You can see that if you walk the stores and in one area which showed up in this quarter, you're referenced here in discussion of gross margins on promotional effectiveness. And so I would really like to talk about that a little bit more maybe talk about where you are on that journey? When did you really seriously start to get to do the work on promotional effectiveness? And additionally, are you now looking at promotional effectiveness through a return mirror and requiring that promotions actually meet some return hurdle? And if that's the case, is that a new approach?\", 'MichaelVels', \"So not a new approach. While we changed our structure and many merchants and all of their supporting teams which is just equally important ended up new categories, a large job to do through Sunrise. At the same time, we still have many very experienced and very capable merchants who are running complex categories across the country. And on an individual and collective basis they know what they're doing. They understand the necessity to balance margin and sales. And certainly Michael's very clear directive coming in over two years ago was margin counts. \", \"It really counts because that's what we put on the bottom line. And we need to get more discipline and we need to get more focused on making sure that we're making smart decisions. And then that message has been reinforced by Pierre as he has taken over more and more responsibility and now basically controls the merchandising decisions across the entire country except for Farm Boy and discount. And so I'd say, no, it's not new. But what's changed now is that we are really through the Sunrise rollout. The merchants have access to better tools and analytics than they did two years ago.\", \"We have -- they've solidified into a new team with a strong leader. And we're turning our eyes towards what maybe day to day category management and balancing that sales and margin equation. At the same time as we've referred to previously, we are investing quite heavily in new analytics and new data models to up our gain in terms of measuring. And then ultimately helping us with the execution in proportional effectiveness. So it's, I guess ,what I'm trying to say is it has been a progression. There's not a sudden sea change, but as Sunrise progresses matures completes, we just have -- we have more material and more tools to deal with. And we're going to get ever better on promotion. So I don't Pierre if there's anything you want to add to that. \", 'PierreStLaurent', \"Very well said. The only other thing I would like to add is the category set exercise gave a very good knowledge of every single category to merchants. So I think they had a better ownership and understanding on every single category or SKU to handle in their proper planning. And like Michael said, our goal, we were more focused on structural change and now we're more focused on day to day business. So with that help with good guidelines, the team is more focused and more disciplined than ever. And I think there's still room for improvement for sure. But compared to Q1 last year, the balance between sales growth and margin expansion is a great success in only 12- months old as you compare to last year Q1 and now. I would like to congratulate the team; they pass through a big change structurally. And now they really are more focused on the day to day business.\", 'PatriciaBaker', \"That's very, very helpful, Pierre. And just on the category reset, you said that you're almost complete, so will that be completed in Q2?\", 'MichaelVels', 'Finally complete probably close to Q3 but by the time we get out of Q2, we are substantively done in terms of store roll out. ', 'PatriciaBaker', 'Okay. And just Michael you mentioned the hurricanes, just curious did you have in some store closures in the Hurricane. And were able to quickly get merchandise back on the shelf because I understand there was certainly a lot of people hording product before the Saturday?', 'MichaelMedline', \"Yes. I mean, we, our stores got wiped out in the two preceding days especially in Pictou County, all up and down where the eye was going to hit. Our customers came to us because they need to get things and we were there for them. We did a really good job of pre stocking those stores; carry more water and other items that are essential in those situations. The answer is that, yes, that many of our stores were closed. Some for a short period of time; some for longer; good news is very little structural damage to the stores. So that it shouldn't have any ongoing impact on us to restock stores that have essentially sold out in many, many categories takes some days. Although, our supply chain and operators throughout beginning, during, after have been sensational.\", 'Although, we sold a lot at the beginning, I think it hurts you actually on the back end of it because some of the closures and try to restock all the products back in the stores. But all -in-all, I think compared to a lot of people we came through unscathed. ', 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Peter Sklar from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'PeterSklar', \"Question on inflation. Your quarterly report it was just facilitated, you had a good 3% tailwind from inflation. Just wondering now that you're halfway through the second quarter, I assume you're seeing that level of inflation decelerating somewhat, is there anything you can comment about that?\", 'MichaelVels', \"I'm not sure I would - it was hard to say it's decelerating. At this point, it's early maybe pretty consistent I would say, but turning to tell where the quarter is going to enter.\", 'PeterSklar', \"And then Michael, I had a question for you. In terms of your brand positioning or brand messaging of Sobeys and Ontario, I thought I detected a subtle shift on how you're positioning the brand. Like for example, I noticed the gone fishing advertisements that are little bit different than what Sobeys has typically done. I'm just wondering have you suddenly shifted the brand messaging and was that based on, I know you did some consumer research in terms of trying to understand who Sobeys customer is is?\", 'MichaelMedline', \"Yes. I mean picked up on a great point. And I mean the brand is the brand and you make changes to it. When we did the customer research, the underlying love of a lot of Canadians for the Sobeys brand was there. And what we were trying to do is uncover it. I'd say compared to almost a brand I've ever seen the level of support, how they think of Sobeys as the family kind of grocery store. The place and what we weren't doing and we're doing now is we're executing better and living up to some of that brand reputation.\", \"But we're also telling --we really own in on that message which resonates better with our customers and it's really what Sobeys stands for. So I'd say that when you see, I think that fishing ad, I would have pointed that out is absolutely emblematic of what we're going for and that Sandra and the marketing team working with the other executives, I think it really nailed with the brand stands for and what we're going to stand for. Great customer feedback on all the measurements to do with that at. But and you also see much -- many of the things that we're going to do in terms of marketing and sponsorship, community activities are going to be resonate better with Sobeys.\", \"At the same time, we're also doing, well, actually Sandra, her team doing a lot of work on the brand messaging for takeaway and for 50s and for food land. And so I think we're a little further ahead on the Sobeys, but not too far behind on the other banner. So that was -- I'm glad to hear that you notice that. \", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Mark Petrie from CIBC. Please go ahead.', 'MarkPetrie', \"Hey, good afternoon. I just want to ask about Farm Boy and just regarding the conversion of other banner locations. Can you talk about the size of the locations you're comfortable putting a Farm Boy in? And how the model can adapt as you push, presumably push the store size higher over time? I understand the recent announcement was a FreshCo was presumably there are larger Sobeys locations that would be really well suited to Farm Boy concept.\", 'MichaelVels', 'The answer on that part is interesting, Mark. The format has until recently been in very small footprint such as the one in the Rideau Center in Ottawa, which is been a smallest one to 28,000-30,000 feet at the top end, but we are looking at some new stores including one in Ottawa which is going to test the upper limit of that box size. And look at putting some new and innovative ideas into a little more square footage. I think the great thing about the concept is that it is very flexible. The mix stays the same but the flexibility and fixtures and the layout is such that it does fit into and is very successful in a wide range of flow plates.', \"So unlike I say for your Sobeys or FreshCo, we don't have as tight a range for where how that format would work as you might think.\", 'MichaelMedline', \"The only thing I'd add before anyone jumps on me, these were Jean Louis and Jeff's idea is going to be and try different size formats which they think they can really execute upon. And but keep that fantastic brand and everything you're trying to do there. I think that if they were on the call, J-L and Jeff would tell you that that the promise of our real estate team and some of that what we had, I mean there's one at Yonge - Eglinton that's going to be a Farm Boy like everyone knows that probably already. That was going to be a Sobeys. We, it'll be a little larger than prototype Farm Boy, but they're going to, I think it's --that's just situated better to be a Farm Boy store and in that area. And we're seeing all sorts of opportunities that these are being driven by J-L and Jeff directing the work and the decision making in terms of what they're comfortable with to make sure they can be even greater than they have been before, but working with our real estate group and our executives, it's working real well.\", 'MarkPetrie', \"Okay, thanks for that. And with regards to SG&A, could you just talk about how you sort of think about the longer term or at least through the course of fiscal 2020 sort of growth rate in SG&A? Obviously, there's no shortage of areas where you do want to spend particularly on the brand awareness side across banners as you as you commented. And FreshCo West and Voila over time, so does that sort of require a pickup in spending or consuming a more of the Sunrise savings or do you have the ability to shift spending from other parts of the business and sort of keep on the current run rate?\", 'MichaelVels', \"I don't think I would walk away with an assumption that we have to ramp up our SG&A spend. So take out the impact of Farm Boy, the distortion of the last year one time positive we had in our numbers. And the closure costs this quarter. We, I'd say that on an ongoing basis, we're going to continue to be very focused on cost control. And I think it would be wrong to say that we anticipate a significant ramp up is in our SG&A activity or spend to support what we want to get done. As Michael said, we still actually think we have some more opportunity and some more capability to close that SG&A gap. Not quite as much as we do in the big line on cogs and sales.\", 'So I think you can expect us to continue to be very, very focused on becoming more efficient on that line, not less as the year progresses.', 'MarkPetrie', 'Okay and then you sort of answered this question I guess in a few different ways, but I just want to ask it specifically about sort of the regional structure and then the shift of merchandising functions in two different offices. I guess that was sort of a year and a half ago now really, but looking back on it now is there anything you would do differently and what sort of learnings have you pulled from that experience either sort of suggesting future opportunity or things that you want to kind of de-risk?', 'MichaelVels', \"I think through the gather reset exercise, we work together all format, all region together. We remain mainly we have our grocery team or inter standards they are the fresh team in Toronto, we remain the team, we keep --we kept the year the team in Quebec. And now we are more focusing on the format and so we have merchandizing people across the country to be close to customer needs which is a good thing. And but the teams are working together because they had to execute reset together, so and now reset is over but reviewing category that will be a continuous thing that it's now our processes now and we have a national governance for all formats all region. \", \"So we learned from, we took the best and we lost the worst. We're working together. We are focused on regional needs and we kept the best people across the country. So honestly it's the best of two worlds. And we leveraging the size of the company and we remain close to customers.\", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Keith Howlett from Desjardins. Please go ahead.', 'KeithHowlett', 'Yes. I wondered if you could update us on your work on private label.', 'MichaelVels', \"Do we update on private label. We reviewed the branding, the look and feel of the brand. I think we use some new look and feel the new compliment logo and everything. I think the new logo will fit better in our shelf. It would be -- we have a better view on the each product in our shelf is the goal behind that. And the best thing is a true category set, we revised for every single category, a specific role for our private label in some category private label would play a specific role in another different role. And so I think it's a bigger thing we did over the last year. And we are seeing already positive result by having I would say stronger joint business plan between our national banners our private label private label going forward specific role to play in a category.\", \"So it's where we are. The new image will be finished by the end of this fiscal year. So it's a plan. It's already started and we finish -- it's a 35 under product that we need to redesign the packaging and everything plus a couple of new products for sure.\", 'KeithHowlett', 'Then I just was wondering on the square footage in terms of the doubling of Farm Boy over the next five years, how do you anticipate that will break down between conversions of existing Sobeys or FreshCo real estate versus Greenfield?', 'MichaelMedline', \"Well, I think that you're going to -- we don't really say what percentage is which but I think it's going to be a combination, most of the square footage will be greenfield but where we see an opportunity where a Farm Boy fits better than our current banner we're going to make that conversion. And I think that I think that the only thing constraining us from even higher growth of Farm Boy is to make sure that they can handle that kind of growth and there are a certain number of stores in the next couple years that we wouldn't go over because we just want them to get their feet under them. At the same time, I think that there are more opportunities should Farm Boy be ready for them to greenfield more stores maybe faster than we originally thought when we made the acquisition and there probably a few more stores that could be converted especially in the densest parts of Toronto that we're going to go forward.\", 'KeithHowlett', 'And then just on the FreshCo banner. How did, I know you may not want to speak this but how do the Chalo FreshCo work in British Columbia versus say the normal FreshCo?', 'MichaelMedline', \"The Chalo that we've opened, a couple we've opened in Western Canada are is actually one the strongest because we've only opened a handful of stores, but if we're happy with the FreshCo we're extra happy with the Chalo. I think they're very, I think our FreshCo offering overall is differentiated and our Chalo is even more differentiated than that market. They stand out even more the would in Ontario and so in fact we we're just talking about that today how pleased you are at the cello in Ontario. And so in fact we are just talking about that today. Hopefully the Chalo in Ontario and in the West. \", 'End of Q&A', 'Operator', 'Thank you. There are no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.', 'I will now turn the conference over to your host, Rob Fink with FNK IR. Mr. Fink, you may begin.', 'Rob Fink', \"Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Park City Group's fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. Hosting the call today are Mr. Randy Fields, Park City Group's CEO and Chairman; and John Merrill, Park City Group's CFO.\", 'Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that this call could contain forward-looking statements about Park City Group within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not subject to historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statement.', \"Such risks are fully disclosed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information set forth herein should be considered in light of such risk. Park City Group does not assume any obligation to update information contained in this conference call.\", \"Shortly after the market close today, the company issued a press release overviewing the financial results that it will discuss on today's call. Investors can visit the Investor Relations section of the company's website parkcitygroup.com to access this news release.\", 'With all that said, I now like to turn the call over to John. John, the call is yours.', 'John Merrill', 'Thanks Rob.', \"As many of you know, I served as the CFO of Park City Group from 2006 to 2010. I rejoined the company in May of 2018 [ph] as the Senior Vice President of Finance to drive several strategic initiatives and was later appointed as CFO in May of this year. I'm truly excited to be back with PCG and ReposiTrak.\", \"I believe the company has come a long way in 10 years. Back then, we struggled to build a network with limited resources. We had opportunity but less financial strength. My days then were spent convincing prospects and customers we will be here. This is not the case today. The company's balance sheet and financial position today is the strongest it has ever been.\", 'Park City Group has a simple story, get retailers and their suppliers compliant, give them visibility to actionable information through our supply chain solutions, and allow the customers to source, vet, and transact business through marketplace. Then repeat, grow the network, and generate cash.', 'We service the largest industry sector of the economy. We have a growing blue-chip customer base. We leverage our regulatory environment that is increasingly complex with no end in sight, and we service an industry where high-volume, low margin customers are facing increasing competition and need help to reduce risk, improve efficiencies, and remain competitive, therein lies are sweet spot. Like Randy, I believe the true measure of a successful business is its earnings power and ability to generate cash flow.', \"With that, I would like to now review the financial results for the quarter and the full year of fiscal 2019. Fiscal fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 million, down from $6.3 million in the same quarter in 2018. The quarter-over-quarter comparison includes $1.5 million of nonrecurring sales that occurred in Q4 of 2018 that did not occur in the same period of 2019. Randy and I will discuss this in detail on today's call.\", 'However, our focus is on growing recurring revenue and placing less emphasis on nonrecurring revenue where it is avoidable. Obviously, the lifetime value of a subscription customer is far more valuable to a SaaS company and our shareholders than nonrecurring transactional revenue, but it comes with a quarterly impact. There will always be some percentage of our customers that will buy versus rent. Therefore, if it makes sense, the company may do a license if the customer demands it. In our view 33% of something today is worth more than 100% of nothing over traditional subscription term.', 'For fiscal 2019, annual revenues were $21.2 million compared to $22 million for the year ended June 30, 2018, a 4% decrease. This $800,000 decrease in total annual revenue was driven by lower nonrecurring revenue which decreased [indiscernible] from $8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 to $6 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.', 'The decrease in nonrecurring revenue was partially offset by growth in recurring revenue. Total recurring revenue increased 5% year-over-year. Total recurring revenue increased from 64% of total revenue to 70% of total revenue fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 respectively.', 'As previously stated, our goal is to drive recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue to 80% or more. However, we will always have customers that demand to buy meaning license versus rent meaning subscription.', 'Switching to operating expenses. For fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, total operating expenses declined from $5 million in Q4 2018 to $4.4 million in the same period in 2019. This 12% decrease in total operating expenses for the quarter or $600,000 is largely the result of lower expenses across the board. Lower Q4 expenses and cost of services and product support were due to lower marketplace.', \"Lower quarterly sales and marketing expenses were due to generally lower sales across all categories. Lower G&A costs were the result of cheaper rent in the company's headquarters, lower professional fees for accounting and legal, lower stock compensation expense, and other general and administrative costs. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, total operating expenses were down 7% from $18.5 million in fiscal 2018 to $17.2 million in the same period in fiscal 2019.\", \"Let's look at the annual expense numbers in a little bit more detail. Cost of services and product support. For fiscal year 2019, cost of services and product support was $5.8 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $6.6 million in fiscal 2018. Again, the year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower marketplace costs.\", 'Sales and marketing, for fiscal year 2019, sales and marketing expense decreased 6% to $6 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease in sales and marketing is due to decreases in sales costs in nearly every area.', \"G&A, for fiscal year 2019, general and administrative expenses was $4.7 million, down 3% from $4.9 million in fiscal 2018. This year-over-year decrease in general and administrative expense for the full year was primarily due to lower rent and CAM charges for the company's new headquarters, lower professional fees, and an overall decrease in stock compensation expense due to certain stock grants that are fully vested.\", \"Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was 601,000 for fiscal year 2019, down 5% from 634,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in D&A is due to certain hardware and other property and equipment that was fully depreciated. The company spent 1.5 million in leasehold improvements and computer hardware in fiscal 2019. This was the result of relocating the company's headquarters to a more cost-effective location and upgrading equipment in our data center.\", 'It should be noted that depreciation in subsequent periods will increase due to the depreciation of the capital expenditures made during fiscal 2019. Historically, our annual CapEx is trended in the $500,000 per year range. In fiscal 2020, we expect CapEx to return to this level, and even with the higher levels of investments in fiscal 2019, we still on average maintain this targeted level.', 'Turning now to net income, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we generated net income to common shareholders of $36,000 or $0.00 per diluted share compared to $1.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. The decrease in net income to common shareholders was the result of lower nonrecurring revenues offset to a lesser degree by lower operating expenses, and recognizing a loss on extinguishment of an interest in an investment for certain equipment.', 'For the full year of fiscal 2019, we generated net income to common shareholders of $3.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share, which was up 16% from $2.8 million or $0.14 per diluted share in fiscal 2018.', 'Turning now to cash flow and cash balances; for fiscal year 2019, cash flow from operations was $4.6 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior fiscal year, a 110% improvement. After capital investments of $1.5 million in fiscal 2019 for leasehold improvements for a new corporate facility and upgrading our data center, total cash at the end of fiscal 2019 was $18.6 million when compared to $14.9 million in the same period in 2018.', 'I want to point out that the $18.6 million cash balance also reflects the nearly 500,000 in common stock we purchased under the stock buyback plan. 87,600 shares were purchased at an average price of $5.47 per share in May and June of 2019.', 'The total amount remaining under the buyback plan for purchase and retirement of common shares is 3.5 million over the next seven quarters. To clarify, the company does not hold any treasury stock, meaning the purpose of the buyback plan is to purchase shares in the open market and subsequently retire them from issuance, hence reducing the number of common shares outstanding.', 'Moving forward, as cash generation increases, the Board will strategically review its capital allocation strategy to evaluate the best use of capital between strengthening the balance sheet, buying back common shares, and/or retiring the preferred stock.', 'I want to point out that the total amount of actual common shares outstanding as of June 30, 2019 was 19,793,000 shares. This is down sequentially from 19,871,000 common shares at March 31, 2019. The decrease reflects shares purchased under the buyback net of those shares issued during the period.', 'Due to the mathematical calculation of weighted average shares for EPS purposes and not the actual number of shares, readers of the financial statement should recognize there is a delay for actual shares and weighted average shares to converge.', 'On a final note on cash and cash flow generation. We generated $3.7 million an additional cash during fiscal 2019 and as a result we now have over $18.6 million in total cash, net of the stock buyback. Remember, balance sheet strength is important to our customers, therefore we expect to continue to grow our cash balances through recurring revenue, a well-controlled cost structure, maximizing profitability and generating value for our customers and shareholders.', 'I will now pass the call over to Randy.', 'Randy Fields', 'Thanks John.', \"The transitioning of the finance team under John’s leadership has been smooth and I’m excited to have him with us again, so a little bit about the year-end review. In fiscal 2019 our strategic priorities were to expand our recurring earning power, increase our cash flow from operations and continue to improve our margins. We accomplished all three and ended the year with our strongest balance sheet, doubled our previous highest cash flow year and deliver the best margins in our company's history.\", 'We did this by the way, while making significant investments in marketplace and temporarily sacrificing our top line growth by reducing non-recurring revenue by $2 million. With that, we have once again strengthened our platform to better scale the company for the significant growth that we see ahead of us.', 'During the year we made significant operational progress in each of the three revenue streams. We grow over 13% increase in the size of our total network to more than 340,000 total connections position us for even more growth in the future. Our compliance network incidentally increased by more than 40% to nearly 90,000 facility level connections. For reference sake, remember just a few years ago we had 200.', 'It’s important to keep in mind that the real mission of the business is to scale the network until we touch and connect everyone in the supply chain of U.S. food and then replicate that model broad. As you know, the economic value of each connection varies as a function of the service offered.', \"Over the course of the last few years, we've doubled the size of the network in the company's revenue as a result, this may also actually help you understand why the financial results in any given quarter vary, frankly depending on what type of connections we focused on in that particular quarter.\", 'Over the next few years as we continue to drive the scale of our network from where we are today, we can see our way quite quickly to 500,000 total connections and then on doing 1 million. The growth in the scale of our network is obviously been the driver of our profitability and has generated the cash flow that we needed to build out the full platform.', 'Our build out is deliberately sequential and we focus on one of the three applications at a time, so as to reduce the risk of customer confusion and dependency on outside capital and its inevitable dilution.', 'We’re financing each stage of the platform build out with cash generated from the previous components, even when building this out, we’re one of the most profitable companies of our size in the entire public universe, we’re very proud of that fact.', \"This year we've been preparing to drive the scope of what we do across our network with a priority and focus on recurring revenue opportunities. We've reduced our non-recurring revenues by 25% from our prior year and we're hopeful that over the next couple of years our core business recurring revenue will grow to about 80% of total on much higher revenue and up from the mid-60s two years ago and 70% last year.\", \"The strategy frankly is simple, reduce non-recurring revenues in dollars, at the same time we accelerate the growth of recurring revenue. This transition though is not without a bit of pain but it's important for us to maximize predictable profitability of the business going forward is nearly impossible mathematically to overcome non-recurring revenue reductions over the very short-term, we understand that well, we've done it before.\", \"If marketplace is successful, it will tend to drive our non-recurring revenue up to the large seasonal orders, that's why it's important that our current SaaS revenue, the recurring is much as possible and as quickly as we can.\", 'This is also why we have lower revenues in the quarter and the year. The math is simple, just to overcome the 2 million in non-recurring revenue, we would need $7 million to $8 million of new contracted recurring revenue, added in a single year and on the first day of that fiscal year, not easy to say at least.', \"I'd like to review the marketing changes and the progress we've made over the past few months with our Tier 2 initiative. Obviously, I am going to talk about compliance and where our current focus is and the focus is on what we call Tier 2 HUBs. First it’s important to note that we believe there are 500,000 to a 1 million possible entities worldwide in the global food supply chain and therefore millions of possible connections.\", \"As we said from the beginning of our compliance management initiative, our goal is to connect them all. To do that, we must dive deeper and deeper into the supply chain from retailers and their suppliers where we've been to this point to suppliers of the suppliers and then on to the suppliers of the suppliers and so on and so forth.\", \"Last year we laid the groundwork for this initiative. We've hired key people, including the former CEO of another player in the space to drive our effort. The wins have been accelerating dramatically. In fact, that began in the last quarter of 2019. We never lack for ambition, and our ambition this year is to add 300% more Tier 2 HUBs that we started the year with. The growth of the Tier 2 HUBs even at this astounding rate will not be a huge revenue producer this year because of our subscription accounting is done, but if we’re successful, we will add nearly 15,000 more customers to our network of over 23,000 customers.\", 'Keep in mind, every new customer becomes an upsell candidate. The opportunity is a mess. The task of signing them all up is daunting, but we want them all. The immensity of the size of this pyramid is one that we intend to approach and approach it very successfully.', \"Interestingly, our targets are now exclusively our existing customers, our current customers. I don't have to tell you what this means in terms of our long-term ability to upgrade them. Overwhelmingly, they love us, seriously. They really appreciate what we do for them. So now we are focused on marketing and sales to the current customer base, tens of thousands of suppliers and the goal is to almost double the number of suppliers, not connections, in our pond as we call it over the next couple of years.\", \"Doubling the size of the pond, means that, at a constant win rate, you double the new revenue from Tier 2 customers on each round. We have strategically structured and revised our pricing model to be very, very low to simplify the sales process and shorten the sales cycle. We need lots of them to build the large stream of recurring revenue but we’re gaining traction and I'm very confident we’re on the right track. I expect to add as many new HUBs this quarter as we did all of last year, it's working.\", \"Okay, on the marketplace. As we’ve said before, marketplace is potentially the most significant product launch in the company's history. It is that, because of its ability to increase the scope of our engagement revenue per customer, across the scale of our network with very little additional touch.\", 'Our first use case of marketplace is sourcing products for retailers in non-core categories. It was conceived and was executed by one of our largest customers. Not only worked, the customer loves it and continues to use it. We’re close we believe to adding a second customer for this use case, fingers crossed, no guarantees.', \"Our second use case is sourcing products for retailers when an existing supplier runs out of that product. An example of that success from visibility is a customer began with one small emergency order last year our success led to acting is a source for the entire buy for that product this year and now we're working with the wholesaler to that retailer, sourcing the same product, brilliant execution almost always wins.\", \"Earlier this year we launched what we believe is the most important use case, what we call Similar Supplier. Similar Supplier enables retailer and wholesaler to use marketplace to search for replacement vendors from our entire database of compliant suppliers. In the last eight months we've gone from a few hundred to nearly 28,000 category participants, huge, huge effort on our part and now the industry is beginning to see the value in the database. They are taking note. Ultimately, remember, we are a company whose intrinsic value is the scale of its network and the ability to monetize its data.\", \"On the supply chain. In supply chain, we continue to see industry dynamics driving higher interest in our applications, specifically for our Scan Based trading and our out-of-stock management. We believe, in fact, that supply chain could be our standout performer in fiscal 2020. As online competitors like Amazon expand home delivery, out-of-stocks have taken on a critical importance for food retailers, not just for their lost sales, but more importantly, by virtue of the fact that their customer loyalty is eroded when they don't have a product on the shelf.\", \"ReposiTrak's Scan Based trading gives suppliers visibility to point-of-sale transactions, so they can replenish store inventory more accurately, reducing out-of-stocks and frankly returns. Up until this point, only large grocers have had visibility in out-of-stocks and the ability to do Scan Based trading. Even they frankly didn't do it very well.\", \"Our effectiveness of reducing out-of-stocks exceeds even Randy's expectations. We’re seeing 80% of the suppliers reducing out-of-stock significantly and less than their first month of use. This is a potential game changer. This will expand our footprint substantially within our existing customers.\", 'Historically, we focused on larger retailers for our supply chain work. Now we are empowering smaller retailers with the same Scan Based trading tool as the big guys, so they can be more competitive in going after grocery dollars.', 'Recently, as you probably saw, we signed a partnership with Associated Wholesale Grocers. AWG is the largest cooperative food wholesaler to independently own supermarkets and has 3,800 stores in its network. Over the next few years, the AWG collaboration could well become our largest single supply chain account.', 'And by the way, it was a great cross-selling win. Remember, we began with them with our Compliance Management capabilities. So let me summarize. We are unique in our ability to help buyers source that and transact efficiently with a new supplier. We have a moat around our business that let’s to build out the scale and the scope of our network of buyers and suppliers in a strategic and underlying, underscore, deliberate manner that let us maximize each component while generating exceptional profits and cash flow.', 'Now, from my perspective to judge our progress in 2020, I would have you look at the following; first, we will execute on our Tier 2 initiative. In fiscal 2020, we have a goal to increase the number of Tier 2 HUBs using ReposiTrak by 300% or nearly 200 additional Tier 2 HUBs.', 'Second, as fiscal 2020 develops, much of our emphasis will be on expanding our footprint with our current customers. 70% of our recurring revenue growth this year, we believe will come from our existing customers, which is obviously, testimony to the importance of our devotion to our customer success.', \"It's important to note that our company could double in size over the next few years by expanding our existing customer’s use of the same services they currently have. We will focus on doing just that. We will be building on our maniacal devotion to our customers. It is paying off.\", \"Third, we will introduce new monetization models for the marketplace. By the end of 2020, we will have evaluated various monetization models. And we'll have a clear path forward for how we generate profitable revenue underscore profitable revenue from all of the use cases we support. As an example, we've just introduced ReposiTrak certified a program that should help suppliers stand out with their retail customers.\", 'Fourth, we will shortly conclude our first major win in the U.K. and this will be the year in which we establish our presence there to a much greater degree. We will have an announcement we hope about that before too long. And finally, we will be growing our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue. But we will continue to grow our bottom line in cash generation capabilities.', 'As we said in fiscal 2019, the percent of recurring revenues increased to 70% up from the mid-60s two years ago. But our goal is to get it into the 80s. This profitability is strengthening our balance sheet, which is a critical concern for our customers and enabling us to continue to buy back shares without additional borrowing or impairing our growing cash balance.', \"Very soon we'll be in a place where our need to increase the cash balance will diminish. So through the strategic and deliberate execution of our strategy, we’ll expand both the scale and the scope of our network of customers, re-accelerate revenue growth this year, all the while generating growing profitability, cash flow and cash.\", \"And in turn, we believe this will enhance shareholder value. To be clear, while we are acutely focused on our earning power and cash generation, we expect fiscal 2020 will once again be a year of top line growth. So, with that, let's open the call to questions. Operator?\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Thomas Forte, D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.', 'Thomas Forte', \"Great, so two questions. First off, who do you see today as your primary competition for your three main offerings? And how does that change, if at all, during the last fiscal year? And then second, when we think about your marketplace efforts and we think about your ability, we're talking about potentially adding a second customer for the use case on purchasing the products that aren't in your existing supply chain, so to speak how should we think about your -- I guess go-to-market strategy for marketplace for additional use cases beyond that customer?\", 'Randy Fields', 'Okay, so Tom thank you. I think the first question was, in general, who do we see as competitors? Does that – did I get that right?', 'Thomas Forte', 'And has that changed over the last fiscal year, Randy?', 'Randy Fields', \"It actually hasn't. Our primary, we have two primary competitors. The first is what we call roll your own, meaning a retailer largely because the CIO tells the CEO, he will say, oh, I can do this. We don't need anybody. That's our primary competitor what we call a roll your own strategy. And the other is in action, meaning a retailer could reasonably say to us, “you know, I've got a bunch of issues I'm dealing with, I'm fighting some fires. I like what you're doing. I can't do it now.”\", \"So, to a certain extent, our problem is one of getting people to pay attention today to a problem that we can resolve. The row your own thing we've dealt with over many years, and it tends to go away meaning because we are a specialist at what we do.\", \"And because we handle the support because we handle the programming, et cetera, there are no retailers that want to run a help desk for their vendors, for example. So ultimately, we've had the experience where very large retailers who at one point did what we do in their minds turned it back over to us. So really, in a sense you could say our competitor is our potential customer.\", \"Okay, second question on the use case. Again, I want to say that it's speculative to assume that we will get this second user, but the second user is going to use us as a platform, and interestingly will bring its own vendors to the platform and it will be, if you will, a private label use of our technology much it in a similar sense to our largest customer who's doing this, but they would be paying, in fact a recurring annual fee if they proceed with us.\", \"So that's same technology, different way of charging slightly different use case. Again, we think that has pretty interesting opportunities beyond the one that we're looking at. To say a little bit more about marketplace, I continue to feel better and better about it. We're looking at a pipeline that is pretty extraordinary. I'm skeptical is, as you know, about this particular area of work for us. So, I can't imagine that all this pipeline materializes.\", 'And my goal is that by the end of the year, we will have sorted this out and either marketplace will drop out of the platform and just become an add-on to our compliance management capability, where it is sorely needed or it will become the standalone product that all of us think that it could be.', \"So -- but I'm feeling more, it feels more likely that it's that case, the optimistic case than the pessimistic case. Something we shouldn't overlook and maybe my comments didn't say it strongly enough. There's an extraordinarily high level of interest in our supply chain activity. We will see strong growth rates in annual recurring revenue in net domain this year. We think the surprise, the surprise growth this year will be coming from supply chain. The interest is extraordinary. Any other question Tom? \", 'Thomas Forte', 'If I may one quick, one quick follow-on question. So, when you talk about your next customer will be an existing customer adding another service, is that also in reference to marketplace or is that in reference to your other services?', 'Randy Fields', \"Both, let me want to. And again, I apologize because sometimes I use a lot of words, and it doesn't make it clearer. We have a huge opportunity with our existing customers with existing products, meaning we're not, we don't occupy 100% of the TAM with each customer for the product that they've bought. Some have 300%, 400%, or 500% growth potentials in revenue, with a full penetration.\", \"At the same time, we have opportunities for cross selling the customers to other product areas. I mentioned in the case of AWG, they started out as a compliance customer, and honestly it builds confidence. They knew that we are a company that takes care of its customers that if it says it's going to perform, it does perform.\", \"So that gave us a leg up when we went to them with our supply chain activity. So, in other words, we believe the missing ingredient in the universe of technology vendors is technology vendors that you can trust. Five years ago, don't hold me to the exact number this company had around 600 named customers, 600. Today, we have 23,000 named customers.\", 'I suggest that if our Tier-2 initiative is successful, and certainly we believe it will be, it will be somewhere mid-30s, 30,000 or 40,000 named customers, wow! Each one of those, if we continue with our maniacal devotion to taking care of them, which we do, not only does our loss rate stay at absurdly low levels, but our ability to upsell and cross sell gets better and better.', 'So we feel very good about the cross selling opportunities, and the expansion opportunities of the same product to our existing customers, both of those.', 'Operator', 'We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I will now turn the call back over to Randy Fields for closing remarks.', 'Randy Fields', \"Okay, thank you. Appreciate you all taking the time to hear about our quarter in the year. And we are as optimistic as we've ever been about our prospects. Again, our focus obviously is going to be on the recurring revenue. And I think all of us will be very pleased with how this year turns out. So thanks for taking the time. Bye-bye.\", 'Operator', \"This concludes today's conference.

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Looking at the third quarter, consolidated net revenue was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solution revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Networking continued to perform well, driven by strong demand for our merchant switching and routing platforms, and as we also expected, shipments of custom silicon solutions in AI, SmartNIC, and video transcoding to cloud datacenters were strong.', 'Wireless is of course seeing the beginning of a typical seasonal uptick and initial positive effects of increased content. These tailwinds were partially offset by weaker demand in storage and broadband. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.1 billion. The CA business is running above our expectations, benefiting from sustained enterprise demand for our mainframe and distributed software. However, SAN switching demand has paused as our partner OEM supply chain compressed in these uncertain conditions.', 'Now, let me address the current environment and outlook. Enterprise and mainframe software customer demand continues to remain stable, particularly in North America and Western Europe. SAN switching demand will likely continue to be down another quarter, while inventory in the OEM channels are being worked down.', 'As it relates to semiconductors, although the US-China trade conflict continues, we have not seen further deterioration in our business, both specific to China as well as globally. Accordingly, we continue to expect to achieve over $22.5 billion of revenue in fiscal 2019, including $17.5 billion from semiconductor solutions and $5 billion from infrastructure software.', 'Looking to next year. Infrastructure software is stable as renewals among our core customer base continue to be very solid. However, visibility continues to be very limited on the semiconductor side. So, we are managing the business with an expectation that we will continue to operate in a very low growth uncertain macro environment for the foreseeable future.', 'Fortunately, the fundamentals of our semiconductor business remains strong. As you know, our business is all about connectivity from CPUs to memory in data centers, core to edge in networks, central office to client devices in distributed systems, and here we continue to benefit from the underlying trend in the IT world, and insatiable need for increasing bandwidth to connect things.', \"In data centers, Tomahawk switching have gone from 3.2 terabits per second just three years ago to 12.8 terabit per second today. In cloud computing, as the limits to Moore's Law constrained CPU and GPU performance, the pipes linking computing cycles to the network and storage expense. PCI Express Gen 4 today at 16G replaces Gen 3 with the likes of next generation Rome CPU. Legacy network interface controllers, NICs as they say are becoming really intelligent, and what we now call SmartNICs and takes on the task of accelerating workloads offload from non-optimized CPU within cloud computing.\", 'Even in SAN, that’s storage area network, fibre channel progresses its bandwidth at 32 gigabit per second in Generation 6 today to Generation 7 at 64 gigabit per second next year to reap the full benefit of all flash arrays in enterprise storage. And to truly connect computer storage replacing direct attach copper, fiber optics running in 100 gig -- 100 G channels are moving to 400 G as our hypercloud customers scale out data centers with Tomahawk 3 today.', 'Turning to telco networks. Call routing has gone from 1.6 terabit per second a few years ago to 9.6 terabits as represented by our Jericho 2 router today. In broadband, cable modem with DOCSIS 3.0 at 1 gigabit today will move to DOCSIS 4.0 at 10 gigabit over the next few years as cable operators need to compete against 5G networks.', \"So it is with DSL, digital subscriber line, we're at a mere 500 megabit per second of data flow today, you will upshift to over 1 gigabit per second in G.Fast, which may seem inadequate, so we need GPON at 2.5 gigabit, and even with that we are poised today to launch into mass markets with 10G xPON. Of course, wireless connectivity too has seen the most headline.\", 'And in enterprise access gateways, the protocol has moved from 802.11ac to the new OFDMA enable 802.11ax, otherwise called Wi-Fi 6, and we are at the cusp of cellular communication migrating from 4G to next generation 5G in radio access networks and smartphones. We are enabling these fundamental trends in the marketplace. This gives us confidence that we will continue to sustain and grow our semiconductor business over the long term.', \"Moving on, let's talk about software, first the CA. As we mentioned, our model for CA is to focus on the 500 largest enterprises in the world, the biggest users of our infrastructure software. Based on experience through fiscal third quarter 2019, we expect our core customer business, that's up for renewal in fiscal year 2019 to grow over 20%. Meanwhile, the attrition rate of business from the long tail of customers behind this core group is anticipated to be over 10% for fiscal 2019.\", \"We have another two plus years to turn over the CA customer contract, but But based on the trends of renewal growth from these core customer base in excess of the attrition of non-core business over the last nine months, we're confident that we can meet if not exceed the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for CA to you last year when we acquired that business. Our integration activity is largely complete with operating expenses to support CA approaching target levels.\", \"Finally, let me take a few more minutes to talk about our planned acquisition of the Symantec Enterprise business announced in August. Acquiring Symantec furthers our efforts to build one of world's leading infrastructure technology platforms. It allow -- it is the logical next step in Broadcom's infrastructure software strategy, and adds $160 billion cybersecurity market to our -- to the Broadcom's addressable TAM.\", 'We will gain a portfolio of mission-critical security solutions that are deeply embedded among our core customers. There will be meaningful cross-selling opportunities with Brocade and CA solutions, and we believe this acquisition will enable Broadcom to gain a larger share of the wallet of this core customers and we expect this transaction to add more than $2 billion of sustainable run rate revenue with this leading franchises in cyber security and we also expect to achieve in excess of $1 billion in run rate cost synergies within 12 months post close.', 'And importantly, this transaction gives us the opportunity to achieve -- our ongoing financial objective of double-digit cash on cash returns. The integration planning process is well underway, and as you likely saw, we cleared HSR last week. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 subject to antitrust approvals in the European Union and Japan, as well as of course customary closing conditions.', 'To sum, a broad and increasingly diversified portfolio of leadership, technology franchises has allowed us today to sustain revenue and increase cash flows even in this challenging market environment.', 'Now let me turn this call over to Tom.', 'Thomas Krause', 'Thank you, Hock. Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $5.5 billion, a 9% increase from a year ago. The Semiconductor Solutions segment revenue was $4.4 billion and represented 79% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 5% year-on-year on a comparable basis. Our Infrastructure Software segment revenue was $1.1 billion and represented 21% of revenue. Free cash flow was 42% of revenue or $2.31 billion and grew 8.5% year-over-year.', 'Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.01 billion, driven by further reductions from CA-related activities. Operating income from continuing operations was $2.91 billion and represented 52.8% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.06 billion and represented 55.6% of net revenue. This figure excludes $141 million of depreciation.', 'In terms of working capital, our payables increase of $237 million was somewhat offset by receivables increase of $55 million, and an inventory increase of $57 million from the prior quarter. I would also note that we accrued $110 million of restructuring and integration expenses, and made $164 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter. Finally, we spent $112 million on capital expenditures.', 'In the third quarter, we returned $2 billion to stockholders, consisting of $1.1 billion in the form of cash dividends and $977 million for the repurchase and elimination of 3.5 million AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash, $37.6 billion of total debt, 398 million outstanding shares and had 442 million fully diluted shares for the quarter.', 'Turning to our fiscal year 2019 guidance. As Hock discussed, we are maintaining our full-year revenue guidance of $22.5 billion, including approximately $17.5 billion from Semiconductor Solutions and approximately $5 billion from Infrastructure Software. IP licensing is not expected to generate a material amount of revenue.', 'On a non-GAAP basis, operating margins are expected to be approximately 52.5%. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. The tax rate is forecasted to be approximately 11%. Depreciation is expected to be approximately $600 million. CapEx is expected to be approximately $500 million. As a result, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $9 billion, which does take into account projected restructuring and integration charges of approximately $1.1 billion.', 'Note, as of the end of the third quarter, $6.9 billion of free cash flow has been generated and includes $969 million of restructuring and integration charges. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and finally, we expect average diluted share count to be 440 million for Q4 and this excludes any impact from share buybacks and eliminations.', 'Now on the capital allocation. As many of you know, Broadcom has a business model that generates a very healthy amount of free cash flow across an increasingly diverse and stable set of mainly infrastructure technology franchises. Over the last few years, we have worked to create a more transparent and balanced capital allocation policy.', 'First and foremost, we have committed to return half of our free cash flow to shareholders each year in the form of cash dividends. In essence, this allows the AVGO stockholder decide how best to reinvest 50% of the free cash flow that we generate.', 'In return, we have, in effect as the Broadcom struggle to put trust and management to optimally reinvest the remainder of the free cash flow after the dividend is distributed. Fundamentally, we think that we have a unique M&A strategy that allows us to consistently reinvest these excess cash flows that will drive returns well above our free cash flow yields.', 'Over the past few years, we have developed a road map primarily around Infrastructure Software starting with Brocade, and then with CA and now Symantec that will allow us to continue to execute on the strategy for many years to come. So going forward, our plan is to use this excess cash for acquisitions and/or to pay down debt that we borrowed to make these acquisitions.', \"Now over the last years, we have bought back a lot of stock. We had an opportunity to buy stock at depressed prices following the CA announcement. We also want to limit the dilution from the one-time multi-year grant we did earlier this year. In all, we have invested $13.1 billion to repurchase or eliminate a total of 54.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $240 per share over the last 16 months through the end of our fiscal Q3 '19.\", 'So in summary, we think this decision made a lot of sense. That being said, maintaining our core capital allocation strategy of dividends and M&A while pursuing meaningful buybacks in parallel has caused us to increase our leverage and leverage multiples pretty substantially.', \"Especially in light of the weak macro environment we are seeing today, we're conscious of the risks that a more levered balance sheet creates and are very focused on managing those risks. As a result, we have started to transition our focus to deleveraging the balance sheet following the recent Symantec acquisition announcement.\", \"That concludes my prepared remarks. During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit yourselves to one question each, so we're going to accommodate as many analysts as possible. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.', 'Harlan Sur', 'Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Good to see the business bottoming here in the second half of the year. Hock, you know we continue to hear that Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2 are seeing strong demand for the 200 gig and 400 gig cloud networking adoption, also your revenue and design win pipeline on compute networking and security off-load acceleration ASICs is pretty strong with guys like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etcetera.', 'Last earnings call, you had anticipated full year double-digits growth in your datacenter networking, compute off-load businesses. Question is, are you still tracking to that and despite the muted growth outlook for the overall business looking into next year, given your design win pipeline, do you expect continued double-digits growth in the datacenter networking and compute off-load looking into next year as well?', 'Hock Tan', \"I guess, the bottom line answer is, our outlook, which we shared with you much early on has not changed materially at all. Yes, we do see continuing improve -- ramp of ship deliveries into hypercloud gains [ph] on those various networking as well as computing off-load silicon, and that hasn't changed and that has in fact given quite a lot of buffer to otherwise been a fairly uncertain and difficult markets at this point.\", 'Harlan Sur', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Vivek Arya', \"Thanks for taking my question. Hock, you started mentioning something about next year and I just wanted to flesh that out. I know you're not giving next year guidance per se, but on the positive side, you're saying business is bottoming, you outlined the number of product cycles or so, but then you sound a little bit cautious on just the environment.\", 'So, I was curious how you were thinking conceptually about next year, pluses and minuses. And then as part of that, if you could also give us some indication of how Huawei figures into that both kind of in the near-term Q4 and next year? Thank you.', 'Hock Tan', \"Well, you actually answered my question for me in many ways, which is you're -- you implying -- which is correct that the US-China trade dispute is turning into an extended affair with lots of twists and turns and uncertainty. And we are assuming things on conditions, environment is not going to change from what we're seeing now. And if we make that assumption next year, you probably see a very uncertain 2020.\", \"But as we sit here right now and we probably have another three -- at least another three months before, we probably give you a much more clear 2020 guidance, but as we sit here right now over the rest of this calendar year, if not fiscal year, what we're seeing is, you're right, which appears -- it appears we have hit bottom at least in the semiconductor -- as it relates to the semiconductor solutions side, we have hit bottom and we are kind of looking ahead and saying that we're paying right here more or less with little seasonality that pops up every now and then as we’re seeing to some extent probably in the next few months as we see ramp up of our North American -- large North American OEM customer in handsets. But other than that, broadly, we're kind of staying at the bottom.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.', 'John Pitzer', \"Yeah, good afternoon guys. Well, thanks for letting me ask question. Hock, I realize that you're trying to stay away from giving too specific guidance by business line, but I'm just kind of curious relative to your comment on the wireless side of the Semi business, how should we think about this build cycle for you this year prior -- relative to past years when -- there is a view that you're gaining content on the RF side, you've got Wi-Fi 6.\", \"Your largest customer is also not staggering their phone launch this year. They've got some tariff issues that they might want to pull in some builds, so I just -- as you look at the results for the July quarter, were they up sequentially kind of in that mid-teens level, how do we think about October and how long is this build and what's the seasonal look into January? So if you could give us any sort of color that would be helpful.\", 'Hock Tan', \"Well, it's always in this kind of -- even in this kind of program, we have limited visibility as provided by our customers how far we can go. And to be very specific about what we are asking in wireless, as -- as we’ve always done in previous years, we see beginning of uptick seasonality in Q3, which is the July quarter, and we'll see more of it in our last quarter of the fiscal year, which is October quarter, and we fully expect to see that.\", 'And frankly that’s as far as we see in this typical kind of outlook, because it obviously depends at the end of the day on reset of our OEM customers. But we do see that this year, we do not see any major departure from that; and you know year-on-year, things are quite predictable in this respect.', 'But having said that, as you know, we are a Company much more than just wireless today. In our -- even in our Semiconductor Solutions, we have broad areas where we participate in and there are multiple puts and takes as I kind of indicated in terms of what happened in Q3 and while we see continuing strength in networking, computing offload in the data centers, we do see some weaknesses in storage and broadband, and it will probably -- things might probably look better next quarter for wireless, but maybe there are some other areas of mitigate and that will go the opposite way.', \"But broadly, given our large portfolio and broad diversity and the fact that we are very fundamentally strong in each of those areas we are in, which we are saying -- what we are seeing and what we're saying here is that in the semiconductor macro market, which is where they are pretty well represented on average, we are not as strong as it was same time last year.\", \"And if you look at our data so far this year-to-date, we're down probably on average of about 8% year-on-year or thereabouts, which is in my view, what we are seeing -- what the market -- what we think the market is on a broad basis excluding memory of course. And the fact that we were year-on-year down more in Q1, Q2 this fiscal year and probably less down in the back half of fiscal '19 should not be taken as a fact that that’s the bottom and there is possibly a recovery.\", \"That's why we made the statement. We know we are pretty confident we are at the bottom. The question is, there is not much clarity or visibility yet or certainty that any sharp recovery is around the corner.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.', 'Chris Danely', 'Hey, thanks guys. Hey Hock, can you talk about the expected timing of the 5G ramp, especially for your ASIC and ASSP business. When you think that starts? Is this has been pushed out at all? Is it about as good as you thought it would be three or six months ago or has the forecast changed and how much?', 'Hock Tan', \"Well, that's a tough question in terms of that, because to be honest with you, you know we do not participate that much on 5G ramp on radio access in a broad perspective. We thought -- we thought at the handset level, we touched someone at the radio access, but we believe we probably touched most at the backhaul, the networks. And I think each of them ramps -- will ramp 5G at different times.\", \"So our -- in our perception -- in our ability to see what -- how big that ramp is at any particular point in time, it's also dependent on the fact that -- the fact that different operators in different countries were probably want to ramp up at different points in time, different parts of the network, whether it's a front side ramp or the backhaul. And my guess is probably, you won't see much of it until later this year, early part of next year. As far as we are concerned, which is more of the backhaul where it affects our numbers.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.', 'Stacy Rasgon', \"Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to know, you've had a growth target for semi's of mid-single digits, and obviously we're in an uncertain environment. But you also talked a lot about, I guess, company specific drivers and product cycles that fundamentally can still drive.\", \"So I guess, are those fundamental drivers are enough to keep the semi business growing at least somewhere in the ballpark of that sort of mid-single digit long-term guidance even in an environment that's uncertainty. I guess, maybe even put a different way, could you maybe talk about specifically some of the product cycles and trajectories that are may be unique to Broadcom that you see kind of ramping next year and maybe compare with what we had this year across your different businesses?\", 'Hock Tan', \"Well, yeah, when I went on this quantification of the various trends driving the fundamentals of our product lines and our semiconductor business, I really wasn't thinking necessarily and if I give the wrong impression, I do apologize, one year. This is our ongoing trend. And I was using examples, because these are examples ongoing that we see today, recent past and going forward in the future.\", \"But what I do see is that, yeah, then all this areas we participate in from -- as networking in data centers, routing in core and metro networks, in cable and broadband where we all are -- one thing is clear, which is the nice thing we see in technology, especially the semiconductor technology, there is a constant evolution of the products we do, that's constant demand for improved performance or if I put it increased bandwidth, in essence, we do connectivity.\", \"And depending on a -- in a particular applications, some may spend a year, some may spend three years to make a transition, but they do happen and they continue to happen and that one keeps demand sustain for our technology, for our products, and that's what underpins as reported a long-term growth forecast in semiconductors for us of mid-single digits. And I don't mean a year, I don't mean necessary even two or three years, I mean over the next five years, 10 years, because think about it right.\", \"In 2018 fiscal, our semiconductor business organically, take out all acquisitions, grew 12% year-on-year from '17. And in '17, we grew another -- over 16%, about 10% organically. So I frankly do not expect that high rate to double-digit rate in this business where we have pretty well represented across a broad area to be able to continue at that rate of growth. And so we see in '19, a decline from a -- from a strong '18 as I said, probably mid to high-single digits. Not unexpected and -- but taken over a period of multiple years, we believe we have -- we will achieve that mid single-digit compounded annual growth rate but I won't do that every year. Thank you.\", 'Operator', 'Thanks. Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.', 'Ross Seymore', \"Thanks. Tom, I had one for you on the capital return side of things. In the past, that 50% dividend policy you have, it's very clear, but the free cash flow that generates that at times has been a little more subjective due to one-time charges finishing the classic Broadcom campus, etc. So how does restructuring charges, how do they fit into the math of free cash flow. And then the investment grade target where you want to keep it there, what sort of leverage target should we think about with you guys more aggressively paying down debt as opposed to repurchasing shares in the near future?\", 'Thomas Krause', \"Yeah, I think on the cash flow side, Ross, what we've tried to do is create somewhat of a formula, because we do typically have acquisitions and we do have investments we make to get to the synergy targets. And in fact what we're trying to do is deliver the benefits to the stockholders the year with which we are able to achieve those synergies. So what we've done, as we said, look, what would it be free cash flow from operations, which obviously includes was restructuring charges and what's add back those for the purposes of calculating the dividend.\", \"So when we get to the end of the year, we will take the cash flow from operations, we will add back the restructuring, integration charges and in fact will divide by 2 to get to the number that we use to calculate the dividend. This year we don't have any specific one-time large campus initiatives of things like that that we would also want to back out. So that should be a fairly good proxy for how we think about the dividend and the recommendation of the Board at the end of this year.\", \"In terms of investment grade, I think we've talked about this before, but maintaining investment grade similar to the dividend policy is a core principle here, and I think the reason for that, Mark and I discussed it many times internally is, it provides maximum flexibility for us to continue to pursue our strategy. It's always been very important. And so over time, we had this one-time event.\", \"We bought back a bunch of stock as I talked about in the prepared remarks, that's pushed leverage up more so than we normally would. We think based on the economics and the results so far that was the right decision, but we're really looking forward to going back to the playbook we pursued in the past which is following the distribution of the dividend.\", \"Now we still have a lot of cash flow and that cash flow we think based on our strategy is best use for M&A because that's where the returns are most optimal. But as part of that, we often borrow money to finance those acquisitions, and then we go and pay that debt down. So I think we're going back to a more traditional playbook and as part of that given the size and the scale and the increasing diversity of the business and the share profitability and the cash flows, we're very much an investment grade company and we're going to be very focused on maintaining that investment grade status going forward.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Blayne Curtis', 'Hey guys, thanks for your question. Tom for you, just on the annual guidance for OP margin would suggest a tick down into October, I just want to make sure how literally to take that, and if so, can you talk about any drivers as to why profitability to be coming down in October? Thanks.', 'Thomas Krause', \"Yeah, it's a good point, and maybe we're a bit conservative to be honest, when I think the reality as you see the mix shift in the second half of the year. We've got a couple things going on. One with wireless ramping seasonally as Hock discussed, those margins are not as high as the rest of the portfolio. And then on top of that, we are giving back some on the SAN switching side in the back half which is fairly high margin product. So we thought it made sense given the mix to stick to that number and that's why we're staying there.\", 'Blayne Curtis', 'Got you. Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Toshiya Hari', \"Yeah, hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the question. Hock, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the hyperscale cloud environment. A couple of your peers are -- quite a few of your peers have talked about signs of recovery into the back half and potentially into 2020 following a pretty extended period of weakness. I appreciate you guys have drivers that are very specific to the Company. But in terms of customer sentiment on spending and capacity expansion, what are your thoughts there? Thank you.\", 'Hock Tan', \"Okay. Well, it's a very interesting question. And I guess I put it two ways. One is touching on cloud spending. We pretty much see some of what a lot of people out there are saying in common lately, which is an improvement in cloud spending in multiple areas, especially in scaling out new generation datacenters as they expand their business. We obviously benefit from that in our switching, routing in some of our specific custom off-load programs in AI or just SmartNIC. So -- and we see that, but as we all know these days, cloud spending is starting to be a bit like telco spending very lumpy.\", \"What we see on the other half of our business in infrastructure is we've enterprises, end users, and here from the viewpoint of an opportunity to see end users directly and we see end use -- enterprises or end users who are the end users, especially the largest bunch of our core customers, their spending continues.\", \"Their IT budget is pretty strong and they're spending continues because they need that digital transformation as their business continues fairly decently and that hasn't impacted, which is why our infrastructure software business, renewals continue to grow very nicely. And that's not an issue. It's when we sell components to OEMs, who then make it into systems to sell to these same end users, then we see a difference.\", \"And the difference is simply that, I think given as far as we could gather -- given uncertainty in this environment that everybody is constraining -- all our partners are constraining their supply chain and compressing the supply chain, so to speak, and then action of compressing is really a reduction in orders, a reduction in what appears to be demand. So it's really interesting as we see it.\", \"That on our software side, things are direct sales to large enterprises continue fairly unabated. But when it comes to selling components through partners to the same end users, we're seeing a different perspective, slowdown, a constrain, and it's reflected obviously in the numbers we are showing here. And it also is reflected in the outlook that we are giving to you guys.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Craig Hettenbach', 'Yes, thank you. Hock, switching gears to CA in the software side. Can you talk about just some of the efforts around portfolio license agreements, specifically what kind of sales efforts you have in place there and what this could mean for the business over the next couple of years as you try to gear it that way?', 'Hock Tan', \"Yes. Well, it is in the portfolio licensing arrangements as soon as a sales model or business model we apply to our infrastructure software business, which is CA at this point. In my mind, and to be fair, it's less than a year since we launch it, but I -- we since we took over CA only the last November has been I would call it very successful. It has been very encouraging and a big part of why we think it is encouraging the way it works is, because we just focus on the largest 500, 600 customers of CA.\", 'These are guidance where we have large decent signs for large footprints to begin with, and as we go towards renewals, with our ability to offer a portfolio-wide licensing arrangement, a limited capacity on the full range of products -- broad products that we have that extend beyond -- from mainframe to distributed software is extremely attractive and cost effective to those large enterprises who buys a lot of those Infrastructure Software. So we have done multiple deals as rental multiple renewals and we continue to be very engaged with those companies.', \"So I guess my conclusion is by focusing on these largest customers we've large -- where we have large footprint that exists and where they ability to consume more of those software we have is mix a lot of sense. And as I put in some of my comments earlier on and this -- and this ability to focus on these largest guys and put the sales motion technically and commercially very effectively on this large customers and possibly not focus on the long tail of non-core customers is a key part of the whole model and what makes the whole model works simply because conceptually we are reviewing those contracts with larger footprints on portfolio licensing agreements as I mentioned at a rate of over 20% annually.\", \"While we are probably because of lack of focus, reducing or attriting smaller non-core customers at 10% and those core customers represent 80% of our overall revenue where the long tail represent only 20%, ends up in a situation after one year -- almost one-year where we show a net gain of over 10%. Keep that going, three years later, we reached the average term of every contract we put in place. We would see a clear step up in our revenues from this business of -- we'd like to believe double-digit growth.\", 'Operator', \"Thank you.

Organically, we continue to generate solid sales in a wireless carrier ecosystem in addition to growing our distribution business.\", 'Inorganically, we benefited from a full quarter of sales from C Enterprises and saw their sales improved significantly during the first quarter as the team performed very well. The C Enterprises acquisition is a great example of our ability to bolt-on a complementary business and then enhance their growth by making targeted investments and including them as part of our organization and culture.', \"It’s this combination of healthy organic and inorganic growth that gives me confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $100 million in sales in the next couple of years. I'll talk more about that later in the call.\", \"Through the first three quarters this year, we're almost flat to last year through three quarters, even with last year's huge Q2, if I were to summarize simply how we're performing this year is that our core business has experienced nice organic growth, our acquisition has performed well and our concentrated Tier-1 wireless carrier business is still delivering nice results, though as expected, they’re at a lower pace so far compared to last year and the timing of sales can be inconsistent.\", \"We feel good about our potential to continue organic growth in our core business, and accept the carrier related spending can cause wild swings for us. But we love that business and the opportunities that it presents us. Our strategy of getting to the end user customers and then making it easy for them to purchase in whatever way they prefer is no more apparent than in a wireless carrier ecosystem. And we're working hard to leverage those successes into new relationships and projects.\", \"In the third quarter, we also delivered net income of over $1 million. We did see a little pressure on our margins, which Mark will explain and talk more about in a few minutes. As we've said many times previously, we're proud that we can make money and be profitable at varying revenue levels. So even as revenues and margins move around a little bit as we transform the company and grow, we have a cost structure that's flexible and allows us to be very profitable.\", 'As I talked about on prior calls, the macro headwinds of wage pressures and our relationships with tariffs can affect our margins sometimes here is, since the costs associated with our production teams is built into our gross margin line and material delays can obviously slow us down.', \"We've taken the opportunity to invest in our people and operations to allow for increased production capacity at multiple of our locations. Rewarding and retaining our production talent is crucial for us and I'm thankful to be able to provide increases, so these loyal team members can share in our success.\", \"We're planning for our future and these [events] should allow us to support much higher revenue levels as we work to grow the business.\", \"Our backlog at quarter end was $8 million on third quarter bookings of $13.4 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we've seen backlog increase further and it currently stands at just above $10 million.\", \"This again illustrates the nature of our business where the significant volume of potential orders in our pipeline, and the timing of those orders can affect frequent changes to our backlog when a snapshot is taken at quarter-end. In other words, with sales volumes like ours, a million or 2 million purchase order can cause wild swings in a few days. As I've said several times in the past, this is about long-term transformation of the company and while an update every quarter is healthy, our results are easier to understand with a long-term view.\", \"I'm pleased with our bookings in Q3 and on that topic it’s important to note that a large portion of C Enterprises business is booking shift in a very short period of time meeting their sales will show up in our bookings number but often won't be material in our long-term backlog number.\", \"It's all about timing. Going forward we’ll continue to provide both a backlog and booking number each quarter as we've been doing in order to give visibility into how we're executing across our entire organization. During the quarter, we generated continuous sales from the Tier-1 wireless carrier ecosystem. Most of that is showing up in our Custom Cable segment and delivered by our Cables Unlimited team in Long Island, New York which performed extremely well.\", \"We also saw increased business from our distribution channels, as evidenced by the continued growth we're experiencing in our RF Cable and Connector segment which grew about 4% sequentially and a little over 10% year-over-year. This represents the third straight quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year for this segment, underscoring the success we're seeing in executing our strategy to drive more business through distribution.\", \"While the wireless ecosystem continues to be our biggest opportunity, we also see significant opportunities for growth in other areas. One of these is the Transportation segment where we saw some good sales growth this quarter, and believe there's an opportunity for both our custom and run rate products.\", \"We're just getting going with a new OEM customer that has a large public transportation opportunity that we feel very positive about. This is another good example of how we're working and starting to be successful in expanding the reach of our products beyond our historical target markets. We continue to see steady opportunities in other OEM market segments, which are primarily the industrial markets such as manufacturing, aerospace, defense, utilities, oil and gas, mining and agriculture.\", \"As I mentioned earlier, our strategy focuses on generating both organic growth through our continued penetration of our key market segments and also inorganic growth. As we acquire complementary companies, we believe we can help those businesses through investment and providing a reinvigorated approach to growth as they become aligned around a common set of larger goals. The acquisition of C Enterprises is a good example of how we're redeploying capital in a solid way to grow the business. In fact, I'm pleased to report that for the third quarter, C Enterprises generated sales of more than $3 million, well ahead of their historical annual run rate of $8.7 million.\", \"We don't necessarily expect that C Enterprises has achieved -- already achieved a consistent new run rate. But we've proven that in a fairly short time, we can generate a much higher revenue and profitability level in that business. As we know that the time we acquired C Enterprises, their margins were a little lower than our overall blended margins for the business. And so a bigger revenue contribution from them is going to impact our overall margins a little bit, which we saw in the third quarter. But as we've been able to expand the revenue line, we've been working to increase their margins, I have seen some decent progress.\", \"We continue to pursue a very robust and growing pipeline of acquisition candidates, our balance sheet remains strong and provides us with significant resources to go after additional acquisitions that make sense. And there's still a possibility of additional acquisitions this fiscal year. As far as acquisition targets, I'm generally interested in companies in the $10 million to $20 million revenue range to give us access to new product set and new customers or segments.\", \"I'd still love to find some larger potential acquisition targets in the range of $25 million to $30 million in sales. Every acquisition takes a lot of effort to integrate, in addition to the legal costs and other related costs. So I would rather put those resources to work on something larger and gain even more economies of scale. On a related note, I don't ever underestimate the importance of cultural fit when working through due diligence in an acquisition process. We're looking for talented like-minded leaders who want to be part of a positive long-term growth story. We want to get acquisitions right and not just go fast.\", \"As I had mentioned before, one area of product focus is expanding our overall offer of the small cell bill of materials, so we can capitalize on the identification opportunity related to the 5G build-out. We're also looking to potentially own other passive components that we can sell through our growing distribution channel.\", \"The 5G spend continues to be a big future opportunity, though not something we're consistently benefiting from today, we're having some good conversations on small cell applications, as well as on hybrid fiber opportunities that we believe will position us well for when that 5G spend accelerates.\", \"But we really haven't seen any change from the inconsistent spending pattern that's out there for 5G. We continue to see our distributed antenna system products perform well. And in small cell, we have numerous conversations going on with carriers, neutral hosts and other integrators on both standard products, and hybrid fiber solutions to try to spread out and get a stronger foothold in those markets.\", \"Our Cables Unlimited Group, which is the Long Island location where our team handled the hybrid fiber business has been doing such a good job getting products build and out the door that we've been given some new opportunities to do additional product types, mostly related to traditional wireless macro sites, which has resulted in some potential new customers. Not all these have come to fruition yet, but from a customer standpoint, we think we've gained exposure to some additional pieces of business that can diversify us a little bit while we also continue to service our Tier-1 carrier customer extremely well.\", \"In the coming months, we’ll continue to work on key initiatives to further evolve the company with a positive growth culture and sales mindset. To that end, we're working to add our upgraded talent in key positions as we find savings through synergies and redundancies, we redeploy that capital to invest in the right talent to help move us forward. As I mentioned on a prior call, we've been reviewing our overall sales organization and expect to launch a modified sales structure before the new fiscal year to capitalize on our offer to the market and to further our approach of doing business the way our customers want to do business.\", \"Earlier, I shared that we've added production capacity over the past two years at multiple locations. We still have some best practice work to do on our operations and facilities. And think that over the next several quarters, we can make even more progress toward upgrading our capabilities.\", \"Finally, returning to the results, we're pleased with the steady progress that we're making in our multi-year transformation of the company. Through nine months this year, we're basically flat to the first nine months last year, which included that huge second quarter.\", 'As we look ahead at our anticipated results, we expect to achieve year-over-year sales growth in both the fourth quarter and for our fiscal 2019 full-year. We also continue to execute well on our long-term growth plan and work toward our goal of reaching $100 million in sales over the next few years. That plan calls for low double-digit organic growth and layering in M&A for inorganic growth.', \"I don't expect to get the mix of those two things exactly right every quarter. And as I mentioned, the timing of carrier spend plays a big part in our organic growth. We still have lots of hard work ahead of us as we work on our fiscal 2020 goals and accountabilities for our teams, we feel good about our core business growth and are diligent about our redeployment of capital to continue driving growth. I'm very pleased with where we are so far for the year, and we're getting better at delivering consistent and more predictable results.\", \"With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark Turfler for a detailed review and discussion of the financial results for the quarter. Mark?\", 'Mark Turfler', 'Thank you, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. Our net sales in the third quarter were $15.5 million an increase of $1.9 million or 14% compared to the preceding second quarter an increase of $3.7 million or 31% compared to the third quarter year-ago. The increase in net sales reflects a full quarter of sales contribution from C Enterprises as well as growth in both our traditional run rate business and our project work in the OEM and wireless carrier markets. Gross profit for the third quarter was $4.3 million, an increase of 4% compared to the preceding second quarter and up 6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018.', 'Gross margins were 28% of net sales declined when compared to 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter primarily due to product mix as the product set our Tier-1 wireless carrier customer bought this past quarter happened to have a lower margin. In addition, we increased wages at all of our sites in order to reward and retain our protection workforce and in some cases to meet state mandated minimum wage requirements.', 'Selling and general expenses were $2.6 million, or 17% of sales, compared to $1.8 million or 15% of sales in the third quarter last year. The $8.8 million increase was primarily due to absorption of the additional selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises business as well as increased compensation due to the timing of bonus accruals. In addition the most recent quarter also included cost related to marketing programs geared to increased sales with our distribution partners.', 'We also incurred cost related to the evaluation of ongoing strategic acquisition transaction. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share compared to $1.1 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the preceding second quarter and $1.6 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.', \"Turning to the nine months of fiscal 2019, net sales were $39.8 million compared to $40.3 million last year, which as most of you know included the largest series of orders in the company's history. Gross profit for the first nine months was $11.5 million compared to $14.1 million while gross margins were 29% of sales compared to 35% of sales in the same period last year. The decline in gross margins was primarily due to the product mix that the Custom Cabling segment as well as increased wages for production team.\", 'Selling and general expenses were $7 million, or 18% of sales compared to $6.6 million or 16% of sales in the first nine months last year. The increase in selling and general expenses was primarily due to the absorption of the selling and general expenses of the newly acquired C Enterprises business and one-time cost of $100,000 related to this acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 partially offset by a decrease in commission expense.', 'Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 was $2.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $5.1 million or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period last year. At July 31, 2019 working capital was $26.7 million, up almost $3 million, since year-end, current ratio was 6 to 1 and there was no outstanding debt. Cash and cash equivalent was $13.3 million at the end of the third quarter, down from $13.9 million at the prior quarter-end.', \"This decrease is partially due to the timing and a collection of our increased receivable balance that resulted from sales growth during our recently completed third quarter. For the first nine months today, we've provided our shareholders a return on our investment of $0.06 per share cash dividend and we recently declared our 37th consecutive quarterly cash dividend up $0.02 per share. That concludes my discussion. I’ll now turn the call back to Rob.\", 'Rob Dawson', 'Thank you, Mark. As our financial results illustrate, we continue to execute well in our long-term growth plan. We generated solid sales growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the third quarter. This increase reflects healthy growth both organically and through our recent acquisition. We remain very focused on our key initiatives to leverage our strong customer relationships and channel partnerships to further expand our footprint in the marketplace, as well as to bring more complementary companies into the fold as we march towards our goal of reaching $100 million in sales over the next few years.', \"We appreciate the partnerships with our customers, distributors and suppliers, the hard work of our employees and the support of our shareholders. With that, I would like to open the floor to questions. Dory, we're ready to take our first question.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Josh Nichols with FBR. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Josh Nichols', 'Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask looks like as far as how much of the Custom Cabling business, is that really direct to carriers at this point for the quarter?', 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, we don't really break it down that way. But it's a pretty meaningful amount. And if you look at our growth over the last year in that segment other than you've got an acquisition thrown in there but the majority of our growth last year and it kind of continues quarter-to-quarter now has come out of that, that direct business or it's going to that same handful of customers, even if it did directly, we sort of we had it going both directly and indirectly, but it ends up in the same place to allow for the build.\", 'Josh Nichols', 'And is that business subject to all like any of these long-term contracts or purchase orders, or is it just very quick term business with the formalized longer term agreements in place?', 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so we have master service agreements in place with all the key customers in that space. And in that process, we've been through kind of the traditional bidding that goes on in order to win and then retain that business. So we have -- we have long-term relationships in place. We the way that that's handled though is we take purchase orders spread out over the course of time, when needed. We work closely with the various carriers and integrators to understand their needs and try to project as best possible but as my comments kind of pointed out, it's starts and stops and kind of a holding fashion isn't necessarily consistent, but we're communicating directly with them daily and weekly to talk through those projections. So it's a it's a long-term agreement that they draw against when needed.\", 'Josh Nichols', 'All right. And could you dive into a little bit about some of these key customers like which carriers you have these MSAs with specifically?', 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so we don't actually disclose that and that's a long standing approach that we've had, it’s the same customer we've been working with for a few years now. And then various folks within their services ecosystem that we do business with as well. But we've been asked to keep that to ourselves, let's say. So we don't disclose it that way. There's only so many potential customers out there though I recognize that.\", 'Josh Nichols', \"And then I guess what's really the differentiator between you and some of the other competitors both large and small that enable you to win some of this cell tower cabling business specifically?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so I think there's a couple of things I mean, our engineering capabilities are really good especially on the hybrid fiber, power and fiber in one, in one cable, those designs are really great quality and the team has done a good job of putting those together and then I think our flexibility and then customer service and turnaround time, we're very customer friendly in the sense that we have a Custom Cable segment for reason, we call that for a reason, it doesn't have to be a standard off-the-shelf thing and while a lot of our larger competitors maybe would prefer to do a much larger run with hundreds or thousands of the same exact cable.\", 'When you get into the macro sites in particular that are being hybrid fiber fed for the remote Radiohead deployments. The links are inconsistent, the breakout of how many fibers and or pieces of copper or the sizes of copper that go into those change pretty consistently. So I think it fits right into our wheelhouse of, we can handle a significant volume, but we can tweak the designs and the production capabilities around that and still hit reasonable timelines where we allow our customers to do their network deployments.', \"So I think generally in that business, that's the reason for it. I think that same concept sort of follows through across our entire business, we have enough scale, where I think we can outcompete some of the little localized competitors that we have, it's a pretty fragmented market at that level. And then when we get into more of the competition with the big multinational, in some cases multi-billion dollar companies out there were designed for great quality, flexibility and design and fast turn kinds of business.\", 'Josh Nichols', \"And then just diving in since looks like things are going pretty well at C Enterprises you mentioned, could you kind of help make sense, I mean it seems like a pretty bargain basement purchase price, if I'm correct, it's like $600,000 but they're doing $7 million in revenue in just this quarter alone, they did over three like why was that such a bargain?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"We talked some about that at the time of the deal. And I think the ownership and leadership team there, we had some good, some good conversations and recognize that in combination with a larger entity and sharing some of the strategies and go-to-market capabilities specifically from a distribution perspective, which is generally how they go-to-market, that together maybe we were stronger than separate. So I think we've invested in some additional resources there which allows them to perform, the sales team did a great job of dragging in some additional levels of business.\", \"And I just think generally that team has benefited from having some investment being a part of something bigger. Yes, I mean we, by all accounts, I think it was a -- it was a great deal. But I think there was a business that was roughly breakeven, when we acquired it, and we needed to do some investments. And we were happy to do that and thankful as the way that they're performing.\", 'Josh Nichols', 'Excellent, that provides some clarity. And then aside from the scale, could you talk a little bit about from a strategic perspective, what C Enterprises brings to the company regarding your new customers or product offerings?', 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, it’s a great question. So I think on the customer side, we've done business for a very long time with a lot of different distributors, we've beefed up our distribution approach even before doing the acquisition, two of their largest customers or two distributors that we've done business with for years and have just recently in the last couple of years started to really grow.\", \"So I think that the relationships that they had with those two largest distributors are very helpful for us. It gave us spread us out a little bit from a customer perspective into some additional big relationships. And on the product side, it gave us more of a fast turn fiber offer than what we've traditionally done. Our Cables Unlimited Group that came in through an acquisition several years ago, eight or nine years ago is great at fiber Corning Gold House just like C Enterprises is. But I think most of their work is on the custom side, higher ticket items that require more engineering. C Enterprises gives us that fast turn book and ship kind of business that goes into some more traditional applications, data centers, traditional telco, those kinds of things, as well as the capability to do fast turn small cell fiber offerings, which is something that we believe will give us a nice opportunity going forward as the spend increases there.\", 'Josh Nichols', \"And good to see the backlog numbers here at $10 million, just historically like, what's the company's time to deliver right on that fast turns typically, I would think?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Well, it depends. I think if you go back to two years ago, when I started here, our backlog was traditionally $2.5 million, we just didn't disclosed it because it was not a material number. And if you took that and put it out over the course of the year, magically, that ended up being about a monthly kind of turn or a little more than that. I think now we see ours is built both with things that are going to go out in the next quarter. And if you go back four or five quarters, you kind of see the trend where we generally ship out our backlog. And then some because we have the book and ship business.\", \"But the backlog never goes fully away, we have some of that, some portion of that, that is long standing and gets drawn against over the course of several months or a few quarters. Generally though, whatever is in our backlog will go out within the fiscal year. So that's why I'm pleased to see that we're, we're booking new business and sort of backfilling that backlog every quarter at least for the last six or eight quarters.\", 'Josh Nichols', \"And then, just because you mentioned it for small cell been a big longer term growth opportunity like where's that now as far as today but the piece of business and where do you think that's going to be with the 5G rollout and transition over the next like 24 months or so?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, I think it's a small piece of our business today. We shipped some of our traditional coaxial offer into it. We're working on some fiber fed small cell opportunities today. I think the spend there is interesting because the local legislation comes into play. I think if you were to ask any carrier trying to deploy small cells, the design different location to location both because there may be different technical requirements, but also because local municipalities and local legislation isn't making it particularly easy to deploy those in a fast way. So I expect that to accelerate. I think certain cities and counties have found ways to streamline that process but\", \"I don't expect that the real spend there to start freeing up until next year is the hope, although we see opportunities here and there for different designs, and I think it still seems to be hung up and a lot of the political conversation around wireless and it look okay, is it safe? Some of those conversations that have proven out many times that it's safe, but that still drives a lot of the local conversation which delays it.\", 'Josh Nichols', \"Great, thanks. That's it for me. I’ll hop back in the queue.\", 'Rob Dawson', 'Thanks Josh.', 'Operator', 'Our next question today comes from Aaron Martin with AIGH Investment Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Aaron Martin', \"Hi, it’s Aaron Martin from AIGH. Congrats on another good quarter. Can you give us little more quantify about the gross margin at C Enterprises, is it and the improvements you're making there? What kind of improvements can we expect or talking about one or two percentage points can (inaudible) long-term will get to three to five. What kind of the scale of what we're talking about here?\", 'Rob Dawson', 'Aaron, specifically related to the C Enterprises is that the question?', 'Aaron Martin', 'Well, let’s start there and then we’ll move on.', 'Rob Dawson', \"Okay. Got it. Yes, so I think as we disclose when we made the acquisition and again in our comments today, margins generally, they're a little lower than our blended margins. Some of their product lines are more commoditized maybe than some of the other ones that we've traditionally had. We knew that going in and I think the team there has done a great job of finding the better opportunities that you know, we get paid for the value that I think we deserve, and the fast turn business and the work that that team does. So we're expecting it to come up a little bit. I don't think we expect an overnight massive change and they're not terribly low, Martin. They're not horrible, but when that -- when the performance there is as strong as it was, it's going to have an impact on obviously the average overall.\", \"So we've seen it come up a little bit, I think we're expecting it to continue coming up a few percentage points is kind of our goal at this point to really test and see what's possible both on the existing products but also as we move into some additional applications.\", 'Aaron Martin', \"Okay. And on the overall company obviously besides to the C Enterprises, it seems sounds like in the legacy business, there was reduction to gross margins quarter based on investments in capacity. Longer term putting this aside, we've talked about $100 million revenue run rate of goal. Can we talk about a long-term gross margin operating margin goal?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Well, so yes on the gross line, it’s little easier to talk about on that. And I think it's not unlike what we've talked about previously, that 30% or low 30s is a good spot for us with the product mix that we have today. I think as I said on the prior call, when asked kind of a long-term question, How high can the number go? Look, I think getting it up into the low 30s is a solid place with the product mix that we have today, as that mix changes, because our goal is to bring in additional higher margin product lines and drive opportunities in those spaces both organically as well as on the acquisition side.\", \"I think we can keep those margins back up there, 30% and above in the short term, long-term, I don't definitively know this quarter was a great example of when we performed really, really well in a couple of key customer accounts and or product lines, the customer happen to order some things that have that had a lower margin, if the mix has been a little different, those margins could have been up at that 30% number. So it's harder to put a long-term number in place. But I think our goal remains to stay 30% or above. And this quarter was an example of we did some investments on the production side, assuming that we're going to keep driving growth, not just short term, but going long-term.\", \"And we're going to have to have the right kind of people in place on the production teams to do that. Some of that was state mandated as well. We happen to be in locations where wage pressure is being mandated, which that's fine. It's built in there. And I think I'm appreciative of the fact that we can bounce around a little bit there though, our goal is to stay back at that 30% or above.\", 'Aaron Martin', 'Got it. And we talked about still looking out for Q4 that expect to grow year-over-year, sequential quarter and on the whole year, can we grow year-over-year even excluding the C Enterprises revenue?', 'Rob Dawson', \"There's an outside chance we could, I think it’s hard to know exactly. And we've got some meaningful things in our pipeline, it's got come down to timing really, my expectation and I think what we’ve seen with C Enterprises is I'm having a harder time calling that inorganic growth, the more days that go by and then being a part of the company where we're doing a good job of sharing business between the various locations and kind of traditional different sales models. They've done a nice job of working together both with the other West Coast business as well as the East Coast operations. So again, it's tougher to call that inorganic but I think your question is a fair one, which it would take some work from a carrier spend perspective in particular to get us to achieve that organic growth year-over-year not including anything from C Enterprises.\", 'Aaron Martin', 'Okay, thank you very much.', 'Rob Dawson', 'Thanks Aaron.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Hal Granger, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.', 'Hal Granger', \"Hi guys, thanks for taking my call, my question. Congratulations on forward in increasing your revenues. That's great.\", 'Rob Dawson', 'Thank you.', 'Hal Granger', \"Mark, I wonder if you could address the accounts receivable, the sales were up year-over-year of 31% in the quarter, cash receivables were up 69%. Was is that something you'd expect because of C Enterprises mix or can you talk about what's going on there?\", 'Mark Turfler', \"Sure. Part of that is to the timing, a lot of it is timing, when the sales actually occur. But in addition, as a result of getting some new businesses sometimes we change the terms to accommodate what may work well for our customer and us as it relates to receivables and their payments. So sometimes it comes down to timing as to when they're going to make payments and when we receive the cash, so if you would also notice, we have I think $2,000 of bad debt over the first nine months, so the collections not an issue, we’ve not had that in the past. So again when it comes down to, it's just simply a timing issue.\", 'Hal Granger', \"Okay, thank you. Regarding C Enterprises, would you consider that the integration is pretty much, well how is that going? Is that pretty much done now? And now it's part of your ongoing operations or there's still more to go in integration?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so I think we've done well there and they've been great at joining the team and performing well against the set of goals. As we get ready to go into a new fiscal year here and another month and a half or so, we're kind of putting some more operational things in place. I mentioned sales structure, we're going to get a little further down the path of getting our distribution sales teams operating more closely together. Because traditionally, while we may have called on some of the same customers, talking to completely different groups in some cases, so I think getting those relationships more centralized and getting us set up in a way that it makes it easier for our customers who do business with us. That's a big step for us, getting the distribution model in place and the direct OEM model in place as two distinct things with a distinct operating organization and sets goals.\", \"So that’s a piece of what we need to do. In the short term, slightly longer term, I think we've done a decent job on getting shared business moving between the locations, but there's probably some operational opportunities but just with similar kinds of production capabilities on both coasts that we can likely leverage out of that as well.\", 'Hal Granger', \"Okay, thank you, Rob. So drilling down on the C Enterprises, margins again. You're talking about gross profit margins are a bit less than then the rest of RF Industries. If you looked at net income profit margins, which maybe you don't even breakout or take by yourself, but regarding C Enterprises, is that also a little bit below or is that or is C Enterprises indeed showing at net loss?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, we don't necessarily break it out that way. But I'll give you a general answer, which is that that business is profitable for us at this point. And when we did the acquisition, we said we expected it to be immediately accretive through some things that we put in place to allow that and just allocation of the right people. And that continues to be the case. So that's a money making operation for us in this quarter, but it's been great for us through the roughly four and a half months that we've had them on board.\", 'Hal Granger', \"Okay, thank you. That's great. If I can make a comment, I saw your Q came out 20 minutes before the call along with of course your press release. It would be fantastic that if we had more time to review the Q before the call, but overall, I think your level of communication and transparency is fantastic, so that’s all.\", 'Rob Dawson', \"I appreciate that, Hal. Yes, we've tried a few different timings on when we put something out and when we have the call. And this is the one that we've kind of settled on for now. But I appreciate the feedback.\", 'Hal Granger', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from (inaudible) another Private Investor. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Hello, congratulations on great results.', 'Rob Dawson', 'Thank you.', 'Unidentified Analyst', \"So I guess my first question is about salaries, it seems that it has a bit of a negative leverage here because we had great, great revenues, but since salaries seems to have gone up in the revenues, and that's both in the cost of goods sold and in the various operating expenses. So is it, I mean, I understand San Diego is kind of an expensive place to live. But is that kind of like a one-time step function due to certain legal changes? Or is that something to continue, would we be able to get positive leverage in the future?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so fair question and versus it being salary changes, most of the increases that we experienced show up on a gross margin line, because it's our production folks. So primarily hourly workers and in some cases, there have not been increases there in a few years, frankly. And so I think what you've seen is we've gone through increases that all locations to try to get people at the right market level, in many cases well above the mandatory minimum wage that exists in that location.\", \"There are further mandates over the course of the next few years in multiple places where we do have operations. But I think we've done a decent job of investing correctly in the people to allow us to grow the revenue line and keep up and these are the folks that are doing the actual production work on cable assemblies in particular, whether that's fiber or coax, or a combination thereof. So I think you did see a step change function in this quarter is now built into our gross margin line. And it's incumbent upon us to perform well, price things right and reclaim that margin level that we believe we deserve.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'All right. Is there opportunities to use automation to kind of the decrease the percentage of like human labor costs?', 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, so we've done a decent amount of that, I think it depends on the business, the word Custom showing up in any kind of our operation, sort of lends itself to there's a certain level of automation, but not everything can be automated. So I think we've done a decent job of automating what we can, when I first got here, that was something I was on a quest to go find who has an automated completely, and the issue pops up that, you can automate it for a million of the exact same thing, when you do 100 of the same thing and then change to something else, the ROI on that upfront investment becomes pretty tough to pull off. So there may come a scale level where we find an opportunity to do that again, but I think today we're generally kind of looking at the automation that we can do is already built into the bulk of the business.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"All right, and so in general, would you say that the trend in the industry is for going in your favor for more different, more customized solutions? Or is it, is it the case that sort of customized solutions have been tried out now? And then in the near future, they'll become like, kind of a large scale homogenous deployment?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, I think the scale of custom deployments, I don't see people planning better. And I say that because that that points itself to the fast turn business as well, there’s a custom part, which is you need 50, or 100, or 200, or something, or maybe you need 10. That's one component. The other is, and I needed in three days, in seven days, in 10 days, whatever the time frame might be, those two things combined, I don't think you're going to go away anytime soon, as I was leaving our office earlier today, for example there was a gentleman picking up cable assemblies, because he's got a job that he has to do and install on for a carrier, that pickup business and the availability for a contractor to back a truck, load it up with what he needs and get out and do the work doesn't seem to be changing and what small cells, if anything, I feel like it's going to get that much more so into a fast turn place in order, needs to be ready in a few days, and then available at the right location.\", \"So I feel like at least a portion of the business is going to stay the way that it is now, I think if we're talking both deployments, somebody wants to buy a million feet of fiber optic cable, that's not a space that we play in. And those will continue to be a large scale deal that gets deployed over the course of several years versus site by site where 100 sites, there may be two that are the same. And the rest of them are varied in nature which fits very well into our skill set.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', \"All right. That's good to hear. And, lastly book-to-bill ratio below one and I asked this question last quarter as well. I assume this is nothing to worry about just because your business is a lot of like short term models quickly fulfilled. So the kind of the book-to-bill ratio is not something that signifies what will happen the next quarter. Is that still correct?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"That's correct. Yes, it points the nature of our business, it is going to be booked and shipped in a very short period of time, which will throw off those kinds of ratios, but the best way to look at kind of the health of the business, our backlog remains strong. And this was another example as this quarter ended, where if the motors had to come in two, three, five days earlier than our backlog would have been even higher at quarter end, instead it ended at eight and then subsequent, it's popped back up to 10 again. So keeping by us disclosing our level of bookings in a quarter and where that leaves us for a backlog, we feel like we're being really transparent on kind of the health of the business around those various metrics.\", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay, well, that is it for me. Good luck. And thanks for taking my questions.', 'Rob Dawson', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Charles Hilton, Private Investor. Please go ahead.', 'Charles Hilton', 'An interesting call, congratulations.', 'Rob Dawson', 'Thanks.', 'Charles Hilton', \"It’s clear the everybody's working very hard there, it’s apparent because I know a few people, and they're never available for lunch. But anyway, I wonder if the cash, the company has always been known for having a good cash position. I wonder how hard it has been working over this last quarter? And I wonder how it’s distributed, CDs with your favorite bank that you may be locked in but hopefully not. Anything else? Is there anything you can share with us? And what maybe the average yield was for the last three months or nine months, whatever you prefer?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"Yes, Mark just stepped back into the room. So the question is around our deployment of cash, and what kind of return we're seeing on that cash, whether that's CDs or other things? And is there any kind of return we can disclose for the last three months, nine months putting that cash to work.\", 'Mark Turfler', \"Good question. We have looked at opportunities right now, unfortunately, there aren't a lot. We kept him in a fairly safe investment.\", \"And quite frankly our earnings is much as we possibly can. But at the moment, we're just keeping it in, in a money market account until we see a better opportunity.\", 'Charles Hilton', \"Okay, so you're not going -- of the ball. In other words, you can't boast of any younger bank eager for your business that might be giving you an advantage against probably your favorite bank that is maybe giving you average or maybe even a below average?\", 'Rob Dawson', \"So yes, I don't think we have a favorite bank. I certainly don't. But I appreciate the question. I think the cash position we have. Our goal is to redeploy that cash, specifically in M&A. So I get it, we could probably do better on from an earning, putting that cash to work in earnings perspective.

Sir, please proceed.', 'Greg Roberts', 'Thanks Hector, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call.', 'During fiscal 2019 we continued to execute on our long-term strategic plan to expand our platforms of products and services, as well as increase our market share in the global precious metals market.', 'The year was highlighted by several operational achievements, perhaps most notably the successful $100 million asset-based securitization completed in the first quarter, as well as our online application and account management system we launched in our secured lending segment. These achievements were complimented by a number of incremental upgrades and initiatives we implemented across our organization with the goal of driving greater efficiencies and an improved customer experience.', 'Our continued execution in operational progress we made throughout the year helped to drive a meaningful improvement in our key financial metrics as well. This included a 9% increase in gross profit and a 20% increase in interest income, as well as a return to profitability.', 'We were able to achieve these improvements despite headwinds in the precious metals market throughout the year, including a particularly challenging fourth quarter where demand for physical gold was weak and volumes were down compared to the prior quarter. Nevertheless, our solid performance for the full fiscal year demonstrates the true durability of our diversified business model.', \"Before I talk more about our platform business segments and growth opportunities, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Cary Dickson, who will walk you through our financial performance for fiscal Q4 and full year 2019. Cary?\", 'Cary Dickson', 'Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon to everybody.', 'Turning to our financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year ended June 30, 2019. Our revenues for fiscal Q4, 2019 decreased 52% to $850 million from $1.77 billion in Q4 of last year. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to lower forward sales, gold ounces sold and silver price offset by an increase in the total amount of silver ounce sold.', 'Forward sales represented $620 million of the $960 million decrease. For the full-year, our revenues decreased 37% to $4.78 billion from $7.61 billion in the same year ago period. The decrease is primarily due to lower forward sales representing approximately $2.8 billion of the aggregate change, lower gold and silver prices and lower gold ounces sold offset by an increase in the total amount of silver ounces sold.', 'To further clarify the decrease in sales for the quarter and the full-year it is important to note that the company fully hedges its inventories at all times typically through a combination of forwards and futures contracts. Forward sales contract executed for hedging purposes are required to be included in revenues where our future sales contract executed for similar purposes are not.', 'During the most recent fiscal year 2019, the company entered into significantly fewer forward sales contracts for hedging purposes than in the previous fiscal year which materially decreases revenues. In other words the majority of our revenue decrease in fiscal 2019 is due to lower forward sales and not indicated of a material change in our physical sales traded for profit purposes.', 'This is one of the primary reasons the company considers ounce volumes to be a key metric performance and we remind investors to review both ounce volume trends, as well as gross profit dollars to gain a more complete view of the company’s performance.', 'Gross profits for the fiscal Q4 2019 period increased 11% to $6.5 million or 0.6% of revenue from $5.8 million or 0.33% of revenue in Q4 of last year. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved gross profits from our wholesale trading and ancillary services and direct sales segments.', 'For the full year gross profit increased 9% to 32.0 million or 6.67% of revenue from $29.4 million or 0.39% of revenue in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved gross profits of our wholesale trading and ancillary segment and our direct sales segments offset by lower trading profits.', 'Turning to our expenses, SG&A expenses for fiscal Q4 of 2019 increased 10% to $8.4 million from $7.7 million in Q4 of last year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs within the wholesale trading and ancillary services segments related primarily to the retention and filling a number of key management positions, nonrecurring severance costs in our direct sales segment partially offset by lower external consulting costs primarily in the IT and the finance area.', 'For fiscal 2019, SG&A expenses decreased 3% to $32.5 million from $33.4 million last year. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in IT consulting related cost of $0.8 million, lower investigatory acquisition costs of $0.6 million, lower advertising costs of $0.8 million and lower legal costs of $0.4 million which were partially offset by higher compensation costs of $1.3 million.', 'Interest income for fiscal Q4 of 2019 decreased 6% to $5.3 million from $5.6 million in Q4 of last year. The decrease is driven primarily by lower interest income associated with our wholesale trading and ancillary segment partially offset by higher interest income associated with our secured lending segment.', 'For the full year interest income increased 20% to $19.3 million from $16.1 million in fiscal 2018. The increase is primarily driven by an increase in interest income of our wholesale trading and ancillary service segment of $2.1 million of which 1.7 related to customer repurchase arrangements, as well as an increase in interest income from our secured lending segment of 1.0 million due principally to an increase in the value of the secured loan portfolio.', 'Interest expense for fiscal Q4 2019 increased 13% to $4.7 million from $4.2 million in Q4 of last year. The increase is primarily due to the newly issued notes payable related to our secured lending segment partially offset by a reduction of interest expense from product financing arrangements and the repayment of the Goldline credit facility.', 'For fiscal 2019, interest expense increased 23% to $17.1 million from $13.9 million last year. In comparison to the same year ago period, interest expense increased $4.3 million related to the recently issued notes payable and $1.0 million related to liability on borrowed metals. This was partially offset by a decrease of $1.1 million related to the product financing arrangements, $0.4 million related to the trading credit facility and $0.3 million related to the repayment of the Goldline credit facility.', 'For the fourth quarter of 2019, our net loss totaled 823,000 or $0.12 per diluted share. This was an improvement from a net loss of $3 million or 0.43% - or $0.43 per diluted share in Q4 of last year. For the full-year net income totaled $2.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share an improvement from the net loss of $3.4 million or 48% per diluted share in fiscal 2018.', 'Shifting gears to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $8.3 million of cash compared to $6.3 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Our tangible network at the end of the quarter totaled $57.8 million which compares to $58.1 million at the end of the prior quarter and $53.4 million at the end of fiscal 2018.', 'That completes my financial summary. Now I’ll turn the call over to Thor who will provide an update on our key performance metrics. Thor?', 'Thor Gjerdrum', 'Thanks Cary.', 'Turning to our operational metrics for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 we sold 350,000 ounces of gold in Q4 which is down 26% from the prior quarter and down 40% from Q4 of last year. For the full year, we sold 1.8 million ounces of gold which is down 6% from the 1.9 million ounces we sold in fiscal 2018.', 'Turning to silver, we sold 12.5 million ounces in Q4 which is down 25% from the prior quarter but up 46% from Q4 of last year. For the full-year 2019, silver ounces sold increased 46% to $67.6 million ounces from $46.5 million ounces in the comparable period last year.', 'Looking at our second key metric, wholesale trading ticket volume which represents the total number of product orders processed at our trading desk decreased 22% to 24,300 tickets from the prior quarter and decreased 6% from Q4 of last year. For the full year, trading ticket volume increased 5% to 120,300 tickets.', 'The third key metric we value is inventory turnover defined as the cost of sales divided by the average inventory during the relevant period. Inventory turnover is a measure of how quickly inventory has moved during the period.', 'For the fourth quarter, our inventory turnover ratio was 3.0 which is down 35% from 4.6 in the prior quarter and down 33% from 4.5 in Q4 of last year. For the full year, our inventory turnover rate was 16.6 compared to 26.8 in fiscal 2018.', 'The decrease in our inventory turn rate was primarily due to lower volumes of ounces sold on forward contracts and by higher average borrowed metal inventory balances partially offset by lower average product financing arrangements during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year.', 'And finally the number of secured loans at the end of the quarter totaled 2,806 which is of 9% from the prior quarter and down 20% from Q4 of last year. However, as of June 30, 2019 the dollar value of our CFC loan portfolio totaled $125.3 million compared to $110.4 million in Q4 of last year an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and 13% from Q4 of last year.', \"That concludes my prepared remarks. I now turn it back over to Greg to talk about the progress we've been making on our key operational initiatives. Greg?\", 'Greg Roberts', 'Thank you, Thor.', \"As I've emphasized on our last few calls the hub of our vertically integrated operating structure is A-Mark Global Logistics or as we call it AMGL which provides end-to-end logistics services to e-commerce leaders, our wholesale counterparts, as well as IRA custody and precious metal storage solutions. It was a busy and productive fiscal year for AMGL highlighted by the successful implementation of several strategic initiatives designed to increase our revenue streams and service offerings.\", 'Our new Vice President of Logistics, Chris Harte has spent the last few months on the job focusing on cost reduction measures and improving performance metrics all in an effort to generate new business for AMGL.', \"In May, we launched a program at AMGL to streamline our customer deposit and returns processes. While it's still in its early stages, the new program has expedited the overall processing, improved the customer experience and product quality, as well as reducing our shipping and packaging costs.\", 'It was a banner year for our secured lending segment. Most notably we completed $100 million asset-based securitization or ABS giving our subsidiary CFC the necessary capital to grow its business in loan portfolio to record levels. Our team was able to fill the ABS with secured loans in just 10 months and we are actively looking to expand the facility.', 'As I have said before by growing the value of our portfolio and introducing complementary finance products, we will increasingly benefit from the revenue diversification and interest income.', \"In May, we launched CFC’s new website and online application and account management system which marked the latest development in our ongoing strategy of injecting further technology into A-Mark's offerings. These improvements have helped us sufficiently secure new business, improve the customer service, and establish an environment for continuous innovation.\", \"Also during the fourth quarter, we launched a Goldline branded e-commerce site. Purpose of this site is to augment our telephone sales, as well as capture smaller order size. While it's still in its infancy, we’re excited about Goldline's new e-commerce offerings and the response we are seeing from customers.\", 'Our majority-owned minting facility SilverTowne continues to provide our company with a sustainable competitive advantage and has us uniquely positioned to meet any potential surges and demand for physical metals. SilverTowne Mint continued to perform well in fiscal 2019 giving us confidence to increase our majority state to 69%, as well as to extend our capital investments in the SilverTowne Mint.', \"These investments have substantially improved production efficiency, improved our product quality, and enhanced our design and minting capabilities which allows us to offer more unique and differentiated products to customers. It's worth noting that in addition to the mints proven ability to ramp up to meet surges in precious metal demand, it can also cost-effectively ramp down during silver periods to reduce operating costs. On top of this, the products the mint produces for third-parties allows the mint to level low its production as well.\", 'As I mentioned on our last call, we acquired a new die production capability, technology and equipment all of which is housed in Nevada and support the SilverTowne Mint. The asset purchase and integration is gone exceptionally well we were pleased with the continued improvement in our capabilities and product quality as we strive to fabricate and distribute best in class, private and sovereign mint products.', 'During fiscal 2020, we plan to devote resources to new growth areas with the goal of furthering our competitive position and expanding our platform. This means further scaling of our business both operationally and financially with expanded new offerings which we believe will in turn increase the predictability and profitability of our model.', 'In the first few months of fiscal 2020, we have seen that geopolitical uncertainty and global economic concerns have resulted in strong upward movement of both gold and silver prices particularly during the month of August 2019. While similar factors have historically resulted in robust demand for precious metals product, during our first fiscal 2020 quarter to-date we have not experienced unusually high demand and product premiums have remained range bound. A prolonged continuation of these continued conditions has the potential to improve performance in the near-term.', 'In the last 4 to 6 weeks we have started to see signs of an uptick in demand and an increased volatility, as well as product interest. We remain cautiously optimistic about our prospects especially given the macro backdrop, geopolitical environment and upcoming election year.', 'Looking at fiscal 2020 more broadly, we will continue to act opportunistically in the market taking advantage of attractive near-term trading opportunities while further scaling our business into continued success over the long-term.', \"Today A-Mark is in the most diversified position in our company's history with the strongest and most robust platform, customer base and business model. We are confident these factors will translate into financial and operational outperformance in 2020 compared to last year, as well as more predictable growth and increased profitability in the years ahead.\", \"Lastly, I want to add that this will be Cary's last earnings call for A-Mark. Cary has accepted a new position that is closer to his home, and will eliminate his long commute. While we were sad to see him go, he has positioned the company well for internal succession, and I'm happy to announce that Kathleen Simpson-Taylor, our current Executive Vice President and Corporate Controller has accepted my offer and will be assuming Cary’s role effective September 30, 2019. Kathleen’s background prior A-Mark experience and proven performance make her the ideal candidate for this role.\", \"I'm going to turn the call over one more time to Cary so he can say a few words.\", 'Cary Dickson', 'Thank you very much, Greg, I appreciate that.', \"I want to say to everybody I am very proud to have been part of the A-Mark's growth and expansion of the business to where it’s become today and I want thank Greg and the Board for supporting my decision to make this move. I believe the company is well-positioned to make this transition and I also believe Kathleen is the right candidate to assume this role which will allow continued commitment to the quality that we have here and the continuity that we have within the finance function.\", 'Greg Roberts', 'Hector, do you want to continue.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Sakai with Singular Research. Please proceed with your question.', 'Chris Sakai', 'I just had a question on your inventory level, can you give a breakdown as far as the percentage - how much is gold and how much is silver and as compared to previous inventory levels, I mean how has the level of gold and silver increased or decreased?', 'Greg Roberts', \"We don't generally break that down although we do have some reports internally that we do see the mix. I would say that the inventory currently is significantly weighted heavier to gold right now which has a little bit to do with what is been transpired in the marketplace between June, July and the beginning of August.\", \"The current move in gold prices which has been significant and we welcome them, and we - that's the business we're in, has resulted in mostly institutional buying and most of the movement in gold has been driven by purchases and inflow into the ETFs particularly GLD which you can see in their reports.\", 'It has resulted though in more physical selling of gold where a number of retail clients have taken some chips off the table and they have sold gold into the market and have been more sellers and then the newer buyers have not yet performed on new gold coin. So what that means is A-Mark has been a fairly significant buyer of older backdated gold coins which has increased our mix in our inventory, and we have been selling fewer new gold coins.', 'And you can see that particularly in the U.S. mint numbers which we always point people to, but the sale of new mint products up until about six weeks ago had been fairly stagnant at the U.S. mint and the Canadian mint and other sovereign mints. In the last six weeks, we have seen a pickup in gold sales to the retail public and we have taken advantage of that.', \"Fortunately, we have had an inventory of those coins which built up in July and June in the last 4 to 6 weeks we've been able to take advantage of that. So, I don't have any exact numbers for you on this call, but for the most part our gold has - gold inventory has been a little higher in the last few months.\", 'Chris Sakai', 'And then as far as Goldline business goes on - how is that been going, is it return to profitability or is it closed?', 'Greg Roberts', \"We’re still not profitable there. We’re still working on it. Again what we've seen in the last - in June and July in particular the end of last quarter and the first month of this quarter as we’ve found more precious metals - historic precious metals retail buyers have been selling back as opposed to buying new product at these prices.\", \"So we've kind of gotten through those headwinds as gold move from about $1,300 up to $1,500 and in the last six weeks we've seen a bit more volatility and we have seen some fairly good price movement particularly in gold up and down and that has resulted in a little bit better sales at Goldline.\", 'And before I would say August 15, this have been predominantly a gold move where gold prices have moved significantly and silver prices have been very stagnant. In the last six weeks if you just look at the charts you can see that silver has made a fairly good move, it’s retracted a little bit, but it made a pretty good move in the last 4 to 6 weeks which has resulted in a little bit more silver activity for us.', 'So again June/July very quiet particularly in retail sales of gold products across the board and through most of our customers and platforms. Last six weeks much more activity and a move in silver which has helped throughout our silver products across all of our sales platforms.', 'Operator', \"[Operator Instructions] At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Roberts for his closing remarks.\", 'Greg Roberts', \"Thank you, Hector. Thank you all for joining our call today.

Carl, the floor is yours.\", 'Carl Wolf', 'Thank you, Greg. Thank you everyone for joining us today. I like to welcome everyone to our second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. The second quarter of fiscal 2020 was highlighted by continued sales momentum as we aggressively market our products nationwide. To that end, we are very pleased with our progress with sales increasing 44% [to include] [ph] $1 million in the second quarter which drove net income to a record $0.4 million. ', 'Our revenue growth was driven by both new placements, effective merchandising events and continued success of our multi-channel marketing efforts. Our successful multi-pronged marketing efforts include radio campaign, social media efforts and continued work with QVC. I like to touch on a few of these now. ', \"We continue to see success in our SiriusXM radio advertising campaigns, as evidenced by the launch of our fourth campaign this year over Labor Day. The SiriusXM platform distributes up to 1,000 MamaMancini's commercials on all major talk and news channels reaching over 64 million consumers, an avenue which we have found as a cost effective way to drive shares across our various geographic locations with current and new customers to our products. \", 'On the social media side of things we continue to maintain a robust reach engaging new customers and encouraging repeat purchases. To date, we have 300,000 likes and continue to geo-target likely consumers who live within five miles of specific retail locations. As an example, we are presently using this medium to introduce our new pasta bowls in the South East.', \"Our QVC efforts have been a notable success as well with Dan Mancini live pitches driving impressive sales on their platform. In the period from Labor Day, the first week of October, we are scheduled to introduce many new offerings and will be on air seven times, a notable increase from the number we have traditionally done. As many of you are aware, QVC is the world's largest direct-to-consumer marketer and is available in over 100 million homes throughout the US. \", \"Before turning the call to Larry to review the financials, I wanted to also touch on some of our recent successes as announced on September 10 with respect to product placement and special merchandising events in over 2,500 tier one grocery retailer locations nationwide. These customers include well-known names such as Publix Super Markets, Sam's Club, which is a division of Walmart Inc., Albertsons Companies and Tops Markets. \", 'Notably we expect these locations to generate an additional 800,000 to $1.1 million in quarterly revenue beginning in this, the third quarter of fiscal 2020. In addition we have the potential of adding 2700 new locations with these retailers in the next six months, provided consumer acceptance is positive. ', \"Clearly this is a major opportunities for us and something we are very excited about as we move forward. The strong foundation we've established with the build out of our manufacturing capabilities, paired with our effective marketing efforts to-date have positioned us for a strong back half of fiscal 2020, which we firmly believe will help drive significant shareholder value as we move forward. \", 'Now before going further, I’d like to turn the call over to Larry Morgenstein, our Chief Financial Officer to walk through some key financial details from the second quarter of 2020. Larry. ', 'Larry Morgenstein ', 'Thank you, Carl. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 44% to $8.1 million, compared to $5.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. The revenue increase was primarily a result of increased sales with our largest customers, as well as new customer placements. A merchandising event with one customer during the quarter also contributed to the increase in sales.', 'Gross profits totaled $2.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profits as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 totaled 33.2% as compared to 36.5% in the same year-ago quarter, due to a change in product mix and cost of goods sold for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, including higher depreciation expense in comparison to the prior year comparable period, which negatively impacted gross profit by 2% of sales. As we grow our sales, we expect gross margins to increase as a result of manufacturing and plant efficiencies. ', 'Operating expenses totaled $2.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $1.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased primarily due to increases in postage and freight, commission expenses and royalty fees due to higher sales. Notably, operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from 34.2% to 27.6%. ', 'Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 totaled $0.4 million or $0.01 per share as compared to a net loss of $0.2 million or loss of $0.01 per share in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in net income was primarily a result of higher sales and gross profit, lower operating cost as a percentage of sales and lower interest and amortization of debt discount expenses. ', 'Cash and cash equivalents totaled $635,000 as of July 31, 2019 as compared to $347,000 as of July 31, 2018. During fiscal 2020, the company repaid $0.8 million of its senior debt. Cash flow from operations for the six-month period of fiscal 2020 was $0.9 million as compared to $1.4 million in the same year-ago period. We do not anticipate raising additional capital and we are confident that the cash on hand is sufficient to sustain operations as we grow. ', 'Finally, before we wrap-up the financial section, I want to touch base on our payables, which stood at 32 days outstanding as a consolidated basis at July 31, 2019. This is a notable improvement when compared to 33.6 days payable as seen at January 31, 2019 and 53.3 days payable outstanding at July 31, 2018. We expect the payables outstanding to continue and improve throughout fiscal 2020 as we continue to extract better pricing and better terms from our vendors.', 'This completes my comments. Let me turn over the call to Matt Brown, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Matt. ', 'Matt Brown', 'Thanks Larry. For those of you who have listened to me talk at the year-end call and at the Q1 call fiscal 2020, I continue to speak of plant expansion and equipment upgrades, all in an effort to not only become more efficient in our production, but to better position ourselves for future sales growth. ', 'Q2 fiscal 2020 certainly proved that as Carl and Larry just noted. Sales are up versus a year ago and operating expenses are down as a percentage of those sales. What we produced in the second quarter, through the plant, we produced with no additional shifts required. ', \"You've also heard me talk about the right mix of products to obtain the best margins from the plant. In Q2, fiscal 2020 was the perfect opportunity to showcase this as our kit business, pasta bowls and other prepared in-store products continued to take off. \", 'With these new items we continued to expand our existing customer footprint. We recently announced new product placement or special promotional activity as Carl mentioned earlier in 2,500 tier 1 retail locations nationwide, including Publix, Sam’s Club, a division of Walmart, Albertsons Companies and Tops Markets. ', \"On another subject, I briefly spoke about our new hire Allan Sabatier back in April. Allan was brought on as our Vice President of Business Development and has been busy ever since. With a number of key contacts made from the recent IDDBA show in New Orleans Allen's been working closely with our friends north of the board room. \", 'Canada is showing great signs of progress and is a region we can obtain very favorable pricing for our products. Samples continue to be sent to customers in Canada and the initial feedback has been very positive. We will provide further updates on these efforts throughout the year. Allen also continues to focus his efforts on chain restaurants, convenience stores, of which we will be in the next couple of weeks working at NACS or National Association of Convenience Store show, College University as he continues to work with corporate commissaries, casinos and food service distributors. ', 'While all these large prospects tend to move slowly relative to grocery stores, each win on this front will be incredibly impactful for us. ', 'Collectively we have our manufacturing expansion complete - with the manufacturing expansion completed and the new products hitting in the shelves, we now have the capacity and breadth of products to compete in this segment and to aggregate additional market share. ', 'So, at this point I would like to turn the call back over to Carl for some final notes before wrapping up with some Q&A. Carl. ', 'Carl Wolf', 'Thank you, Larry and Matt. As I noted in my opening remarks, we’ve really laid the groundwork for the strong remainder of fiscal 2020. As we gear up for growth, we’ve continued to implement a comprehensive marketing strategy which we are very pleased with today. We set the stage for an incredible fiscal 2020, and I look forward to continue operational execution and shareholder value creation over the long term. ', 'With that, I will turn it over to the operator. Operator. ', 'Question-and-Answer Session ', 'Operator', 'Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Howard Halpern with Taglich Brothers. Please go ahead. ', 'Howard Halpern', 'Congratulations guys. Great quarter. ', 'Carl Wolf', 'Thank you. ', 'Howard Halpern', 'In terms of the growth that you had in this quarter, the $2.5 million increase in sales revenue. Could you break that down between you know new customers, your largest customers and I guess maybe that, the event that you had? ', 'Carl Wolf', \"The merchandising event was less than 5% of total sales. The new customers, existing customers had a - new product and existing customers had a great extent of the new business in the quarter. New customers started ramping-up in the quarter and now are going into this quarter as we announced. Some of them are existing customers and there will be what we found is much more prudent to do is to announce new customers when we shipped, and not announce when we expect to ship, because often it's pushed back over the few cases it doesn't happen or it's a different number of items or different placements. \", \"So we hope in the very near future to make significant additional announcements. We also like to make announcements where we group the customers together, which very often customers don't like you to use their name. \", 'Howard Halpern', 'Okay. In terms of I guess now you know the recent announcement, you know the over 2,500 grocery retail locations. What does that brings your total number up to approximately in retail locations across the U.S.? ', 'Carl Wolf', \"We’re still sticking with the 45,000 even though it's increased, because the key is the type of locations. So if you get into a club store the volume can be 30x higher than a traditional supermarket. So our mix is changing to higher volume locations with larger customers. So we're staying with the 45,000, and I'm not sure that’s a totally – what I’m trying to say is not a totally meaningful number. \", 'Howard Halpern', \"Okay. And so in terms of the potential growth from that 2,500, what type of lead time, you know customer acceptance time? Is it a quarter or two quarters before you'll get a feel of whether that you'll have a you know that additional location added to it. \", 'Carl Wolf', \"No, no that’s. We’re [inaudible] we announced that it's only ships; we shipped to each of those customers or in a merchandising program. We haven't announced any proposed ships, so these are actual results. \", 'Howard Halpern', 'Okay, now on - I guess a little bit on the [indiscernible], because I could see the Q out there. In postage and freight, was the increase in the quarter more one time or is this going to be the new level approximately of increase for the next quarter or two. I think it was close to 300,000. ', 'Carl Wolf', \"Well, the sales went up very substantial as part of it and postage and freight will go up with more sales. You don't necessarily get a tremendous savings for freight as a percentage of sales as we are pretty efficient. \", 'We did have a few customers where freight ran much higher than we would have liked and we have in this quarter figured out a way to [indiscernible] save a lot of money for the company. So freight should be much more in line. ', 'Howard Halpern', \"Okay, and could you talk about a little bit more about [indiscernible], okay, talk a little bit more about you know I guess your R&D in terms of new products. I know you've recently added pasta bowls and Meatball Pie and such, but are there any new items that would be – should be looking for either by the end of this year or into next fiscal year. \", 'Carl Wolf', 'We have mentioned before that we are working on a plant based product and as soon as we have definitive information we will – again, not something that would be proposed, it’s something that would be real, not that we plan to make an announcement or we plan to go into that, we think there’s not a prudent way.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\", 'At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Steve Sadler, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, Mr. Sadler.', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Good morning. I'm here today with Vince Mifsud, Global President; Doug Bryson, VP, Finance; and Todd May, VP, Legal Counsel. Before we begin, I’ll have Todd read our forward disclaimer.\", 'Todd May', \"Certain statements made may be forward-looking. By their nature, such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those in Enghouse's continuous disclosure filing such as its AIF, which could cause the Company's actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or expectations.\", 'Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements and the Company has no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.', 'Stephen Sadler', 'Thanks, Todd. Doug will now give an overview of the financial results.', 'Douglas Bryson', 'Thanks, Steve. Yesterday, Enghouse announced its unaudited third quarter financial results for the period ended July 31, 2019. Third quarter revenue was $101.3 million, a 16.8% increase compared to revenue of $86.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The revenue increase primarily reflects contributions from acquisitions.', \"Results from operating activities were $27 million, compared to $26.7 million in the prior year's third quarter, which reflects the impact of changes in product mix on gross margin and as expected, lower operating margin contributions from acquisition in their initial period after acquisition. Net income for the quarter was $14.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share with increased amortization and a foreign exchange loss.\", 'Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $28.1 million or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $27.4 million or $0.50 per diluted share last year, with the increase being attributable to incremental revenue contributions from acquisitions. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was $276.5 million, compared to revenue of $257 million in the prior year.', 'Results from operating activities were $79.4 million compared to $75.9 million in the prior year-to-date, an increase of 4.7%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA was $81.6 million or $1.48 per diluted share compared to $78.1 million or $1.43 per diluted share last year.', \"Operating expenses before special charges related to restructuring of acquired operations were $42 million, compared to $34.1 million in the prior year's third quarter and reflect incremental operating costs related to recent acquisitions.\", \"Non-cash amortization charges on acquired software and customer relationships from acquired operations were $8.5 million for the quarter compared to $7.2 million in the prior year's third quarter.\", 'The Company generated cash flows from operating activities of $13.9 million compared to $29.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. On a year-to-date basis, cash flows from operating activities were $59.6 million. This relates to unfavorable working capital adjustments from new acquisitions which, when acquired had severance obligations and significant payable balances that have since been settled.', 'Enghouse closed the quarter with $141.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, compared to $193.9 million at October 31, 2018. The cash balance was achieved after payments of $15.8 million for cash dividends and $94.2 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions concluded in the current fiscal year and $1.1 million for acquisitions closed in prior years.', 'During the quarter, Enghouse completed the acquisitions of Vidyo Inc. and Espial Group Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $68.7 million, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions reported revenue consistent with expectations and were accretive to earnings in the quarter.', \"Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved the Company's eligible quarterly dividend of $0.11 per common share, payable on November 29, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2019.\", \"I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Sadler.\", 'Stephen Sadler', 'Thank you, Doug. As Doug noted, we closed the quarter with $141.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after spending $68.7 million net of cash acquired on acquisitions.', 'Cash flow before changes in working capital was $28.5 million and $13.9 million from operating activities. The difference is mainly working capital, which reflects payment of liabilities and restructuring as Doug mentioned, which was implemented just prior to our acquisition of Vidyo and Espial.', 'Revenue as expected, other than for our Asset Management division, which had some revenue delayed to Q4. We expect revenue to increase in Q4 and to improve EBITDA profitability over Q3 as a result of recognizing the delayed AMG revenue and recognition of a full quarter of revenue and EBITDA from recent acquisitions.', \"It's also noted that foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue compared to Q2 by $1.1 million and cost was positively impacted by $500,000 and compared to last year, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue by $1.5 million and $1 million positive for operating costs, compared again to Q3 of 2018.\", 'In terms of acquisitions, as noted on our last quarterly call, we purchased in May, Vidyo and Espial with an objective to be EBITDA positive on these acquisitions, but not achieve our normal EBITDA margins in the first two quarters. We are happy to report excluding purchase price adjustments both acquisitions were profitable in Q3.', 'Espial had limited profitability as we need to continue to invest in IPTV, where although we have interested customers, we do not anticipate revenue until Q2 2020. Vidyo had profitable results in Q3 due to restructuring done just before the acquisition was completed and some additional restructuring has been done since the acquisition.', 'We expect both revenue and operating income will improve further in Q4, when a full quarter is recognized in our financial results. For Vidyo, we intend to invest in improving revenue on a global basis next fiscal year 2020 and therefore, will require some investment from our increased profitability.', 'It is very satisfying that both these businesses were brought to a positive EBITDA position in Q3 since as a business they had substantial losses for many years prior to their acquisition. We hope to build on this success.', 'Economic and market conditions in our service industries continue to be favorable for acquisition strategy and meeting our acquisition financial payback criteria with a strong return on invested capital. We continue to focus on our capital deployment activities as well as positioning to improve internal growth in future years. Our integration of both Vidyo and Espial is substantially complete.', 'I would now like to open the call for questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephanie Price of CIBC. Please go ahead.', 'Stephanie Price', 'Good morning.', 'Stephen Sadler', 'Hey, Stephanie.', 'Stephanie Price', 'I wonder if you could expand a little bit on the Asset Management division in the quarter. You mentioned some delayed revenue. Wondering if this – it has since closed?', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. I mean, we expect it to close soon. As I've stated in the past, sometimes the Asset Management Group, which has larger deals can be a little lumpy from one quarter to another, and we tend to look at it on a yearly basis, and it's done pretty good year-to-date, but there was a couple of deals that have moved to Q4.\", \"So when you look at our Asset Management Group, you'll find its revenue. In my opinion, isn't as good as it should have been, but it's not from the acquisitions, it's from – it's basically from these delayed revenue being recognized.\", 'Stephanie Price', 'Great. And then in terms of Espial, can you talk a little bit about this IPTV opportunity that you see going into next year?', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. IPTV is an upcoming item. They're very good on the cable side, but they didn't really have a completed IPTV for software package to provide, so we're working on that, and that will really – no revenue from it yet. But we do expect by early next year that we will have some revenue, and we already have interested customers, i.e. they've committed that they would like to take it. But of course, you can't recognize revenue until you give it to all.\", 'Stephanie Price', 'Fair enough. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. Please go ahead.', 'Paul Steep', \"Hey, good morning. Steve or Vince, maybe you could talk a little bit about the DemandGen initiatives. I guess, we've been a year into it. We are not looking for forward forecast. But talk about some of the trends you've seen in lead flow. And I know you've invested more going mark-to-market directly. What have you seen in terms of the conversion there? And maybe what are some of the future opportunities?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"I'll let Vince take that one.\", 'Vincent Mifsud', \"Okay. Different divisions are at different stages on the DemandGen side, but generally speaking, the interactive group is progressing well on DemandGen. We're seeing good bookings and you're seeing it translate into results.\", \"And then on the network side, again, that's pretty new on DemandGen. We have more opportunity there. I think it's in the area of cross-selling and we've got a lot of products, a great customer base, so we hope to see more progress there in the next few quarters.\", 'Paul Steep', \"Okay. And I guess, Steve, on the M&A side, it looks like you're trying to hire some additional resources. Maybe talk about where you're at in terms of team size as well as what the pipeline looks like in terms of just coverage and growth now that you've had like you said, two or three quarters of having some extra resources on that file?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. I'm not sure we are adding a lot of resources. I think we're looking to hire one person to do outbound calling, and otherwise it's a pretty stable group, a good group that been a lot of the time on acquisitions. It's also integrating them into our current operation, but other than looking for one person, really no change there. It's a pretty solid group.\", 'Paul Steep', 'Great. And then just one last clarification for me. How much revenues from acquisitions in the quarter, Steve?', 'Stephen Sadler', 'About $14 million.', 'Paul Steep', 'Perfect. Thanks guys.', 'Stephen Sadler', 'Again, the acquisitions were okay. I was hoping for a little more revenue, but the Asset Management side is down a little bit from our networks delayed revenue.', 'Paul Steep', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Deepak Kaushal of GMP Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of follow-ups and a couple of minor ones. Steve, just on this AMG delay, have you guys started delivering the product and you just can't build for revenues. Is this some sort of unbuild revenue here? Or it is – is there everything kind of on hold?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Generally, you deliver it with larger accounts. Sometimes, it takes a little longer than we would expect to get all the sign-offs and therefore, get the PO to record the revenue. So we do – it isn't like we're looking for the revenue. We have some interested prospects ready to go, but it takes time to get all the approvals done and we haven't got them done yet. So there's still some risk in that quarter to get them done, but I expect that we will improve the revenue there.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', 'Okay. And on the cash drag, I know you said the integration is done on the acquisitions, but on the cash drag from that, is that now complete? Or should you get back to normal run rate going forward here?', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. We should be hopefully better than normal run rate. So again, the two companies had a lot of losses and had some financial issues. We had to pay a lot of fees and straighten some stuff up. That's all being done. So we should be back to a normal run rate in Q4.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Okay. And then, I think, I saw mention of a higher hardware mix. Is that a temporary thing? Is there a trend going on? Or is it from the acquisitions? Maybe you can shed some light on that and how that should trend? And then I've got a more interesting questions, perhaps.\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. I do expect the hardware side has picked up a little bit. Vidyo had some hardware come in with it, because they – to do Vidyo, there's hardware involved as well and they are like one-stop shopping. So the hardware mix, there will be a little bit more hardware. If you start doing the percentage though, I would think the other parts of our revenue mix will also improve. So mate, I don't think the percentage will go up, but as an absolute dollar thing, I do think you'll have a little higher hardware mix.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on, I think earlier in your comments, you mentioned investing in global revenue with Vidyo. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the go-to-market strategy for Vidyo globally. And if you might be able to get synergies between Vidyo on the enterprise side with your contact center side of your business? Just a bit more on the strategy and how you grow that business?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"There's a couple of questions there. Our objective in the quarter was, let's get it to profitability, let's generate cash flow. And once we got it stabilized, then how do we invest some of that cash flow to build the business. If you look in our current contact center, we do service some of our competitors because the products are very secure and good in that area. So again, yes, we hope to build that into our own systems as well.\", 'But outside that, remember one of the great advantages we have is we have a global structure with people in many countries. So we want to take the product. Again, we want to get some of the issues cleaned up first, but we want to take the product, adding a few people in those countries to each of those countries and therefore, expand the product globally, which they did not really have that many people in other countries where we have 50 plus in many countries as you know.', \"So we're going to try and use our global structure to see if we can sell more the Vidyo in those countries. If you look at what's happening today, everyone's putting a bubble over themselves in countries. The best example is the U.S. So again, once we can show we have people in the country, supporting the software in the country, we believe that's an advantage that we should see results from in the future. So that's our intention, but we want the software really solid before we do that expansion, and we're working on that now.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', 'Okay. And so the investments for both Vidyo and Espial, should they be done by Q2 next year or would they just be ongoing as part of the normal course of business?', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Espial, it's clear now.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Yes. But you're investing in both of them, right, as you mentioned.\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes, but the Espials is going now in R&D to actually get the product ready for market by early next year. For Vidyo, we would have to add, what I'll say, call DemandGen sales and marketing in our other countries. Probably that will start November to December with results next calendar year.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', 'Okay.', 'Stephen Sadler', \"We're going to – we'll have more budget process now to see how to do this and now – probably get sorted out. But you do have to hire people, you do have to set up. So my guess is that will be done not by the end of October, but by the end of December and results starting in next year if it's successful, which we hope it will be.\", 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Okay. And so put it in a different way then the target to get back to corporate average margins for both of these companies. Can we say that's the end of 2020? Or does it stretch out beyond that?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"I'd say I was going to start first quarter of 2020, starting November 1. Because all these things, remember, if I'm doing the Vidyo, it shouldn't cost that much more, maybe we can use some of our current resources to do it. So that's okay.\", 'And the IPTV should be bringing in some more revenue again in the second quarter of next year, but I also have those delayed results. Our margin should have been better this quarter. So I expect Q4 will be better, never mind next year.', 'Deepak Kaushal', \"Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Thanks very much. I'll pass the line.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Paul Treiber', 'Thanks very much, and good morning. Just in regards to Vidyo, in terms of product portfolio, my understanding is that they have several different platforms. Is there a strategy to support all of them going forward or will you prioritize some over the others?', 'Stephen Sadler', \"Well, we actually have three main areas that they're in. They do hospitals and financial institutions, which are vertical markets. They've enterprise, which is a more general. And they have sort of a platform IO to let people write programs on and use the basic fundamentals of the platform.\", \"They were doing a new system as well. And we've actually curtailed that and decided to improve their current one rather than keep developing the new ones. So we're trying to put more resource on the current one to build faster versus splitting the platforms up. So it's not really a wide variety of platforms right now the way we positioned it.\", 'Paul Treiber', \"Okay. And I assume based on your prior comment about taking it globally the ones that you're investing in, I assume you believe would be scalable into other geographic markets.\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Yes. I believe that to be true. And in long run investing and you should also understand is both in the cloud and on premise. They were trying to just build in the cloud type system. The one we have with some improvements can do both. So we think that's an advantage, and we just got to clean it up a bit, put a little more investment in it because they had stopped investment for a couple of years and we have to catch that back up if we're going to go that route. So we're working on that now and probably will have some more resource working on that rather than dividing the resource up into two parts.\", 'Paul Treiber', \"And then just broadly in terms of the R&D strategy and also the competitive environment. In the past, like a couple years ago, you characterized your R&D spending as industry leading. And then since then it's come down a bit, it sounds like you maybe going through a little bit more of a cycle here where the R&D spending maybe a bit higher.\", \"How do you see – what's in priority for R&D? Do you see that as a competitive differentiator at this point? And then related to that, the competitive environment there's been a concerns for the last couple of years about the cloud competitors and whatnot. Could you provide an update on the competitive environment and how you see these new acquisitions fitting in there?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"Okay. So you have a couple of questions there that aren't all related. But let me do the R&D side first. If you look at this quarter and look at the R&D spend to revenue, generally we’re running previously around 14%, you'll note this has jumped up to 16% plus. So that R&D spend is already in the quarter with the two new acquisitions, which I already explained why it's there. \", \"Over time, that percentage should come down hopefully because we have more revenue. So if you have – the costs are okay, maybe up a little bit, but hopefully revenues up more. So we've already done that part.\", \"From the competitive side, it's pretty much the same. Different divisions have different competitors, but the SaaS side on the contact center still there, has been for a while. The part that we hope to bring out soon as well is our team's integration.\", \"And again, we see that coming by let's say the end of the calendar year. We're making good progress there. That should improve some of our issues we've had over the last 18 months with our Microsoft, Skype for Business operation. So yes, a lot of things are being positioned and hopefully coming together for a good next year.\", 'Paul Treiber', \"And maybe, what would tie my couple of questions together is, from a competitive perspective, do you see the investments that you're making in the product would either close the competitive gap or extend your lead versus competitors? Or do you think more is needed there? Or do you think it's sufficient where it is?\", 'Stephen Sadler', \"We think they're all pretty much a commodity in some way, some might do some things better than others. So you can't do everything for everybody. Right now in the two products, the IPTV, it's important to get that done. That would be new.\", \"In the Vidyo side, they're pretty good with their system that they have, but we have to clean it up. We want to make it more stable, clean up any issues that might have and make it really robust, so anyone using it can do it without any issues. So that's more of, I'll call it, a bug cleanup versus trying to do a lot of new things in there because it's pretty competitive as it is today.\", \"It's secure. It’s done some interesting things compared to competitors who are getting better traction in the market like Zoom. We believe our software is more secure than theirs and we are quite competitive already, but we have to catch up a little bit from the getting the software more robust and cleaned up because they've fallen a little bit behind in the last couple of years.\", 'Paul Treiber', 'Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] There are no questions in the telephone queue at this time.', 'Stephen Sadler', 'Okay. Thank you, everyone for your continued interest in Enghouse.

Following management discussion, there will be a formal Q&A session open to participants on the call.\", \"And now I would like to turn the conference call over to Jim Gaynor, LightPath's President and Chief Executive Officer. Jim, please go ahead.\", 'Jim Gaynor', \"Thank you and good morning. Welcome to LightPath Technologies' fiscal 2019 fourth quarter financial results conference call. Our financial results press release was issued after the market closed yesterday and posted to our corporate website. Following my remarks, our CFO, Don Retreage, will further review our financial results and provide more perspective on some key areas. We will then conduct a Q&A session and move on from there.\", 'LightPath experienced encouraging progress on many fronts during 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30, which were unfortunately masked by a few critical issues. The key takeaway is that the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of visible and infrared lenses is on the rise. Here is the backdrop.', 'We essentially have two primary sides of our business, precision molded lenses or PMO products is our legacy business which is slower growing and smaller than our infrared or IR business. The PMO addressable market is estimated at about $300 million, growing at about 3% to 5% annually. The IR addressable market is estimated at greater than $500 million, growing at about 7% to 10% annually. Each of these markets is impacted by seasonality and cyclicality. Third line of business falls outside both of these areas and is for specialty products and other projects which will have varying contributions to our consolidated financial results, typically 3% to 10% of total revenues.', 'Fiscal 2019 revenue growth of IR was 8% and PMO was 4%. In the fourth quarter, revenue growth for IR accelerated with an increase of 19% while PMO growth was steady at 4%. On top of that, our 12-month backlog was $17.1 million at June 30, 2019, an increase of 33% as compared to $12.8 million at June 30, 2018. While these metrics were positive, they were not as high as we had expected. 2019 may be best characterized as transitional.', 'Specifically, here are some of the challenges and opportunities that our transition has addressed. The closure of our New York facilities, balancing demand generation and fulfillment capacity, cost structure issues for margin and profitability enhancements, the impact of tariffs resulting from the U.S.-China trade war, and a non-cash tax and other charges taken to effectively clear house as we go into fiscal 2020.', 'I will now address the first three areas to provide some context, and Don will address the tariffs and charges in his remarks. First, the closure of our New York facilities in Irvington was undertaken as we believe we would not be able to expand capacity in this facility to meet additional IR volume growth that we anticipate and certainly not set up to be able to supply defense IR opportunities. The cost of $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, $845,000 in the fourth quarter is expected to be more than offset with savings of at least an equal amount in fiscal 2020.', 'With the functions and capacities primarily moved to Orlando, we are now positioned for more IR volume and to handle U.S. defense IR business. The New York move plays into our effort of balancing demand generation and fulfillment capacity. As previously disclosed, our increased order backlog is aligned with our operating objective of entering new fiscal quarters with at least 75% of capacity accounted for by our forecasted revenue. So, as our manufacturing capacity increases, we would be able to increase our revenue production.', 'In looking back, when the PMO business was the majority of our forecast, we could book and ship these products within the quarter while most IR products cannot be turned that quickly. Thus we have focused on ways in which to reduce the delivery cycle time for our infrared products. While we are addressing this with the conversion of certain of these infrared products from diamond turned traditional infrared materials to molded BD6. We continue to implement cost reductions in our manufacturing process while simultaneously addressing our sales execution efficiency. The sales focus will be addressed in my comments in a few minutes.', 'And in terms of shortening our process cycle times, we are making good progress as we continue to invest in capacity and capabilities in all our factories. Investments in systems and people are aimed at speeding our quote response time and fully integrating our capabilities between our global factories. With the increasing acceptance of our new BD6 glass product line, we have expanded our glass melting and coating capabilities in Orlando, expanded our coating and glass preparation capacity in China and improved our test and measurement capabilities in all of the factories.', 'With the completion of our relocation of our New York facility to Orlando in June, we expect a significant reduction in operating costs in our fiscal 2020 that began July 1. On the visible PMO product lines, the work we did in 2018 on new designs for the telecom sector are moving into production. Several new designs went into production beginning in the middle of 2019. We have a number of new designs going forward for telecom alone, which experienced a 30% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter and 60% for the year.', 'The largest area of growth in telecom is related to the 5G movement. Regardless of which OEM has the leading market share or which country invests more in capital expenditures for the 5G infrastructure being deployed, LightPath stands to benefit in a big way. This is an example of positioning LightPath at the intersection of our capabilities and the requirements of the market. We believe no other lens manufacturer offers the breadth of winning designs, engineering support for development of new products and global production capabilities for high-volume supply deals providing a competitive value proposition of performance and price.', \"To this end, towards the beginning of our fiscal 2019, we announced comprehensive production capabilities and global availability for a new line of infrared lenses made of chalcogenide compound. We developed this glass capability and grew it internally to produce black diamond glass which has been trademarked and marketed as BD6. This lower cost alternative to traditional germanium material used for IR lenses is expected to benefit the cost structure of some of our current infrared products and allow us to expand our product offerings in response to the market's increasing requirement for low-cost infrared optics solutions.\", 'The interest in BD6 lenses has been incredibly gratifying. During fiscal 2019, we created 16 new lenses using BD6 and solidified 14 new design wins. At the Defense and Commercial Sensing tradeshow last April, we introduced several new IR lens assembly products for which we are now experiencing really good feedback and order interest. Since then, we have developed an entire family of lens assemblies ranging from 1.5 millimeter to 50-millimeter focal lengths. For the past several months, we have been ramping up production for end market applications that include rifle scopes, range finders, sensory equipment, wearable devices for first responders and more.', 'Since the beginning of fiscal 2019 to-date, we have moved 10 BD6 IR lenses into production. This progress is truly impressive. Let me put this into more appropriate context. Responding to the high price of raw material that was eating away at our gross margin, in about 18 months we created a new family of lenses, launched a global marketing campaign, invested in a new manufacturing plant, and entered into high-volume production and delivery.', 'Importantly, a significant portion of this new lines of lenses is able to be molded which will enable us to move faster from order placement to revenue recognition while further improving our margins beyond the cost of materials. As a reminder, in general most BD6 lenses are about 25% to 30% less expensive on 40% to 50% of the material component of the lens as compared to comparable lenses made of germanium. As we continue to convert lenses that are currently made out of germanium to BD6, we will see benefit there.', 'On the molding of BD6 lenses, the growth rates, albeit of a small base, has been off the charts. IR molded grew 159% for fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018 and 364% in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018. And by the way, it was 108% for the third quarter of 2019 versus the third quarter of 2018, all of which demonstrates that our growth has accelerated as the year progressed.', 'Based on our improved competitive position globally and our large backlog as well as the interest in our diversified product lines, investments are being made to add capacity with IR production increases as the key focus. Capital expenditures including equipment purchased through capital leases were $2.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, compared to $3.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The heavier period of investment is behind us however, so we anticipate improved free cash flow as our order flow increases and we move into production at a faster rate.', 'To ensure continued progress and long term success, another key initiative in fiscal 2019 was centered on the organization and its leadership. Just before the start of the fiscal year, we upgraded our finance department with the appointment of Donald Retreage as CFO. In June, we announced the succession plan which involves the search for a CEO to assume the role upon my retirement in 2020. The executive search is exploring both internal and external candidates. To ensure LightPath can proactively take maximum advantage of its capabilities and grow at our desired rates with our more complex and broader product portfolio, we have taken further actions to strengthen the organization. We created the position of Chief Operating Officer to better match supply with demand by combining operations, engineering and sales under a single leader. Al Symmons has been appointed to this position who is an industry veteran including 13 years with LightPath.', 'LightPath has three distinct product capabilities, molded optics, thermal imaging lens assemblies and custom optics. Each of these capabilities involves products that have different growth rates, conversion rates and material content. To manage these different revenue streams, we have also implemented and staffed a product management function. The role of product managers is to manage each product portfolio and target the most probable high-growth opportunities that align with our capabilities.', \"LightPath's vision is to be the most competitive supplier of optical lenses that will ultimately enhance stockholder value. Our strategy going forward is to position LightPath at the intersection of our unique capabilities and the optical lens requirements of our target industries with the shortest time to market.\", 'In summary, meaningful progress has been made in fiscal 2019 as well as in fiscal 2020 to-date toward our initiatives for delivering sustainable improvements in long-term revenue performance, profitability and cash flow. We look forward to realizing the full benefits of the actions taken last year and in the new fiscal year that began on July 1, 2019.', 'I will now pass the call back to CFO, Donald Retreage, to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full-year financial results.', 'Donald Retreage', 'Thank you Jim. First, I would like to mention that much of the information we are discussing during this call is also included in the press release issued yesterday and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. I encourage you to visit our website at lightpath.com and specifically the section titled Investor Relations.', 'Now onto my remarks pertaining to the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Rather than recite all of the financial details in the press release, I will review some of the highlights and then address the items Jim has referenced in his remarks. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was $8.7 million, an increase of 8% as compared to $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Revenue for the full year was $33.7 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of 4% as compared to $32.5 million in fiscal 2018.', 'For our geographic revenue mix in the fourth quarter, we had 39% from North America, 24% from Asia, 34% from Europe and 2% from the rest of the world. For the year, 38% was from North America, 23% from Asia, 36% from Europe and 4% from the rest of the world.', 'Now onto our vertical markets sales review for the first quarter. Sales to catalogs and distributors were 18% of revenue, defense was 14%, industrial was 40%, commercial was 10%, medical was 4% of the total revenue, telecom was 15%. The 12-month was $17.1 million at June 30, 2019 and increased 33% as compared to $12.8 million at June 30, 2018. In addition, we have an undisclosed backlog that goes out from months 13 to 36 which together with our 12-months backlog provides us with enhanced visibility to manage the business and invest according to future manufacturing capacity needs.', \"Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was $1.8 million compared to a net loss of $807,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2019 period includes nonrecurring charges of $845,000 relating to the transition out of New York, a non-cash reversal of $406,000 of income tax benefits recorded in the first half of fiscal 2019. this was due to a change in the company's estimated utilization of net operating loss carryforward benefits for fiscal 2019.\", 'We incurred EBITDA losses in fourth quarter of both 2019 and 2018 in the amounts in excess of $200,000 for each period. Total 2019 EBITDA was $1.9 million as compared with $4 million for all of 2018. EBITDA, as reported for fiscal 2019, was 6% of revenue. If we adjust it for nonrecurring cost related to relocation of New York facilities as mentioned above, EBITDA would have been 10% of revenue. If we further consider the cost improvements we expect from the relocation, quoting improvements and material cost saving we procure from our vendors, we believe our EBITDA would have been in the range of 12% to 15% of revenue which compares with 12% of EBITDA margin for all of 2018.', 'Total debt, including capital leases, was $6.6 million at June 30, 2019, a decrease of 11% as compared to $7.4 million at June 30, 2018. Cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 million at June 30, 2019, compared to $6.5 million at June 30, 2018. The decrease in cash of $1.5 million or 29% from the prior year end is primarily related to capital expenditures, debt reduction and inventory build. With a higher backlog and anticipated revenue, we increased the amount of inventory being carried from the beginning of the year. In anticipation of the increased IR business, BD6 and GE, we increased the inventory by approximately $1.3 million to $7.6 million.', 'Moving on to other areas that Jim referenced and the impact of tariffs resulting from the U.S.-China trade war, it should be understood that not all our products are subject to tariffs. About 64% of our consolidated business is international, which does not have to come through the U.S. and our China facilities only exports 55% of its output. That being said, in fiscal 2019, the company paid approximately $940,000 in tariffs. This represents an increase of $400,000 of tariffs paid in 2018, of which $175,000 was incurred in the fourth quarter due to rate increases that took effect during the quarter.', \"We have taken several actions that will mitigate most of the impact of these tariffs starting in Q2 2020 or the quarter beginning October 1, 2019. We have increased some inventories in country so that the impact would be limited for a while and we are taking advantage of these and other mitigating steps including where we limit some of things that we ship through the U.S. and may even put a surcharge on certain items where we don't have international latitude.\", \"In the fourth quarter, we took charges to restructure expenses for the reversal of non-cash income tax benefit. The charges included nonrecurring charges $845,000 related to the transition out of New York and non-cash reversal of $406,000 income tax benefit recorded in the first half of the fiscal 2019, again due to changes in the company's estimated utilization of net operating loss carryforward benefits for 2019. A large part of the restructure is to accrue for the remaining rents in the New York facilities. Should we be able to sublet the real estate, we will recapture the cash income. The facility consolidation and other previously announced organizational changes are expected to allow for investments in marketing and product management to further grow our revenue base, while still reducing total operating costs and expenses. Our remaining NOL, net operating loss, as of June 30, 2019 were $74 million.\", 'With this review of our financial highlights concluded, I will turn back to the operator so that we may begin with our question-and-answer session. Thank you.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Marc Wiesenberger with B. Riley FBR.', 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'Thank you. Good morning.', 'Jim Gaynor', \"Well, good morning to you, Marc. It's early morning there.\", 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'It is. Can you walk me through your thinking on gross margins over the coming year and some of the puts and takes that are going to go into that?', 'Jim Gaynor', 'Well, sure. I think the gross margins and the cost of goods sold were impacted in 2019 by some of these restructure charges and a few other costs that are nonrecurring as well as some redundant labor that we had while we were moving that operation. So, we expect those things, that margin to improve dramatically in fiscal 2020 as we start to take advantage of these programs that we put in place last year. So, I think we will see a significant improvement in the margins as we move forward, and you have already started to see it in the current quarters.', 'If you look back, we went from 30% to 32%, and you know, as we do some of this conversion, you are going to see some improvements as we start to take advantage of the BD6 benefits over germanium costs and those kinds of things moving forward. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think maybe a better metric to consider is how the EBITDAs will change. We reported a 6% EBITDA this year as reported.', \"If you adjusted that for just the cost of the relocation and the redundant labor we had, that would move to 10%. And then if you start to put in some of the cost savings that we expect to see -- that we have already put in place, but the benefits haven't fully flown through the financials yet, then we would move that EBITDA into the range of 12% to 15% and then we continue to go from there.\", \"So that's without any volume changes whatsoever. If you start to grow the business as we expect, then I think you will see the EBITDAs return into the margins that we would like to see into the 20s more than likely as we move forward over the next year or two.\", 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'Got it. And expanding on our last one a little bit. How do we think about the potential growth of the business now that some of the moving pieces have been resolved?', 'Jim Gaynor', \"Well, I think as we said, these markets are growing at a compounded annual rate of 7% to 8%, particularly I mean for the infrared business and about 3% to 5% for the PMO business. We think the visible business is going to be pretty stable at that kind of growth rate. It's going to be driven by the 5G demand. So, we see that continuing. The IR, I think, we will see growing at much faster rate, probably double that at a minimum.\", 'We saw some acceleration of that growth rate in the fourth quarter where we had 19% growth. You also saw some very good growth of the molded IR as that starts to pick up steam. So I think we would see that kind of growth there. The specialty business is kind of up and down, depending of what kind of projects that we are able to become involved in. But I would expect that to stay in the range that it typically runs around 6% of our revenue.', 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'Understood. Can you talk about some of the dynamics with regards to the strength in telecom and industrial maybe and then offset by the weakness in the commercial vertical? And how we should think about that going forward?', 'Jim Gaynor', \"Well, I think, obviously, our focus has been on the infrared sector which is where we think we see the fastest growth. So, I think that's going to continue. I think the telecom business, being driven by 5G is the main driver of that. We did a lot of work in 2018 developing and designing lenses for that application for our customers there, and those are starting to move in production. So, I think we will see that. I don't see that backing off.\", \"That's one of the areas that has the potential to be impacted, in our case, by what's going on with the relation of the tariffs with China. But a lot of that business is built in China and sold in China, so it's not heavily impacted there. But I think that's going to continue to drive that business. That's the main driver there.\", 'The types of applications in the infrared that we are doing with riflescopes and sensors and those kinds of things, I think are going to drive the business in the infrared and particularly some of the things that we like are the smaller-type lenses because those are all moldable for us. We have moved these processes around.', 'We have brought the coating processes in-house and developed wear-resistant coatings for both the capabilities for LightPath, anyway for germanium and also for the BD6. So, I think that will help accelerate that conversion to the chalcogenide material system. So those are all things that I think are going to drive the business as we go forward.', 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'Okay. Also, you noted a shortfall of customers. Just crystallize a little more how some of the operational changes you are making will help improve that going forward?', 'Jim Gaynor', \"Yes. I think one of the issues that we faced last year was demand generation. And by that, we mean although we grew, we didn't grow at the expected rates that we would like and part of that was impacted by the relocation of the New York operation and bringing up the coating operation here in Orlando. It went smoothly until the last three or four months and then we had some struggles with it, which we have gotten through, but it impacted the rate and pace with which we could take on new projects.\", \"We also had this communication problem between some of our functional groups as well as our geographic groups as we made this transition. And one of the things that we are trying to address that, that communication issue really slowed down the quoting process and so we weren't able to get quotes out as timely as our customers would like and then we lost some opportunities as a result of that. So what we have tried to do with the organizational changes is address that problem, one, by creating the Chief Operating Officer position so that we consolidate under a single leader the sales, engineering and operations functions and improve that combination and the communication between those groups as well as between the different physical facilities where the various processes reside.\", 'In addition, as I said, we brought the operation up in Orlando to also shorten the lead times and bring up the capabilities that we had. So I think that that kind of thing generates it and then in addition, we created and staffed a product management function. The idea behind that is for the portfolio management. So with the integration of the ISP products and the development of the BD6 and the legacy products, our product portfolio became a lot bigger and a lot more complex.', 'And so what we have now done is try to break it down into these various product groups with a product manager to manage that portfolio and ensure that we are looking at the right types of opportunities, not chasing things that tend to be one-off and go for things that have a little more life to them, bigger opportunities and just manage that process much better. So we are in the beginning stages of that. We have staffed that. Those guys are in place and they are starting to impact that process and make sure that things move through our system more smoothly.', 'So I think that kind of generates that. Also tying together the engineering and operations and sales, now we have a better way of balancing the supply with the demand and make sure that we have the right capacities in place for the right products.', 'Marc Wiesenberger', \"That's helpful. Thank you. And one last one for me. Jim, you have been with LightPath for over 12 years. You have helped expand the product and geographic footprint pretty significantly. But you announced you are going to be stepping down next year. Can you provide with some more details about that transition and maybe the timeline for succession?\", 'Jim Gaynor', 'Yes. I am going to let my boss answer that question. Bob Ripp happens to be here today. So I am going to turn that one over to him.', 'Bob Ripp', 'Good morning Marc. Good morning everybody. With respect to the succession plan, the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, which consists of myself, Louis Leeburg and Sohail Khan, we looked at six different search firms, interviewed three and have an engagement letter with one of them as of now. Each of them that we interviewed were pretty positive about attracting the type of individuals that we would want to lead LightPath. They all were very confident about how quickly they thought they can do it, sometimes in the order of 90 to 100 days.', \"I told them I want right to trump fast in this particular case. But where we stand right now, as we are going through with the search firm that we have engaged through the process of lining up the first round of process to get on with culling from all the applicants that that search firm would be looking at, to a narrower list. And I am sure that within the next two weeks, we will be starting our first interviews. So how long that all will take, based on their forecast, it's about end of year target in their minds. But we will just see how that process goes.\", 'Marc Wiesenberger', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Dyett, a private investor.', 'Michael Dyett', 'Thank you Jim and Bob, good to hear your voice. I wondered if you could expand on the sales strategy concept to the extent to which you will be continuing to use the trade shows versus other initiatives and what the post 12-month backlog has looked like in this current year?', 'Jim Gaynor', \"Well, I think obviously the backlog, let me go there first, is up about 33% over where it was last year. I mean that's the disclosed backlog. So that means that's what's shippable in the next 12 months. It continues. The infrared business is becoming a larger part of our business and that's where we wanted to be. So the reason is that it's a bigger market, it's faster growing. And so that is reflected in that backlog as we move forward. So I think we have a pretty healthy backlog as it stands right now and that's continuing.\", \"I think from a sales process point of view, we are transitioning the sales strategy to a product centric strategy. That's a very technically based process. We put the product managers in place as a way of input into that process to make sure we are looking at the right opportunities as well as to manage that portfolio. I think we have also introduced the concept of capture teams in our sales process, which means that we bring in the right mix, depending on what's the particular opportunity they are looking at, of technical support sales support, operational support. So we form this team to look at the opportunity and develop the quote response and make sure that we have the capabilities in place. We put the right design in place and we have the capacities necessary to execute.\", \"So that's basically the process as we move it forward. So we are in that process. We are also increasing our emphasis on the inside sales, so that this group, the sales group has good support for the back-office type things that are included as well as there is a large portion of our business that can be handled by inside sales that's recurring legacy type business.\", 'Michael Dyett', 'Thank you Jim. And I will say, this is the best conference call I have heard in probably eight or 10 years. Thank you again and good luck.', 'Jim Gaynor', 'All right. Thank you Michael.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And as there are currently no more questions in queue, I would like to return the floor to Jim Gaynor for any closing comments.', 'Jim Gaynor', 'All right. Thank you operator. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. We have covered a lot of detailed information today. So one of the things I would like to do before we close is summarize what I think the key takeaways are. First, our IR business is growing rapidly with the addition of the BD6 material system, our new family of lens assemblies and the release of several new products. Second, our precision molded optics business is stable with growth being driven primarily by 5G demand. Third, we will benefit significantly from the savings generated by the closing of the New York facility. And fourth, we have sufficient cash to fund operational growth through continued investments in product development, manufacturing capacity and the expansion of our customer base.', \"In conclusion, 2019 presented many challenges and some disappointments, which we have addressed and through which we will pave the way for improved financial performance on both the top and bottom lines. We are excited for the future and the continued growth of LightPath. We will also talk more about our strategy and progress at the upcoming Sidoti Conference in New York later this month and I hope to see you there. Thanks again for participating on today's conference call and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\", 'Operator', \"Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

Thank you for joining us today. I’m joined this morning by our President and COO, Adam Kleinman; our CFO, Brent Pearson; and two senior members of our investment team, Adam Yates and John Ehlinger.', 'We will walk through an update on our Operating Companies, Investment Management, Real Estate and General Corporate business segments, as well as their associated financials. Where relevant in our prepared remarks, we will point you to the corresponding slide in the presentation that Adam referenced.', 'Please turn to Slide 5. During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, we reported consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively.', 'Please turn to Slide 6. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we reported consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $51.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively. It’s worth noting that DME only accounts for approximately 10 months of that period, as we acquired those assets in September of 2018.', 'Please turn to Slide 8 to discuss drivers of shareholder value. We have clear objectives in each of our verticals. In Operating Companies, we’re focused on acquiring undercapitalized companies with significant growth potential, both organic and through M&A. In Investment Management, we seek to increase assets under management, both in GECC and in other investment vehicles managed by GECM.', 'In Real Estate, we’re interested in partnering with owners and lessees to utilize our substantial tax assets. On a consolidated basis, our goal is to generate increased free cash flow in fiscal year 2020. We intend to achieve this goal through a continued growth at Great Elm DME and Investment Management enhanced by reduced corporate overhead.', 'Please turn to Slide 9. It is very important for us to maintain long-term alignment with you, our shareholders. Our team collectively owns approximately 2 million shares, or 8% of the company, including our Board of Directors and their funds under management, insiders collectively own 19% of the shares outstanding. We believe this fosters a significant and long-term alignment of interest amongst employees, directors and shareholders.', 'Let’s turn to Slide 11 for an overview of our operating company activity. Recall in September 2018, we acquired Valley Healthcare Group and Northwest Medical collectively Great Elm DME for approximately $64 million, equating to a 4.9 times multiple of LTM pro forma adjusted EBITDA at acquisition.', 'Since acquisition, we’ve been very pleased with the organic growth DME is experiencing. DME generated $12.9 million of revenue and $2.8 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. We’re experiencing meaningful growth in all major product categories and we’re investing heavily in the people, processes and technology to increase the scalability of the DME platform.', 'For example, we’ve successfully consolidated the billing platform and implemented financial management software that will strengthen operations as we scale. Furthermore, we anticipate growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in the forthcoming year, supported by strong KPI performance.', 'Please turn to Slide 12 to discuss our plan for inorganic growth at DME. DME intends to acquire complementary, patient-focused businesses and integrate them into the existing platform. The respiratory-focused durable medical equipment industry is fragmented and ripe for consolidation. DME seeks to pursue an expansion strategy that targets tangential or overlapping markets to our existing geographical footprint in Arizona, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest.', 'In June, a subsidiary of DME acquired the respiratory assets of Midwest Respiratory Care, Inc. for approximately $6.3 million, or 4.6 times Midwest EBITDA less capital expenditure for the 12 months ended April 30, 2019. Midwest integration in the DME is going well and we anticipate that this acquisition will increase DME’s unleveraged free cash flow by approximately $1.4 million in our first year of ownership. In addition, we’re exploring complementary product lines and services that leverage the company’s valuable contracts, referral sources, customer bases and infrastructure.', 'Please turn to Slide 13 to walk through the financial update for our DME segment. Total revenue for the quarter was approximately $12.9 million, as you can see substantially all of DME’s cash flow was invested in rental equipment for new customers. The financial contribution from this new business will primarily come in future quarters.', 'Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $2.8 million, leaving the leverage free cash flow generation of greater than $1.7 million. As adjusted EBITDA continues to grow, we anticipate further growth in free cash flow at DME.', 'Please turn to Slide 15 to discuss the Investment Management vertical. We believe Investment Management is an attractive business for Great Elm due to its scalable business model, high margins and the potential for significant free cash flow generation.', 'In the near-term, we plan to grow our Investment Management business in two ways. First, by opportunistically issuing additional debt at Great Elm Capital Corp., which would increase GECC’s assets and thus, management fees for Great Elm.', 'During the quarter, we issued a new $45 million unsecured note under NASDAQ ticker GECCN. Secondly, we plan to grow our Investment Management business by increasing AUM in other investment vehicles. With significant embedded operating leverage and an established infrastructure, we believe the Investment Management business has the potential to generate substantial free cash flow on a meaningful scale.', 'Turning to Slide 16, management fees increased by greater than 7% quarter-over-quarter. Management fees increased at the fair value of GECC’s diversified portfolio increases. The long-term trend points to continued management fee growth as we deploy capital into both niche indicated leverage credits and potentially specialty finance investments.', 'On Slide 17, we break out the segment financials for Investment Management. Total revenues, which include both management fees and administration fees were approximately $926,000 during the quarter. The full circle consulting fee, which will no longer be charged post November 3, 2019 deducted $183,000 from revenue in the quarter.', 'GECM earned, but did not recognize incentive fees in the amount of $749,000. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $756,000 in the quarter. The positive trend in management fee revenue, coupled with a significant reduction in OpEx in the near future leads us to believe this segment is poised for free cash flow generation.', 'Please turn to Slide 19 to discuss Real Estate. We continue to target credit tenant lease financings and ground lease structures across commercial, government and other property types, taking defined situations in which we can use GEC substantial tax assets and deal structuring expertise to be a value-added partner or lessor.', 'Let’s turn to Slide 20. As you can see on the chart, assuming no appreciation in the property value, GEC’s equity value in the Fort Myers investment will continue to grow between now and the lease expiry in 2030. As cash flows from the rental stream are utilized to amortize debt, equity grows from one times our investment at acquisition to greater than seven times in 2013, all without deploying any additional capital.', 'Turning to Slide 21, let’s walk through the segments financials for Real Estate. During the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $1.3 million in rental income, $64,000 in net income and $1.2 million of EBITDA. While not generating levered free cash flow for Great Elm, as we discussed on the prior slide, we continue to build equity value in this investment through the amortization of debt.', 'On Slide 23, we have a review of Great Elm’s General Corporate segment financial detail. This quarter’s positive net income was primarily driven by an unrealized gain on the investment in GECC shares, dividends from those GECC shares and prudent management of operating expenses.', 'Beyond the financial review on slide 28, we have a summary of how we plan to continue to drive shareholder value. To reiterate, our goal is to generate consolidated free cash flow in fiscal year 2020. We intend to achieve this goal through continued growth in free cash flow at Great Elm DME and Investment Management enhanced by reduced corporate overhead.', 'That concludes our overview of Great Elm’s fiscal fourth quarter. Let’s open up the call for Q&A.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nat Stewart from N.A.S. Capital. Please go ahead.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Hey, how are you guys?', 'Peter Reed', 'Doing well, Nat. How are you?', 'Nat Stewart', 'Good. Yes, I just had a few questions. I saw you mentioned a few times reducing corporate overhead next year. Just curious kind of what specific measures you’re thinking of and what kind of – to what extent a corporate overhead do you think can be reduced?', 'Peter Reed', 'Sure, Nat. So I don’t have specific forward-looking guidance to give on the exact numbers…', 'Nat Stewart', 'Sure.', 'Peter Reed', '…but categorically…', 'Nat Stewart', 'Okay.', 'Peter Reed', '…if you think about this past fiscal year, the DME acquisition was a transformative acquisition for the company. And the downside of that is it did come along with enhanced public company costs, not all of which we expect to be recurring.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Okay.', 'Peter Reed', '[Indiscernible] was unusually expensive as a result of the transformative nature of bringing those two companies into our financials. We don’t expect to have that level of expense in the coming fiscal year. That’s one pretty tangible example of a number of small – there are probably additional smaller public company costs that we’ve substantially already taken actions to reduce, but it’s only partially or not at all flow through our financial statements.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Okay, very good. In terms of acquisitions, you have the great platform with DME. Are there other areas you’re going to be considering looking at it? And how does that compare to what you’re seeing with the asset management segment in terms of growing that area?', 'Peter Reed', 'Sure. So I think that the bar for acquisitions across industries and we are looking at acquisitions across industries is relatively high. We expect to get a high return for our stockholders. One of the things at DME and also an investment management is both of those business segments have established infrastructure, whereby we frequently can’t have the power of buyers’ earnings be higher than the standalone targets earnings.', 'And therefore, those kinds of acquisitions tend to, but not always, hence allowed to having higher financial returns for our stockholders than things in unaffiliated businesses or businesses where we don’t have existing infrastructure. That being said, we’re looking at all sorts of different opportunities and are open-minded about the way in which we create value for our stockholders.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Okay. I noticed that a comment on the Real Estate, you said you’re looking to add value with that one property you had. Is there any additional detail you could talk about that? I don’t know, is there some element of that that’s negotiable? Do you remember, which comment I’m talking about on the slides? It says, maybe there’s some way to add value there. What was that about?', 'Peter Reed', 'Sure. So in this particular case, I think, our property has incremental amount of land that hasn’t been developed. And so from time-to-time, we’ve talked with our tenants about ways in which we could be a partner to them to help them develop or utilize that excess land that is not really being utilized or isn’t being utilized in a way that’s particularly valuable today. That’s one example.', 'Anytime someone is thinking about extending a lease or changing a lease, we have the ability to utilize our NOLs to make that transaction more tax effective for our tenants. And in this, if we can do that and enhance the value for our stockholders by making the proposition a more value-added one for our tenants, we think that’s a great opportunity for win-win transactions.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Okay. Yes, that sounds good. Now in terms of the stock, you guys are still pretty small under the radar. Is there a point at which you think, there are some firms that will do coverage of smaller stocks like this around you’re not quite there yet, but around the $100-plus-million market cap range. Is that something you’ve looked at getting to kind of put the stock on the radar a little bit? Because I think, with DME and the growth, I think, you do have a pretty good growth story. So I certainly think, it would be beneficial to get the word out a little more on the stock?', 'Peter Reed', 'I think we’re open-minded about doing that from sort of DME acquisition. To date, we’ve been sprinting to try to build infrastructure to execute on the growth strategy, in particular, the business needed more infrastructure to be able to be an aggressive acquirer and acquirer of multiple assets per year.', 'That being said, as a lot of that work is being done and we see some of the impacts of that in the quarter and we feel good about the the growth rate there, I think, we’re very open-minded ways to tell our story to a wider audience. And perhaps, we could follow-up offline about any ideas that you heard there.', 'Nat Stewart', 'Sure. Okay. Well, that sounds very good. Keep up the good work. Thanks.', 'Peter Reed', 'Thanks, Nat.', 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jon Old from Long Meadow Investors. Please go ahead.', 'Jon Old', 'Hi, Pete, thanks for the call today. Just curious, given the – obviously, decline in interest rates, where do you stand with contemplating refinancing the DME debt?', 'Peter Reed', 'Hey, Jon, good morning and good question. Certainly, the rate environment is borrower-friendly and certainly part of the deal, when we acquired DME was taking on the particular term loan that we have. The cost of redeeming that go down over time. And you’re right, the opportunity set looks more attractive, not only for saving interest expense on what we have potentially, but also as we think about funding, build out and acquisitions. I think if you look at our debt to EBITDA ratios, we’re relatively underleveraged.', 'So I think that a natural time to seek to refinance that paper, either with our existing lender, who’s been a great partner, by the way, or with another lender is in connection with one or more acquisitions. And so, as we’re sort of always on the hunt, and always in dialogue with acquisitions, that’s never far from the front of our minds in connection with the next step of growing the value of that platform.', 'Jon Old', 'Okay, thanks. So with the respiratory deal, obviously was late in the year. What would you say that sort of the run rate adjusted EBITDA is going into 2020?', 'Peter Reed', 'Our security employers probably don’t want me to give a super precise answer there. But I – what I can say is that the $12.9 million number that we had in public in connection with buying this, coupled with our performance so far, coupled with Midwest makes me think that we are on a – both at an absolute level run rate that’s higher than that and that our growth rate in our key product categories, in particular, has its very optimistic. So the trends lines, not only the absolute level of that, but the trend line growth of that adjusted EBITDA figure.', 'Jon Old', 'Okay. Well, I’m just weird, because the – you talk a lot about the growth and patient growth. And I’m trying to reconcile that with, I mean, the revenues have gone to the $13.2 million, $11.8 million, $12.9 million, EBITDA $3.6 million, $3.2 million, $2.8 million. Do you – I mean, is there a churn on the other side of that, that is not in the numbers or I mean, they doesn’t seem to be that much organic growth relative to the growth in the setups and stuff that you keep talking about, or is it just – is there a lag?', 'Peter Reed', 'Sure. So one of the things I think is useful to remember is the fourth calendar quarter, our second fiscal quarter for most healthcare businesses is by far the seasonally strongest quarter. So the highest revenue number that you referenced within that seasonally strong fourth quarter.', 'Jon Old', 'Okay.', 'Peter Reed', '…that first quarter of the calendar, our third fiscal quarter is typically seasonally your weakest quarter. On top of that, our most important categories path, in particular, are growing very, very rapidly. Other product categories, such as sleep testing, in particular, independent sleep lab testings aren’t growing very quickly. So on a blended average basis, we expect the path, which is our biggest category, as it continues to grow at the rate at which it’s growing, that will – that should increase the overall revenue growth rate that I think you’re referencing.', 'As far as EBITDA goes, we are on purpose investing pretty heavily in people process and infrastructure to be able to execute multiple bolt-on acquisitions a year, like we did with Midwest in the quarter. The process of doing that means that our margins in any particular moment aren’t exactly optimized, and this quarter is a great example of that.', 'I feel really good about the revenue performance. But all of the work that we put into consolidating billing platforms and implementing new software just ends up being a bit distracting. And so the execution on the margin or profitability level is not where I would expect it would be in a quarter in which we weren’t doing all of that activity. We’re not completely done with that activity, but the team has made very good progress. And we feel good about how that’s going and we feel really good about the trend lines in the business.', 'Jon Old', 'Okay.', 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Yates for closing remarks.', 'Adam Yates', 'Thank you, again, for joining us this morning to discuss Great Elm Capital Group’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 financial results. We appreciate your support and we look forward to creating long-term shareholder value together. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if we can be helpful with anything in follow-up, and have a great day.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call.

Good afternoon, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. This is an exciting time for Innate Pharma. This year, we turned 20th full year and we celebrated our 20th anniversary. And I would like to start this call by saying big thank you to our employees, collaborators, partners, physicians, patients and other stakeholders, who have supported our research and development ambition in immuno-oncology over the last 20 years and made this anniversary possible.', 'As you may remember Innate Pharma was at its inception focused on helping to pioneer the understanding of NK cell biology. Our expertise in discovering new target and developing differentiated immuno-oncology molecule has evolved to further focus on harnessing the potential of the Innate immune system across the three pillars of the immunity cycle.', 'And I would like to turn to slide number four, which represents the core of our R&D strategy. We pursue immune checkpoint inhibitors, but we also develop antibodies that target tumor antigen, and of course we have a number of antibodies targeting selected pathway in the tumor micro environment.', 'If you move to slide five, you can view our pipeline as of today. And we are very proud and excited that we have been able to build a broad and balanced portfolio of innovative assets, spanning from preclinical to commercial assets, both partnered and proprietary. We strategically partner programs in larger indications, but retain proprietary assets that benefit from our scientific and clinical development expertise and fit with our commercial strategy to build a rare cancer franchise and generate more value, starting with Lumoxiti. And we’ll come back later on these assets we have acquired end of last year from AstraZeneca.', 'So, we have been able to significantly benefit from this business development strategy. And this partnership not only validates our excellence in science, but they represent a major source of revenue for our growth and development. We are proud to say that we have received more than $550 million over the past 10 years through this collaboration, and we are also eligible to receive approximately $5.5 billion in potential future payments from our existing engagement with leaders in the world of biopharma, including AstraZeneca.', 'We are pleased to have such collaboration and as recent payments and milestones have provided us with the strong cash position of €200 million as of June 30, 2019. With these funds, we are able to continue to execute and support our growing and maturing pipeline.', '2019 has been a year of execution so far. We have initiated the cohort expansion study with our lead asset in partnership with AstraZeneca, i.e. monalizumab in order to explore the potential of a triplet combination of monalizumab along with cetuximab and in anti- PD-L1 in patients with relapse or metastatic had the neck cancer who have not been exposed to PD-1 blockers. This is a way to develop a chemo-free regimen that could be an alternative to the new stand of care in first-line, which is PD-1 plus chemotherapy.', 'We also have initiated the global open label multi-cohort Phase 2 study called TELLOMAK with our proprietary agent IPH4102. This is a study that is designed to maximize and optimize the potential commercial opportunity in T-cell lymphoma. Sézary Syndrome being the first to market strategy, but there is more potential in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The Sézary Syndrome cohort may support Innate first BLA finding.', 'Within a year, we have swiftly executed the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the STELLAR study. The STELLAR study is a Phase 1/2 study with our asset IPH5401 that we are assessing in combination with durvalumab and the first safety data will be presented at the upcoming ESMO meeting. We are on track to initiate the cohort expansion to explore the combination of 5401 and durvalumab in two tumor types, non-small-cell lung cancer IO-pretreated and resisting to IO and hepatocarcinoma patients who are IO naïve.', 'We also moved at full speed with our lead technical asset IPH5201, our anti-CD39, and we are on track to file the IND this year, as well as for our anti-CD73/IPH5301, where the plan is to file the IND first half of next year.', 'Last but not least, we started building out our U.S. commercial infrastructure and operation in order to support the commercial transition of Lumoxiti. Lumoxiti, as you know, is the first in class, FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, one of the rare forms of leukemia. This fits our long-term strategy to grow a commercial franchise that is focused on rare hem indication. And as we approach the second half of 2019 and look beyond to 2020, our efforts to execute our clinical development program will allow us multiple data readouts across the portfolio next year.', 'We remain dedicated to our immuno-oncology, R&D expertise and are focused on providing cancer patients with high unmet medical need with new potential therapeutic alternative.', \"As you may have heard in the intro from Danielle, Pierre was stuck in the traffic because of the strike we had today in Paris. But, he managed to work from the train station to the meeting room here, and I'm pleased to then hand over to Pierre to give you an update on our pipeline. Pierre?\", 'Dr. Pierre Dodion', 'Thank you very much, Mondher.', 'So, as Mondher mentioned previously, in 2019, we have made very significant progress across our partnered, proprietary and preclinical pipeline. And what I will do now is to provide some additional context around the program that Mondher mentioned and also will to briefly highlight significant events and publication.', 'Moving to slide seven, you have a short description of the mechanism of action of monalizumab, our first-in-class, anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibody that belongs to the category of immune checkpoint inhibitors. You can also notice in the little figure on the right that there are multiple opportunities for a combination of cohorts either with PD-L1, PD-L1 blockers or other molecules in particular of cetuximab.', \"And this brings me to slide number eight. In fact, we have presented encouraging data, evaluating the combination of monalizumab and cetuximab in patients with either relapse or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, either previously treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy followed by an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1. These data were previously presented at AACR, ESMO and SITC 2018. In particular, they showed response rate of -- an overall response rate of about 27.5% by various criteria with the disease control rate at 24 weeks of so called DCR of 35%. We have also performed a subgroup analysis, which revealed quite interesting durable responses in both the IO-pretreated patient in the middle column, and -- I'm sorry, IO-pretreated patient, right column, and IO-naïve patients in the middle column. Of course, those numbers are relatively small. But nevertheless, the data are very encouraging. We will present updated long-term data from this particular cohort at the upcoming ESMO meeting in a few days in Barcelona.\", 'Moving to slide number nine, we are showing here the expansion of the program, starting with the upper right corner and the so-called expansion cohort number 2. This expansion cohort is designed for patients who have received a maximum of two prior systemic regimens in the relapsed or metastatic setting, and who were also exposed to an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 agent. This makes the so-called IO-pretreated sub-population. This trial is ongoing, and we expect a preliminary data in the first half of 2020.', 'Moving now to the right lower corner and the so-called expansion cohort number 3. This is a cohort that we have initiated in April this year to explore a triple combination of monalizumab, cetuximab, and anti-PDL-1 in the patients with head and neck cancer relapsed or metastatic, but who have not been previously exposed to an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1, i.e., this is the IO-naïve patient population. And this is we think quite interesting development, because as you know, anti-PD-1, PD-L1 therapies are now moving fast in the first line setting. This could potentially be an opportunity for treatment regimen that does not incorporate chemotherapy. And we look forward to seeing data about this cohort in the second half of 2020.', \"So, let's move now to our lead cohort, here is that [ph] on slide 11. So, IPH4102 is a first-in-class humanized cytotoxicity inducing antibody. This antibody is targeting KIR3DL2, which is specifically expressed in T-cell lymphoma. So, this molecule is falling amongst tumor antigen targeting asset.\", \"And if you move to side 12, this provides you more precision on the TELLOMAK study that Mondher already mentioned. This study is conducted in different subtypes of T-cell lymphoma and was initiated in the first half of 2019. It's a very exciting compound that this asset has been really advanced by Innate from the preclinical stage now to later clinical stage. Again, this TELLOMAK study is a global multi-cohort study including on the top cohort number one designed for basically Sézary Syndrome post-mogamulizumab exposure. And this cohort number 1 could potentially lead to a BLA filing.\", 'We did receive Fast Track designation from the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year, and we are working of course closely with the agency. In June this year, at the 2019 International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma or ICML conference, we presented the TELLOMAK study design as well as additional preclinical data, which showed that IPH4102 and chemotherapy in combination enhance the expression of KIR3DL2 and also provide superior antitumor activity. This provides a rationale for testing this combination in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma or PTCL. This was further discussed during the webcast that we hosted together with Professor Pierluigi Porcu, Director of the Division of Medical Oncology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. And a replay of this webcast is available on our website.', 'So, this leads me to the two additional cohorts, the one in pink, in the middle, and the one in yellow at the bottom. Starting with the pink one. This cohort is designed for patients with mycosis fungoides, which is the largest subset of PTCL and in which IPH4102 will be tested as single agent therapy. IPH4102 will also be evaluated in combination with standard chemotherapy in second line PTCL. This is illustrated in the bottom cohort in yellow. IPH4102 in addition strategically fits very nicely into a rare hematology oncology commercial franchise and could have significant synergies with our Lumoxiti commercial strategy.', 'Finally, you will also notice that the trial does include both KIR3DL2 expressor and non-expressor patient for MF and PTCL.', 'I’m now, moving to slide 14. This illustrates the mechanism of action for our second clinical stage for proprietary [ph] or IPH5401. IPH5401 is an anti-C5aR monoclonal antibody with the novel mechanism of action. And we are leading the exploration of this compound as a potential treatment in oncology. We are looking forward to presenting data on this compound at an upcoming scientific conference.', 'And if you move to slide 15, you have there some additional details on the first-in-man study that we are conducting. We have performed dose escalation trial that allowed us to select recommended Phase 2 dose. And we are now ready to initiate this year the expansion cohort, one of which will be in non-small-cell lung IO-pretreated and the other one in hepatocarcinoma IO-naïve. We expect to have a preliminary data in the second half of 2020.', 'Finally, on page 17, a few words on our preclinical pipeline. As you can see, we have an extensive pipeline of innovative immunotherapies that are ranging across all three of our pillars. This pipeline continues to grow. Our discovery engine has gained credibility, certainly due to the partnership with Sanofi and AstraZeneca.', \"I'm very pleased to say that our data on preclinical assets were published in key journals. All these publications may be found on our website, just quickly a publication status report, which just has key assets targeting the immunosuppressive tumor for micro environment IPH5201, which is an anti-CD39 agent and IPH5301 and anti-CD73. These agents are targeting the adenosine pathway. Additionally, our Chief Scientific Officer, Eric Vivier he has been -- is the author of a Cell publication that provides data on the potential first-in-class multifunctional NKp46 in cancer immunotherapy and also importantly Eric made a presentation on these data at the annual meeting of AACR.\", \"So, we have done -- what we've done with our clinical program, we'll continue to follow the signs to leverage the knowledge of our partners, academic collaborators and key opinion leaders to generate this kind of insightful data.\", \"And I'll hand it over back to you, Mondher.\", 'Mondher Mahjoubi', 'Thank you, Pierre, for this overview of our preclinical and clinical development pipeline.', 'Now, I would like to shift to the commercial asset, Lumoxiti. As I said, an FDA approved medicine for the treatment of relapsed/refractory patient with hairy cell leukemia. The acquisition of Lumoxiti end of last year, accelerated our strategy to transition the Company to commercial stage organization, and of course, gives us the opportunity and the ability to build U.S. commercial infrastructure and eventually, of course, expand from there to other geographies as -- such as Europe, for example.', 'Our long-term goal is to build a rare cancer franchise that in the future will be able to provide revenues to continue to support our R&D initiative and grow our pipeline. I would like now to introduce our U.S. General Manager, Jennifer Butler to provide an update on the U.S. operation and the Lumoxiti commercial transition. Jennifer?', 'Jennifer Butler', 'Thank you, Mondher.', \"So, please refer to slide 19 and 20 for this part of my presentation. Since I've joined in March, we've made much progress in building out the U.S. commercial infrastructure and operations. The U.S. headquarters will be in Rockville, Maryland, just north of Washington, D.C. We now have nearly 20 U.S. employees, which means we've hired more than two-thirds of our U.S. team and we intend to be fully staffed by the end of the year.\", \"Let me shift back to Lumoxiti specifically as kind of depicted on slide 19. There are approximately 1,000 new cases of hairy cell leukemia in the U.S. every year, and about a third of those patients fall within Lumoxiti label. And as we've stated before, Lumoxiti is the first new available treatment in 20 years for relapsed and refractory patients who received at least two prior systemic therapies.\", \"I wanted to note that we will -- during Q4, our Innate sales reps will begin meeting directly with physicians and accounts. And we intend to have fully transitioned all physician-facing activities from AstraZeneca by the annual ASH meeting, which will be at the beginning of December. And by the end of the year, we expect to have three MSLs and 10 sales reps in total. And I would note that as we prepare for this commercial transition, when working in rare diseases, whether in oncology or other therapeutic areas, there's an increased need to ensure we're finding those patients and their physicians that are aware of Lumoxiti as a new treatment option.\", \"Now, moving to slide 20. Just looking at kind of this build out here. We continue to work closely with AstraZeneca during the transition, as noted in the bottom left, and leverage their commercial insight. We look forward to gaining our own insights on this patient population and implementing a fit to purpose commercial model to further enhance penetration. Therefore, we'll be strategically reaching out beyond the hairy cell leukemia centers of excellence across the United States, and executing the right marketing and sales next to identify these HCL patients and prescribers. We have also started to establish a presence with patient advocacy groups, such as the hairy cell leukemia foundation, as well as other key opinion leaders.\", \"I guess, from a personal standpoint, I wanted to say that we have a dedicated and experienced commercial team that is truly excited to be part of Innate Pharma’s mission to provide new treatment options to patients fighting cancers, starting with Lumoxiti. We continue to remain on track for the timelines laid out at the time of the deal for the full transition of Lumoxiti to Innate from AstraZeneca by mid-2020. And I know we're looking forward to a great kickoff meeting at ASH in which we’ll be establishing kind of Innate’s commercial presence.\", 'So, Mondher, with that, I will turn it back to you.', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Terrific. Thank you, Jennifer. I'm really excited and the entire leadership team is very supportive and looking forward to this transition by the end of the year.\", 'I would like to briefly add that this is a unique situation actually, in which the agreement with AstraZeneca is allowing us to leverage their commercial infrastructure and knowhow while we establish our own. Being that hairy cell leukemia affects the small number of patients, it allows us to build our own commercial footprint in the U.S. to later be able to leverage it for other assets, such as IPH4102, if approve it in the future. Great endeavor, and again looking forward to the ASH meeting.', \"It is now my pleasure to introduce Innate Pharma's CFO, Laure-Hélène Mercier, who will give an overview on our financial results. Laure-Hélène?\", 'Laure-Hélène Mercier', 'Thank you, Mondher, and good day, everyone.', 'So, you can refer to slide 22 and 23. I will start as usual with by far one of our key metrics, our cash position. Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and financial assets, including non-current financial instruments amounted to €200.3 million as of the end of the half year. In the first half of 2019, we received €65 million as a remainder of the payment associated with the AstraZeneca agreement signed in October ‘18. This position also takes into account the aggregate of €21.5 million payments due to our partner and licensees Novo Nordisk and Orega, as a result of the ‘18 deal.', 'As a reminder, we ended the fiscal year 2018 with €202.7 million. Hence, the underlying cash burn excluding the multiple payments to and from partners was €49 million during the first half of the year.', 'We are pleased with our cash runway, which is about two years. This is based on our current pipeline and development plans that cover on the critical path for each of our programs. We expect the burn rate to continue to increase as we are growing and maturing pipeline, but at a less aggressive rate. We will continue to examine our clinical development programs to maximize the value of our pipeline and potential future market opportunities, and we will be diligent to ensure we maintain a reasonable spend and flexibility in our cash allocation.', 'Going now to the P&L, for the sake of time, I will only comment the main and most significant lines. You have very detailed press release that you can refer to for more information. So, on the revenue line, our revenue and other income amounted to €59.2 million and mainly result of revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements, with the remainder being the research tax credit.', 'As usual, revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly relate to the spreading of payment, which is by Innate Pharma in the context of the AstraZeneca agreement, of which €24.3 million is for monalizumab and €22.5 million for IPH5201. I remind you that this has no impact on cash, this is an accounting trading of those accounts. Please also note that the recognition of IPH52 is almost completed [indiscernible] of IPH5201 is almost completed with 5 million remaining and that are expected to be recognized in the second half of ‘19.', \"With regard to monalizumab, we still have €81 million to be recognized with an estimated horizon in ‘21. Hence, we think about the revenue line in the first half of 2019 as exceptional, especially with regard to the recognition of the IPH52 upfront in the very short period of time. And again, I remind you that it's non-cash item.\", 'Revenue from invoicing of research and development costs for the period was €4.4 million compared to €0.2 million the year before. It relates to our agreements with AstraZeneca for IPH52 and IPH54.', 'Now, going to expenses. Operating expenses for the first half of ‘19 amounted to €46 million compared to €38 million for the first half of ‘18, 80% relating to R&D. R&D expenses increased by €4.3 million to €36.6 million and primarily related to activities, without surprise, for monalizumab IPH4102, IPH5401and IPH5201.', 'In the first half of ‘19 subcontracting costs have mainly been stable, as many of our clinical programs were transitioning, resulting in lower cost for mona, IPH41 and IPH54, based on R&D cost new one, in relation to Lumoxiti for regulatory purposes, and our other technical program.', 'Increase in R&D costs are mainly related to the increase in amortization of monalizumab following the payment Novo Nordisk and the stuff of amortization of IPH52 and Lumoxiti. You should expect to see a larger increase in R&D in the second half of ‘19 due to the fact the [indiscernible] for IPH41 and the expected cohort expansion for IPH54.', 'Turning quickly to G&A. General and administrative expenses increased by €3.7 million to €9.3 million for the period, and most notably personnel expenses including compensation, but also share based payment. Share based payment is a non-cash item. Advisory and consulting expenses also increased. We expect to continue to see an increase in G&A as we expand internationally and hire more talent in addition to our commercial expenses in relation to Lumoxiti going forward.', 'Now quick look to this new line item that you can see under operating expenses, the net income from distribution agreements. As you know, this new line is due to the agreements with AstraZeneca. It relates to the Lumoxiti net global inflows and outflows received from and paid to AstraZeneca. As a reminder, so AstraZeneca, as you all know, is currently in charge of all commercial aspects of Lumoxiti and is considered as principal. And the distribution agreements we recognize for the first half of 2019 a net loss of €3.8 million in the context obviously of the launch of the drug.', 'As a reminder, through the 2019 transition, we have a cost sharing agreement with AstraZeneca. To give you a bit more of a flavor around how we are seeing the cost structure, the one we foresee is low double digits which will support the commercialization of Lumoxiti, but also more importantly, the implementation of a commercial infrastructure and a global cross-functional operation.', \"Our goal here, and I'm speaking for Lumoxiti is to become cash neutral in about two years. We remain focused on having a disciplined approach to capital allocation to support the appropriate investments that will enter the long-term success of Lumoxiti. Our global strategy remains to invest in our science and clinical pipeline, and bring new treatments for cancer patients.\", 'With that, I will now turn the call back to Mondher.', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', 'Thank you. Thank you all, Laure-Hélène. I would now like to take this time to review the upcoming news flow over the next 18 months and invite you to move to slide 24.', \"In a nutshell, and for the remainder of the year, we will have safety data from the Phase 1 dose escalation study testing IPH5401 in combination with durvalumab presented at the ESMO end of this month, as well as an update, a long-term update from the cohort 1 of the 203 study that we published last year at ASCO, combining monalizumab with cetuximab in head and neck cancer. That's in the short-term. We will also find the IND for IPH5201 as well as the BLA for Lumoxiti in the EU regulatory submission.\", \"Finally, as you've heard from Jen, ASH is going to be a defining moment for the commercial organization and the launch of our commercial team. So, we’ll have Innate Pharma first present at such a meeting and we will provide an additional update on Lumoxiti.\", \"For 2020, you can expect preliminary data from the IO-pretreated cohort in head and neck cancer test in monalizumab and cetuximab to be presented in the first half of next year, and the IND filing for IPH5301. That's essentially the highlight of the first half of the year, next year.\", 'In the second half of 2020, we’ll have multiple readouts across our pipeline, which include A, the outcome of the first stage analysis of the PTCL and the MF cohorts of the TELLOMAK study. Remember that we have the KIR3DL2 over-expression and non-over-expression parallel cohort and will have stage 2 analysis performed in next year.', 'The second readout will come from the triplet combination of monalizumab, cetuximab and in anti-PDL-1. We will have preliminary data from that expansion cohort, which I remind you is assets in the efficacy and the safety of this triplet in patients with relapsed/refectory head and neck cancer who have not been exposed to PD-1 blocker.', 'As you can see, we continue to have a very robust and dynamic pipeline. And we look forward to sharing more update with you in the near future.', \"So, now, if you turn to page 25 and in summary, I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways. First of all, this has been a fantastic year, but the year of execution mainly. And in particular, we have made significant progress across our partners, proprietary and pre-clinical pipeline. Number two, we continue to make great progress in building out the U.S. commercial infrastructure and operation, and we look forward to update you on these in the near future. Last but not least, we have a very strong financial position that will enable us to continue to invest in our pipeline.\", 'With that, I would like to thank you all for joining the call. And I will now turn it back to the operator to take your questions. Thank you very much.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sean Lee of H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Sean Lee', 'Good morning, guys. And, thank you for taking my questions. My first one is on the timelines for the Sézary cohort of the TELLOMAK study, since -- from the -- it sounds that that could potentially be your first product approval, or independently developed product to be approved?', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I’ll just repeat the question to make I'm sure everyone got it. It's about the timing for the BLA filing for IPH4102 in the Sézary Syndrome for mogamulizumab, that's right?\", 'Sean Lee', 'The timing for the results as well as potential filling.', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', 'Okay. Then, I hand over to Pierre Dodion to provide you with a more detailed answer. ', 'Dr. Pierre Dodion', \"Yes. Thank you for the question. As we have indicated, we anticipate the first results of actually all cohorts, including the one that you're mentioning the because 2021, I think that in terms of having full detailed results that will be supportive of a potential BLA, that may take a little bit more time. We have announced previously that we would go to file a BLA at some point in 2022, all these data subject to some situation depending on the status of it, how will actually take place?\", 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Thank you, Pierre. I would like to add maybe just for the sake of clarity here that this is a 60-patient, single arm cohort, where the primary endpoint is not just response rate, but also duration of response, progression-free survival, and of course, quality of life. And as you know, not only this is a quite rare disease, but actually, we want to make sure that we have mature data. So, it's not just about presenting the response rate. I think, the signal we've seen from the Phase 1 is quite powerful and about the mechanism of action, the level of activity of the drug. But we need to make sure that we have mature data that will satisfy the FDA and hopefully other agency about the requirement for filing and approval.\", 'Sean Lee', 'I see. Thanks for the additional color. That was very helpful. Now, my second question is on the upcoming Lumoxiti filing in the EU. So, what’s still needed to be done for that part? And what are your commercial plans?', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"So, what needs to be done, you mean, in terms of regulatory filing, that’s kind of business as usual. Of course, we're working with our partner AstraZeneca with this filing, and we will go through the normal process of review by the agency, expecting approval within the classic timeframe, i.e. between 9 and 12 months. So, we expect to have approval in Europe, if everything goes well in the second half for next year.\", \"For the commercialization of Lumoxiti in Europe, we are working on the business model we would like to implement, knowing that in Europe, you have the challenge of having different mechanism and system for reimbursement. So, we'll adjust and adapt the business model according to the regulatory but also reimbursement landscape with of course focus on the larger countries. But, we are also making sure that the patients who need to have access to the drug will have access to the drug within a very specific early access program.\", 'Operator', 'And your next question comes from Graig Suvannavejh from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Graig Suvannavejh', \"Great. Good morning from New York. And congratulations on the progress made so far, and thanks for taking my questions. I've got two, at least right now. The first one really has to do with the commercialization aspects and the transition between AstraZeneca and Innate. So, maybe the first question I have is, can you -- and maybe this question is specifically for Jennifer. Jennifer, if you can describe kind of what those interactions are like in this transition period? I mean, obviously, there's a -- at one point in time that it will be 100% Innate, but could you maybe give us some color on what the dynamic is between the interactions between the two companies, at least at this point in time, and how those -- how that has gone so far?\", 'Mondher Mahjoubi', 'So, Graig, you said, you have two questions. This is the first question and I will…', 'Graig Suvannavejh', 'That’s correct. This is the first one. ', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', 'And the second question?', 'Graig Suvannavejh', \"The second question actually relates to Lumoxiti itself and how that -- if you could maybe describe how -- with some color, what that commercial uptake is looking like. I realize, it's a relatively small product with a very small patient population. It doesn't seem that we'll get sales visibility, but maybe some color on how you think that's going?\", 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Thank you, Graig. These are two great questions. I'm going to start with the second one, to provide some color, and then hand over to Jen to complete and answer the first question. As you all know, hairy cell leukemia, basically there has been no innovation for the last 25 years, and Lumoxiti is the first drug approved since the mid-90s, when the purine -- adenosine has been established as a standard of care. So, clearly, there is a treatment paradigm to change and to establish a new standard of care that AstraZeneca has done a great job starting. And of course, our goal is to, in this handover, make sure that we continue into that same direction and make sure we educate the community about this innovative therapeutic approach and the benefit it provides for patients.\", 'I think, the good news is that we are seeing really interest from the community about this new drug, and of course, patients benefit from it. But clearly, it may take time, before we generate real world data and before we have enough follow-up and enough maturity of the market to really provide a solid answer. What we can say is that penetration in this market today is great. I think, we provide a terrific new opportunity for patients to get durable complete responses. Just remember, the data that were presented already at ASH, and we will update you with the new data by the end of the year. But, clearly, the rate of complete response, durable complete response and the rate of negative minimal residual disease really made the difference.', \"I'll ask Jen to provide more color on the market penetration so far, and of course, the collaboration with AstraZeneca on the different aspects of the marketing of the asset.\", 'Jennifer Butler', \"Thanks, Mondher. Yes. Maybe just to round out and kind of close that as it relates to the color commentary for the launch. I think, exactly that point is that -- I made a comment during my prepared remarks regarding really looking about the need to find patients that are kind of outside the centers of excellence. I think, that's an insight, obviously, that we think will help kind of increase penetration over time, relative to where some of the initial sales were. And I think also to what's inferred in my comments regarding kind of a sales and marketing mix is that we think that we can also kind of increase penetration by looking at different types of marketing and digital and social tactics that I think are particularly necessary when you're dealing in a rare disease category.\", \"And I think that, again, what puts in a really good position is that we really are going to approach the market with a rare oncology view than just a hem oncology view. And I think that's the difference. And so, I think that we've -- obviously, excited to see Lumoxiti and the guidelines, we're seeing these kinds of early wins. And obviously, we want to see kind of increased gain from here.\", \"You're asking about the commercialization aspects, and maybe I think I'll describe it in really two ways. First, let me just say that the collaboration between my commercial team and AstraZeneca is quite exquisite. It's incredibly warm. They want to really see Lumoxiti succeed on behalf of hairy cell leukemia patients. We have weekly calls at a senior leadership level too. And if you think about it, if you take a step back, AstraZeneca still will hold rest of world rights, we're still collaborating in the EU. The U.S. transition is going incredibly well. Actually next week, as I mentioned, our MSLs will be starting field transition.\", \"So, just as it relates to -- we're working in house to have a lot of hard work in house and doing this transition. The transition in the field is actually very short. We're really trying to reduce customer disruption. That’s our number one priority, reduce customer disruption.\", \"So, MSLs, really in the next six weeks, the reps will transition, a very, very short transition in the field in November. And as I mentioned by ASH, we will kind of fully embrace the customers and from a field facing standpoint. There are some additional works in the back end, we mentioned 2020. That has to do with almost back office things, distribution pharmacy and hub. So, so far, really, it's been -- I've worked in a lot of collaboration, and this has been an incredible -- it truly is a collaboration.\", 'So hopefully that provides some commentary about the commercial aspects and the interaction so far.', 'Graig Suvannavejh', 'Okay. Thank you very much. Maybe I could have a follow-up just on that. Are you guys in a position to say how many patients have actually been treated with Lumoxiti? And what that experience is like so far?', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Actually, the straight answer is, no. It's been in the hands of AstraZeneca and they do not communicate on the commercial performance for Lumoxiti in general. And, we will be in a position to provide such guidance when we will take over because clearly next year we will have transparent -- not transparent, actually, we'll share with you actually where we are in terms of our penetration, essentially, in terms of number of patient, yes, you're right. But, the number of cycle, number of vials, et cetera, are the metrics that we cannot completely control.\", 'Graig Suvannavejh', 'Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe one last follow-up just on TELLOMAK. Are there -- what are the types of things you can do in terms of patient enrollment in that study? Are there things that you can do to kind of move timelines along with regards to the speed of enrollment of that study, particularly in Sézary Syndrome?', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Thanks for that. I got to provide -- me and Pierre to go back to that specific question, I tried in my answer earlier to highlight the need not only to enroll patients, but also to follow up and to have enough follow-up for progression-free survival in particular and duration of response. I'm Pierre to maybe give more color on the clinical operation aspect and what we are doing in order to expedite the enrollment while we are again, trying to keep loose long follow-up that we need for the primary endpoint of the study.\", 'Dr. Pierre Dodion', \"Yes. Thank you, Mondher. It's coming down to excellence in the clinical operations and more specifically make sure that we identify the largest pool of patients that is a geographic -- as you know for many, many indications that is the half, such geographic distribution differences. For example, in our case, the prior exposure to model is important to consider. So, again, we are looking very, very carefully where we can maximize the number of paid research prior exposure. The other aspect is to -- is the adequate balance between number of sites and recruitment per site. Of course, we could increase the number of sites, we beyond what is conventional, but then as you know, I'm sure very well, the number of patients per site is becoming very, very small, they have questions about -- they investigate fully on the top of the study, about data quality, et cetera, et cetera. So, what I'm seeing here is that it's really a question of selecting the proper site, making sure that they are fully trained and they know perfectly the protocol and more importantly, that they have access to the kind of patients that we are looking for.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And your final question comes from the line of Martial Descoutures from Oddo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.', 'Martial Descoutures', 'My first question is on your decision to co-fund the monalizumab Phase 3. Could you give us more details on the decision, and is it a decision for all the Phase 3 program or maybe for specific indications? And my second question is on the financial side, Laure-Hélène, could you come back on the cash burn stated in the next 12 months, including the Lumoxiti launch TELLOMAK Phase 2 and so? It will be really helpful.', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Thank you, Martial, for your questions. Two great questions. I'm going to start with the first one. The decision to co-fund the development of monalizumab for its registration purpose is a decision that covers all registration study that will be performed. However, there is a cap as you may know and the level of contribution of Innate Pharma is limited to 30%, and cap it anyway; and B, will be basically financed by the milestones we will receive when those Phase 3 will be initiated. So, it's not just head and neck or one indication in particular, it's all indications. But it's limited in terms of breakdown between Astra and Innate Pharma in this cap. That's for the first question.\", \"And of course, the decision has been always a strategic decision that will allow us to be in the driver's seat to continue to impact and drive the -- clinical development and the of course, lifecycle management of monalizumab. But not only that, we will of course share profit in Europe for all indications, including the ones that we may not have been able to co-fund, given that the cap has been raised. So, this is the first question. The second one, about the cash burn, Laure-Hélène will give you more color on the question.\", 'Laure-Hélène Mercier', \"I think, what we can say is that on the cash burn increase, it’s going to continue to increase as you see our pipeline growing in that way. But if you look in the past, basically, the underlying cash burn, so without exception that has doubled over the last three years. So, you should continue to see an increase, but at lower pace. So, let's say that, especially on the R&D part, you should see in the second half of ‘19 an increase. And in 2020, based on the current pipeline, and on the current development that we have, we should have a much, much lower increase compared to the past years. That said, obviously, it's not taking into account the discussion that we might have with our partner, notably around the decision that we just made for funding and how it's going to develop in 2020.\", 'Operator', 'Thank you. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Mahjoubi for closing remarks.', 'Mondher Mahjoubi', \"Thank you. Just to say that we are very excited with the progress we've made in 2019, very excited by the collaboration that we have established with our partners, in particular AstraZeneca. The clinical development program is being implemented and we'll deliver. As I said, essentially 2020 will be a year of multiple readouts, but in the same time, it will be the year where we will, for the first time, be on the commercial stage promoting and commercializing Lumoxiti in the U.S. And finally, as Laure-Hélène just said, this cash position that we have in the two years runway is something that of course is very, very comfortable in terms of investing in our pipeline, investing in our key assets, and having those in addition to any essential milestone payment that we may have in the future.\", 'With that said, I would like to thank everyone and wish you a wonderful day.

I will go through the key points in the quarter and then as usual open the call for our questions. A lot of what happened in the second quarter was similar to the first in the sense that we have got two very distinct stories in our business on the better performance side. Our core Northern businesses had another strong quarter. Our comps were between the 3.5%, 5% range through general merchandise in the north and as we have said before, I have commented on the – the general economic conditions are favorable for us and that includes Alaska, which had a strong fishing season. And as we head into the PFD which is expected to be equal to last year’s, we are certainly optimistic that whether it’s Northern Canada with infrastructure spending, mining activity, we should be going for sales, managing the business on the margin side with the expenses controlled, but really in a get sales mode and that’s where we look at things. And with the work that we are doing in different areas, it seems to be paying off. And then longer term, we continue to build our business in other ways.', 'If I skip down to the Caribbean, there is a really market by market story there, because of distinct nature of the economies, but also the competitive situations. Overall, we call our CUL or Cost-U-Less competitive strategy, which focuses on signature categories, everything from fresh, produce and meat all the way into baby and actually liquor. These have all been strong drivers for us. And although, CUL came a little short of plan they were up nicely to last year as was our business in the British Virgin Islands. If there is a soft spot in Cost-U-Less, it was on the Pacific side, a little bit in Fiji and in American Samoa. So when we step back and look at the business and our remote retailing strength and how it’s been brought to market, we are generally pleased. There is always room for improvement, but we like the way the trend is going.', 'Before talking about Giant Tiger, I just want to about costs, what we refer to as non-store costs, the margin, operating margin gains above LY for all of our banners ex-Giant Tiger, are before admin. We have talked about – I am not sure what the right term is anymore whether they are unusual or one-time or restructuring, but as we behind the scenes change our business so that we can run it more localized and put more authority closer to the regions that we do business in, there has been a cost attached to that. And we have disclosed and talked about the relocation of our office, store support office in Seattle, actually back up to Anchorage and then creating an office in Florida. That’s being going along fine from the pacing of it and the staffing. There is a few key roles we still need to fill, but it’s also involved the relocation and some people not in the business that were in the business before, so between relocation and termination. Some of those costs are still back into Canada. There have been some changes in Canada as well. And perhaps, we should have been clearer on that at the last quarter that where those costs would be incurred and a little higher than we might have thought in June as well, they are not out of control, but there is the timing factor there. So certainly, that was a – I think we had talked – we talked about it in the MD&A and the press release, $3.5 million is the range of those kinds of costs that were incurred. So, some of that will carry forward. We are going to have some more of that cost cleaned up in Q3 and then we will be stable as far as it goes with our regional approach to the business and the office relocations to Anchorage and Florida.', 'So now to Giant Tiger, Giant Tiger clearly underperformed again. It was a drag for us. If I break it down, I would say that weak seasonal performance hurt us and that’s kind of the stir that mixes the drink in the sense it is, you need to have seasonal sales driving margin dollars. We have some very strong comps against us in May which were tough to beat. June was very, very poor. But otherwise that would be our prime selling season and then July, we had great weather and there was markdown season. But behind the – beneath the surface there we have had to take a hard look at how we are running the stores. We actually have made a management change this week on the leadership side of Giant Tiger and the operationalization of, call it, the Giant Tiger system and how we can be better at that and also lean into Giant Tiger to support us. You have heard some of these things before allowed us block and tackle at store level. We don’t fundamentally believe that the Giant Tiger is a store concept, it’s fatally flawed. It doesn’t mean it’s the only way those stores can be run as Giant Tiger’s, but it is something that we are not giving up on at all that way. We just know that whatever we do, whatever the stores are, they have to be well executed and we think we dropped the ball there and the change we have made at the leadership level isn’t the be-all and the end-all. We all own this and have to come up with better execution.', 'So specifically to seasonal, a lot of it has to do with our markdown management, our ordering. There are some things that back up a bit before I go on, indirect effects of China shipping rates with the tariff crunch avoidance and some delays there. But back in our, what we can control, it’s the day-to-day work we take on with our fashion managers on the floor, our store managers and the field support to make sure we are ordering the right mix, we are getting behind the key items that will drive the business. We are not shy on that. Sometimes when you are not a franchise, you can be shy. There is no excuse though. We have done very, very well with this model in the past and can get back to some of the basics on how that can work for us now and in the future. And that carries forward to the other parts of the hard goods and soft goods part of the business. It’s not just seasonal window coverage, it’s a huge business at Giant Tiger across Canada and we need to get our share. There is no reason we can’t, but we have to commit to the space and the quantification that will drive that business. So these are all things that sometimes easier said than done. The individual that’s coming into run the division for us did run the division for over 10 years during a much more profitable growing phase. And we believe he is the right fit for getting back at some of these disciplines that will drive our bottom line – or protect our bottom line, but also protect our market share.', 'On the food side, so the other half of the business, much lower margin, it’s been at risk for a while. I think at this point that we have over-managed the business by trying a lot of different things that impacted margin and have not driven the traffic to the extent that they were expected to. In this case, food has to be stabilized in terms of shrink, some of the things again that we have tried have cost us. Our fresh meat has – we over-invested in that program, put it into all of the stores and we have paid a price in the first half of our promotional strategies were are also costly. So we are pulling back on that and again trying to just realizing that food still has a very important traffic-driving role, but not trying to get more out of it than it deserves and making sure that our focus on the hard goods and soft goods side of the business is where it needs to be.', 'From a timing standpoint, although you heard me say this in June and I am disappointed that I got it wrong, of course, that I couldn’t – I would not have forecasted this topic or – that we just had and I am not forecasting that for Q3 as we model this out and we look at our comps from last year, which were very bad. We don’t see that kind of a drag, the magnitude of the drag on the performance that we had. And just to remind investors, I mean, Giant Tiger, there is a number of things with North West. I commented at our Annual Meeting that it wasn’t core in terms of our competencies and you can draw all kinds of conclusions from that except that it puts it in a tougher situation in terms of focus and we have to delegate that focus, we have to lean into GT and their expertise and not assume that we have it, because there is enough going on in the life of North West to build up proprietary expertise there vis-à-vis what we are paying Giant Tiger for. But it still is something that in the totality and I will talk about that in the back end of the business, the buying volume it creates for us the distribution efficiencies that is material in terms of being a benefit.', 'So we like the volume. We obviously wanted to be more profitable. The delta on that, decline in profitability has been painful for us in terms of overall results, but we also take a long-term view. We hope our investors do as well. We know we have a very solid business. We have got fantastic we think locations with our stores. We have built them out very thoughtfully in Western Canada. We have got good store teams and we think it’s that collection of stores, locations is still very, very valuable. And then again it drives efficiencies in the rest of our business, which are sometimes hard to attain given the wide breadth of how we operate. So, we certainly don’t take that for granted. We have put the right amount of value against that in terms of protecting it. So, that’s where Giant Tiger sits. It’s a focus and without being a total distraction from the other very attractive upsides we have in our business. And I think we have the right balance in place and we are going to keep our foot down on performance improvements. And when I look at Q3, Q4, I see us with much more upside vis-à-vis the first two quarters of the year in terms of Giant Tiger performance. So, that’s the comment that I will make right now on GT and of course be fully prepared to answer any questions you have.', 'There weren’t a lot of other focus highlights. We opened our 45th Giant Tiger store in North Battleford. I will just point out that we are continuing to be optimistic and positive about our more northern and rural Giant Tiger locations and this would be one of those. We have another one opening in Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, which we think will be very successful as a hub for North and Central Saskatchewan coming up in Q4.', 'I think with that, with those comments, operator, I will now open the call for questions.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will hear from your first caller. Please go ahead.', 'Matt Bank', 'Hey, it’s Matt Bank at CIBC. Can you hear me?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Good morning, Matt.', 'Matt Bank', 'Hey, good morning. I guess I wanted to start talking about the insurance commentary you had in your outlook. So, we already knew that it costs $4 million more this year, but you suggested that maybe costs could rise further. Could you just talk a bit more about how you see insurance cost playing out in future years? And is there a chance that you could lose insurance on certain assets that are currently insured and how all that would look?', 'John King', 'Sure. I will take that, Matt. Yes, as I have put in the – or as we have put in the outlook there we are seeing increasing pressures on insurance both from a premium perspective and a reduction in capacity and writing insurance. And if you look at what’s happened with – just recently with Hurricane Dorian, for example and the devastation that has happened insurance companies are cutting back on how much insurance they are going to be writing in those regions, particularly the Caribbean. So that in and of itself, I think is going to put more pressure on premiums as well the losses coming out of not only Hurricane Dorian, but go back to Irma and Maria, etcetera. So I do see continued pressure on insurance premiums, how much that will be going forward is not known yet. We have locked in most of our insurance premiums for the year. We do have some policies that renewed late Q2 and some that will renew in Q3. So we will get a little bit more visibility in Q3 on that piece of it, but I do see premiums. They are not going down, that’s for sure. It’s a question of how much they go up. So that’s point one. Point two, I think it’s important to focus on or mention what we can control in our business and we are very focused on loss control. We have talked about in the report increasing the resiliency of our stores in the Caribbean to a Category 5 hurricane level. In Northern Canada, we have conducted loss mitigation audits from a fire risk perspective and making changes there. So, everything that we can do to control and reduce the risk of loss, that’s what we are doing, but there is some global conditions here in insurance that are continuing to be at play.', 'Matt Bank', 'Okay. And in terms of the capital investment on your end, is there an estimate you could provide in terms of annual CapEx or anything like that in terms of weatherproofing your assets?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'The amount of the program – maybe John you can comment how much we spent this year and what we are forecasting next year for that. It’s not significant, but it’s a few million dollars.', 'John King', 'Yes. It would be – like the hurricane resiliency piece is this year and that once we do that then that will be behind us. It’s about CAD 3 million on that piece of it. Ongoing in Canada we would expect that CapEx to run around $2 million to $3 million in terms of Northern Canada and I think that work will continue on certainly through this year and into next year as well.', 'Matt Bank', 'Okay. And then I want to shift to Giant Tiger, I guess first is, are you still playing with the strategy in the store model in Giant tiger or with the new leader, are you getting towards a point where you are looking to execute on the plan?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'The plan is being focused on for quite – for about two quarters already and is simple. The main parts of it is gap closing like type stores and Giant Tiger East that we think are – should be the ones that we chase in terms of the performance and execution. So, we breakdown where there is a gap it could be by a class, department, the category. It could do with margin rate or sales per store and then we get further into the details of why we are falling short on what should be a comparable performance. That’s been going on. What we are not happy with is the focus on execution at store level. And the way we are structured on this we have a President of Canadian Retail with two divisions, Northern Canada Retail and Giant Tiger essentially and his time has been pulled more into GT and then of course working with the Giant Tiger team. The leadership change we have made is at the VP of the Giant Tiger team level and that individual, again, as I have mentioned has a lot of familiarity with the Giant Tiger division, hasn’t been directly engaged in it for some time. So we have given him the accountability to get this plan fully executed, but also to step back a little bit, we don’t want to do a complete step back, because we think we know what we are supposed to be doing here. But he is the first and that’s walking the stores all the time or will be. And through his eyes, we want to make sure that we haven’t missed anything. So I think inevitably, there are going to be a few small tweaks to where we focus, but it’s not like take 3 months and figure this out that we have targets to hit on a daily basis in some things and he understands that. So I think it will be 80% we are doing already better and 20% if we find some new ideas, we are going to be open to those.', 'Matt Bank', 'Okay. And when you think about the improvement in Q3 and Q4, is that more about just lopping the easier comparables or do you expect the execution to improve in the near term?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes. I think I will expect it to improve. The factor is what’s our confidence level near-term, alright, medium and long, I know these store assets, I am going to call them that or the Giant Tiger part for a second have lots of potential, financial potential. Short-term, quarter-by-quarter, I can’t ignore the lapping part. It’s very defensive, but it’s just downside mitigation that it’s just the financial fact, I guess that we are – you start to balance along the bottom more or less. So, that’s behind us. That’s there on the forecast side, but we have learnt and everybody has gotten more tuned in and experienced on how to manage this who are directly involved. And putting the President of Canada Retail, who he has lapped 1 year in his role and although there is lots of upside in Northern Canada, he knows that the GT has as well. So he has had to learn and adjust our EVP of Food who plays a key role in all this. She was new to the business and there has been some learning adjustments there. And I think that’s part of our situation is that we have had some new people enrolled and they are very, very capable, but they are still new to the situation. So I think that learning gets accelerated and mistakes get fixed quicker and we get dialed in faster. So that gives me more confidence on execution improvement in Q3, but based on what’s just happened in Q2, I am cautious and – so there is the shock absorbers, just the weak comps that we are cycling through in terms of downside protection. The upside, I am still waiting to see this cash flow over. We build momentum on our store execution and we start to see this turnaround and pickup improve store-by-store. So, I won’t say that yet. I haven’t seen enough of it.', 'Matt Bank', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] We will move to the next caller in the queue. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Hi, I just wanted to start by following up on a few strategic things. So just to clarify, for Q3 and Q4, in Giant Tiger, you are saying that, yes, the comps are so easy that you should and least be able to do as well as last year, but you are just not sure how well – how much improvement you can get at this stage?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'That would be our going in position on Q3 and Q4, yes.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Right. And sorry, the management change, who is running Giant Tiger now and what was he...', 'Edward Kennedy', 'His name is Scott McKay. And he joined us last – or early 2000s. He has been away from North West for 2 or 3 years, moved to our international division. He was – after he ran Giant Tiger for about 10 years and was also VP of Merchandising in Canada and in our international division.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'He was outside the company for the last few years and is coming back in?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Alright. And you talked about markdown management issues at Giant Tiger, can you explain a little bit more about exactly what the issues were?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes. I mean, it’s more aggressive markdowns coming out of June with the weather and having slow traction. I think we have sized that up as being an overcorrection. And I think there is – part of this led to our change on the team. I think the team was getting skittish on being long on merchandise coming out of the winter and not wanting to be long again going into fall. They certainly aren’t bad and then overcorrecting.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Okay. So I guess with the management, is it the management change that you think is going to help correct that or is it other initiatives being implemented?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Well, beneath the management change are the initiatives and it’s – and we think are the right ones. So we had as an example for the better part of the day with the Giant Tiger executive team that’s accountable for buying and merchandising. So, we sat down with them 2 weeks ago and planned – and looked at where these gaps are. Most of them were known to us, but just being very, very dialed in on that. So that plan has been worked. Part of it is prioritization too and that was my earlier comment about focusing on soft goods and hard goods and not, I would say over-managing food, not trying to be too aggressive with food promotionally and putting too much emphasis on categories that are riskier like fresh meat, shifting the manager’s attention, making sure that it’s on soft goods and hard goods on the floor of the store and just totally buying into that. So that’s a softer thing, of course. But then within the soft goods and hard goods has been very, very focused on which areas of the business we want to make a difference on. Sometimes I feel like we could swing a cat and it could hit something that we could improve and you can actually, but it’s something that is bigger than others. So, it’s that kind of focus. And I think when you have the negative comps and it hurts the business overall, people can start – careful they are not running around with their heads chopped off and try to do 10 different things half well. So of course, that’s on everyone, including myself just to make sure that’s a steady hand approach. And again, I mean in the translation of what I am saying now to one of our stores in Winnipeg this morning, there is a lot of people between that and one of the key drivers or translators is the VP role that actually runs the division. So, we want to make sure we have total confidence in that person’s ability to put the plans in place and we weren’t there for different reasons until this week actually.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'So when you talk about poor assortment management, that’s what you are talking about in terms of your mix between food and GM and the hard and soft goods categories?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes. It’s where you – what your display face into, it’s where you put your dollars for inventory, it’s your commitment to programs that when you track GT’s success and it’s not that they have success everywhere, but you have got to take advantage of the information that goes with the franchise model and really, really work that hard and it’s a discipline. There is also – you got to be thinking like an owner. I mean that’s another thing that from day one we know these stores are corporate stores that GT has a strong franchise model. They also run corporate stores. We have got to make sure that we have the enterprising mentality in our stores. And we are not – again we are not just directing people to do things, we have strong suggestions, but we also want them to be free to do what they need to do. So part of it is also checking to make sure that we have got, I think we have very, very strong people, but have we kept their education, sort of their training upped on these different areas of the business. So, the next week, they will be in Ottawa, for the mangers/owners meetings and again it’s a chance to catch up on better practices, but we have to do a deeper dive to make sure that our managers understand what the drivers are. And again, that’s the part of Scott’s job beginning this week.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Okay. And kind of outside of Giant Tiger, in your strategy commentary, you talked about moving more authority in the business closer to the different banners or regions, communities, but in the past, you have also had trouble attracting and keeping strong local management in some of these remote regions?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Right.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Now, are you not concerned that moving too much authority into these areas is going to – if you don’t have the right people in place or are you just comfortable now that you have the right people?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Well, if you were a fly on the wall, John and I would take that, but if you have heard that discussion and John may want to simplify the business further and not give us much authority, not to put him on the spot, but I come from the other side, but absolutely, no, I would not put the authority in where the capabilities doesn’t exist yet. So, it’s a walk and chew gum kind of thing where we know we have got stores that have that capability and stability, so let’s double down on their, I use that word, authority, but let them drive more of their – pull more of the merchandise into the store instead of us trying to push it from the Central. Where the store doesn’t have the capability yet, because of turnover and maybe you can fit for role, then we’re looking to push that authority down to the regional level so empower the sales manager for that region or that group of stores to make some of those calls for the stores. The way we see it, at least, they’re closer to the action than the buyer who is – I still haven’t seen yet the software template that localizes the way we want to. So we know we have to get you in the incentives just to keep – we look at the stores that have the capability and that’s our number one priority. You have heard me say that for the Northern business, anyways. And I think we’re fine with Dan McConnell, who is the President of International. He’s recognizing – it wasn’t his first priority, but he’s trying to operationalize his competitive strategy in CUL and really push that localization into Alaska. It’s becoming his – he’s finding the right individuals that will come into Alaska that will be part of our team, super-entrepreneurial. And what we’re finding is the retail background is increasingly less important than the enterprising mindset. And the – just the driver that would say, I’m really happy being in this kind of a setting, a little bit – it’s – obviously, we’re off the beaten track for some people, even when we look that way, but certainly encourage in where we do business. So really find those folks that like that, kind of work and can thrive in it. And we have many, many that do so and we know what it looks like. But no, we’re not going to squish out, we’re not going to localize buying decisions or quantification decisions where we don’t have the people yet in place to do it well. So it’s going to be a hybrid approach.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'I will now let someone else jump in get back in the queue. Thank you.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] We’ll move to the next caller. Please state your name and the company.', 'Stephen MacLeod', 'It’s Stephen MacLeod from BMO. Morning I just wanted to follow up on the Giant Tiger. And I’m sorry if you’ve already – I’m sorry if you’ve covered this in the last, sort of, questions. But can you just talk a little bit – one thing I was always interested in is, in your prepared remarks, you talked about over-managing the food side of the business and it hasn’t really driven traffic. Can you just talk a little bit about how you are approaching the food side of the Giant Tiger business to drive traffic higher and potentially move away from it?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Well, I think, we’re recognizing that half the basket don’t have food in them at all and the crossover is there. But it’s – in terms of who puts soft goods in a basket as well as picks up a produce or a cereal, it’s not – it’s a meaningful percentage, but it’s not enough that you should just be completely fixated by that. So our – my point here is that when you tweak something, when you just say that – we have – we took all the fresh meat out of the stores. In fact, the decision was made for us 2 years ago by the supplier, because they decided to supply China, maybe not the best move now. But the – so then we’re scrambling. We have no supplier – because we have no supplier for case-ready meat, so then we find one a year later. Meanwhile, we’ve lived with resetting those 12-foot cases, 8-foot cases with a different offering. And now we’re feeling gee, we want to have our – shoppers needs meat in their baskets. We need – but we’re not a full shop. I think that’s the other aspect we got to keep reminding ourselves. Obviously, we have limited space that we’ve dedicated to food, means that we’re not the only place they’re going to go for food. Can we be the first place they go? Aspirationally, yes. But realistically, we’re – people are going to come means we’ve got great food deals and we’re reliably in-stock, it was used to being in Stockton in North to the Giant Tiger stores which are basically located. And our prices are right at a discount level vis-à-vis the other discounters in the market. When you get past that, so, for example, in the meat, you put the meat all – now you go back to meat, because you’ve got a supplier and you remember why meat wasn’t so great. It’s the ordering, the shrink both the – shrinking out from a staff standpoint and the waste and spoilage. These kinds of items in our stores are just going to go slight tangent given where our stores are located are highly problematic from the staff standpoint. And we’ve had a number – a very large spike. We’ve had to invest in different safety and security measures, not just because of the fresh meat, it just – part of it is because of the meth usage in cities like Winnipeg and Saskatoon some of our downtown stores. But – I mean, said all that, my point to this is trying to do too much in a very small space for food, trying to replicate too much of a full supermarket and not playing to your strengths. Again, the strengths would be great prices, convenient locations, consistently in-stock, solid promotions, but not too cute in terms of couponing and multi-buys and then move to the rest of your store and do that really well, because there is a lot of gold to mine on the hard goods and soft goods sides of the store. So by over managing, that’s what I mean. I don’t want to say much more about that, because you just can’t leave it alone. It won’t run itself. But I think we’re recognizing that we want to be able to protect our food margin, be price competitive in the market, but spend our time on the selling floor. And if you put more fraction to your store by the way, then, of course, that brings more management. So we had a produce initiative. It was okay. We drove some good produce comps, but we weren’t seeing the basket fill up on this side of the store, where there’s more money being made in the produce, is not the – a margin play that it would be in a supermarket, because we only have the best sellers. So it helped against the lower base. But, I think, again, it took a lot of management time to make that produce work well. And we have to be very, very honest about whether it was a limited time on the managers day or they should be getting their sales. So without – I could go on with a few more examples, as this is pretty granular, I know, but you – just to give you a flavor of how that shift might look going forward.', 'Stephen MacLeod', 'Okay. That’s really helpful. So would you expect then that you would be moving away from fresh meat and more to…', 'Edward Kennedy', 'We’re looking at de-skewing the stores that are – some stores will get out of it, but some will be de-skewed in terms of higher shrink items and certain cuts that just aren’t carrying their weight. So simplify it further, making that call store-by-store. On the produce side, it’s about saying, \"Okay, are we – how much labor can we put into this department? Can we make it simpler? And maybe, we are being too – or the bargain side is too high given the labor we have to put into it and the attention it requires from the store manager. So it’s – some of these things, you just don’t – you don’t go to the other side of the ditch, but it’s – it literally comes down to how many hours of the manager’s time is involved in this and then looking to take a hard, hard look at shrink, because that’s another point that’s been really disappointing as the shrink that we’ve taken in food. We should not have done that. I mean, there’s some risk you’ve got to take. But if I look at it cumulatively, at our year-to-date shrink, it’s just unacceptable. So if I go and find where the culprits are, they were all walking around in the produce and the meat department.', 'Stephen MacLeod', 'Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'We’ll move to the next caller in the queue. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'It’s Van Aelst. Again few more questions. So are you going to quantify at all, like, how much of an impact the markdowns at Giant Tiger had on EBITDA?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'I don’t think I want to break out the variances inside of the Giant Tiger. I mean it’s – we don’t do it in totality, never mind within, but we’ve highlighted the key factors that affected performance at Giant Tiger. And then it’s – in aggregate, it affected our overall performance, but I won’t – I don’t want to get into each of these.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Alright. St. Thomas, is that store still on schedule to open in Q4?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes. I think it’s November – I’m not really sure whether we’ve announced it in the market. I don’t think we have, but it’s opening in Q4. Opening in early Q4, put it that way.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'And then you talk about, also in the strategy section, about optimizing your air cargo capabilities. So what’s left to do now that you’ve got a lot of the stuff going to Harriston here and you guys have capacity up?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Sure. I’ll just take a couple of minutes on that. I think, the – there’s a lot to do as it turns out. We’ve – we keep turning over ideas and one is the, I’ve talked before, it’s more seamless integration where plane-ready pallets go right on the plane, right off the plane. We’re looking at – I would just say, without – because some of the stuff is quite innovative and we don’t want to talk about it that way specifically, but a big factor for us is optimizing the weight on the plane. And it’s just – the point we’d say is that when it’s a third-party carrier, the weight is not their problem, it’s your problem, they charge by it. And the collaboration to optimize is not – there is no unnatural incentive for that because you pay and the – but they charge you and you’re figuring out stuff from a different lens. So we’ve just had this hammered home through the airline actually, and they’ve got very strong people letting us know how this works. And we’ve got some ideas that we’re working on, that I think are innovative. They could have a major impact. I’d like to talk more about them, as we roll them out. I think that what we’re doing is completely lined up with building a superior air cargo capability. And I’ll just stay on this point that no one is doing this in Northern Canada, while Cargojet, of course, is a pretty successful cargo airline in the South. In Alaska, you do see dedicated cargo carriers, some are multimodal, like Lynden Transport, is air, road and water. And it’s just the power of focus that we’re starting to take advantage of. So I apologize for being general, but I don’t want to be more specific for almost competitive reasons.', 'The other point I want to make, it was not your question, but I think, I better – I want to bring it up and that is that as we look at air cargo and the size of our business, so we’ve moved over to Northwest 100% of the cargo in Northwest, Ontario, Manitoba and regions of Nunavut with the exception of just some communities in Baffin Island. We used a Cargojet plane to fly freight from Winnipeg to Iqaluit as well, which is a big road for us. So now, here we are, and now we’re – your question was about optimization. Scale is another factor on our minds, and it was always there. And we talked about further phasing and what I’m describing about cargo growth is now third-party cargo growth, but there’s another point to this. We had a plane and we didn’t – it wasn’t material. But I’m going to – so last year, we had some account situation with the ATRs and trying to figure out how to move from a third-party maintenance to an in-house capacity, dealing with all that disruption. This year, we had a plane that had an emergency landing in a lake, not an ATR, one of the Baslers. That plane is actually out of the lake, toed back to the airport and down in Wisconsin at the Basler factory, getting retrofitted. It should be back in the air within 30 days. But it is out of the air. It was in the water for a few weeks, for 4 months. So what, well, we’ve covered off the fleet, covered that off, the quarter was pretty good, but it’s tenuous in the sense that if we had another plane issue, it’s not a big fleet. So bigger is better for efficiency or redundancy risk mitigation and for growth, because we see the north is very, very active for cargo needs, both sealift cargo and air. So we’re exploring different ways to grow the cargo business for all of those reasons. It’s not a dire situation in terms of, are we just upside down on our fleet size, but seeing how this plays out, and I – and by the way, the efficiency improvements that I’ve – didn’t get into detail on, are really important, because if you think about weight and the number of – likes it cuts in – it improves the efficiency of the planes, so you can use fundamentally less aircraft. But if an aircraft is down, that’s just a risk that we’ve got to be able to model out and make sure that we’ve got capacity to cover it off. And again, and that – against that backdrop is that there aren’t a lot of planes just hanging around that you can call up. But it used to be like that according to the very experienced folks who run an airline, but it’s not as easy today. So you better have some of your own equipment then you can reposition and make sure it’s there to carry the North West freight or wherever your customers are to live up to your standards of performance. So that’s also something that we’re looking at in the airline.', 'Now, you can say, what is that from a forecast standpoint? It may have some capital investment implications, but it would be for the right reasons to grow the business. This is not defensive, like, what I’m talking about is to grow profitably, but also in a way that reduces the risk of your current size. And we’re having those discussions. We’re planning that with the team. It’s all part of the long-range plan anyways that we would go to third-party customers and add capacity, but having seen now just over a year of some risk that did us, some that could’ve, I am more convinced than ever that we need to be bigger for all those reasons.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Okay. I saw that the Amazon made an investment in Cargojet, so does this – do you see this getting Amazon into Northern Canada in a more efficient way? And will they become a competitor, again, in some of these markets?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'I don’t think so. I think the Iqaluit road today where money is being lost by someone in buckets through the Amazon prime membership, there’s probably millions of freight dollars being absorbed by someone, I mean, Amazon [indiscernible], I don’t know, who exactly. That model won’t be replicated across the rest of the Northern Canada. The Iqaluit is a bit exceptional, because it has frequency that is justified by the size of the market. When you get in the smaller markets, frequency does drop off, but we’re doing twice-a-week service. We think that’s sufficient – sorry sufficient and efficient. And you can over service the community and it will be tough economically, and doesn’t really – and isn’t sustainable. So when you get into the size of communities we serve, and you move to an e-com model and, believe me, as you would expect, we’re always modeling this. If we don’t – it’s not like we have dealers who don’t want e-com, we’ll do whatever the customers’ need that works for them, but the frequency part comes up again and again. There’s only so much you can do on a frequency basis, and then there’s the perish ability of the product when it gets to the community, where is it going to go next, etcetera. So there is challenges to the model and then it bucks up against the way our customers actually shop. And psycho-graphically, when you look at that who shops e-com, it’s not our customer. So our goal is to drive down costs. And we don’t want to – it’s not that we’re not tied to legacy bricks and mortar we want to lean out our bricks and mortar as much as possible and get our costs continually down still with the margins that we need to get a return, but grow our share in the North. And keep testing and modeling with the customer, like, will they forward-buy, will they pantry load, if their homes are tight, overcrowded actually, where does the food going to go? And if you don’t have the economic capacity to forward-buy it, then our job is to get you the best deal through the bricks and mortar or some combination of it. So I think the – we are watching what’s going on with Amazon and never take them for granted. But you can overreact to this, too. So we want to be the best. And I think the other way is to look at this, if you look at the value chain of North West, and I tried to get into a bit of the AGM and so your plan, buy, move and sell, the retail value chain, we have been increasingly breaking it down within plan, buy, move and sell. The sell, we feel we have to continue to own, although we could model different compensation and quasi-ownership franchise models with our stores I talked about decentralization, localization, but we – that’s, that’s IT, that’s competitive advantage for North West. On the move, the outbound move, you’ve heard that before, that is the vertical investment in United States, that’s a very important differentiator. There’s a lot of spend in that part of the value chain that you can scale relative to anybody else, actually. When you get to the inbound in the distribution, that’s scalable that we – that’s a scale that we can achieve to get to an efficient DC, the amount of volume you need to get to automation, robotics and in the inbound side containers from China, that’s not where we are going to – that’s very outsource able for us with the right partner. So you go through it. Then you go to the plan and buy. On the plan side, obviously, we should know what people are buying and want to live with in the North. That’s unique lifestyle needs. But broad trend, i.e. bicycles, we’ve got to buy it from someone else. So our goal on the, what I call, broad trend buying is to get together with somebody, whether it’s Giant Tiger, Canadian Tire, Home Hardware. Today, we use some distributors. Our goal is to talk to essentially non-competing retailers and try to strike the right arrangement on the pure buy side, because we’ll never match the scale. We could localize it into the right communities in the right quantities. So we take apart each of those parts of our value chain. We’re looking at what do we do ourselves, what’s down the road do we partner with others on and certainly, the air cargo was one that we want to do ourselves.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'And just one last, hopefully, short question, I think in the last quarter conference call, you hinted that you are looking to get a better deal with Giant Tiger East. I’m not sure if I misunderstood you or not. But can – if that’s the case, can you give us any update on that?', 'Edward Kennedy', 'Yes. I don’t – I am sure I didn’t say better deal just like that. But the point there is to have good discussions with Giant Tiger that lead to something or go a different direction. And I alluded to Giant Tiger’s got some very good assortments that could work in the North. There were other retailers that we could – we can take their mix into the North, including – and the Caribbean actually. So it’s trying to actually lean into GT in the way that we’re paying the royalties for, as they support our business, that they want us to win, not just collecting the royalties, of course. But they have a very strong stake, I think, in the brand and what’s being developed in Western Canada and what can still be developed. So it’s just having a very good connection with them. They’ve – and it’s been okay, I mean, we now have a new President at Giant Tiger, as of August 1, and we’ve had some good discussions. So I’m hoping that we can get more action plans in place. We’re not the only thing they deal, of course, they’ve got other markets in Canada, but it’s more optimizing the relationship for both sides. And we both have scale that we can share potentially. These are the things that we’re exploring and we will see where that goes. But it’s – that’s, kind of, the waterfront of our discussions right now.', 'Michael Van Aelst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'At this time, there are no additional callers in the queue. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kennedy for any additional or closing comments.', 'Edward Kennedy', 'I don’t have any additional comments.

Crystal?\", 'Shelley Xu', 'Thank you, Ralph, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in ReneSola. To get started, we will provide a summary of our second quarter financial performance, and review our operating highlights. The call will then go to our CFO, Xiaoliang Liang, who will cover financial results in more detail, and he will update 2019 guidance. We will then open the call to questions.', 'I am very pleased with our second quarter results. Business momentum was solid, and we executed well relative to our expectations. Revenue of $13.6 million, grew 4% sequentially, and was above the high end of our guidance range.', 'Our better-than-expected topline, excellent gross margin and the prudent spending resulted in an operating margin of 52%. Importantly, after two consecutive quarters of losses, we returned to profitability. We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of approximately $8.7 million. Mr. Liang will go over the details of our financial results later in the call.', \"We continue to make solid operating progress in Q2. We successfully connected a total 37 megawatts projects in several jurisdictions. We signed a development service agreement with X-Elio in North America to develop large utility scale solar projects in the U.S., and we sold two project companies in China, including 10 rooftop DG projects with a combined capacity of 12 megawatts. Overall, we had a lot going on in this quarter and we’re encouraged by the progress we've made.\", 'I will now provide an update on our project pipeline. Our project pipeline remains quite strong at 1.4 gigawatts, of which 714 megawatt is late stage. This late-stage pipeline is geographically diversified, which spread across different countries, as listed on Slide 3. Approximately 34 megawatt of the late-stage is under construction.', 'As I mentioned earlier, in Q2, we connected a total 37-megawatt projects in several geographies, including the U.S., Poland, China, and Canada. In addition to our development pipeline, we currently own and operate 241-megawatt portfolio of solar projects that generates high-margin recurring revenue.', 'As highlighted on Slide 3, our operating asset include 201-megawatt of rooftop in China, 20 megawatt of utility solar in the U.S, 15 megawatt of ground mount in Romania, and 4 megawatt of rooftop in the U.K. Looking ahead, we have approximately 5 megawatt of rooftop projects under construction in China.', 'Now, let me review the various geographies in more detail. First, China. As shown on Slide 6, we operate approximately 201 megawatts of rooftop solar, concentrated in multiple Eastern provinces with favorable development environments.', 'Self-consumption DG projects in those provinces are attractive investments. As we evolve and transform into an asset-light solar project developer, we are on track to monetize our China DG assets enabling us to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce leverage, and improved cash flow. We plan to use the cash to develop more high margin solar projects.', 'By the way, as we discussed on our last call, we’ve submitted applications for subsidies for our residential DG projects to the NEA ahead of the July 1 deadline. We have been awarded a total of 10.2 megawatt of projects.', \"For those projects awarded, the subsidy price is RMB0.05 per kilowatt hour. This is a positive development for ReneSola. We're optimistic about the current environment, and we remain focused on rapidly developing new DG projects in China.\", 'Next, let’s turn our attention to the U.S. As highlighted on Slide 7, our late-stage projects stand at around 307 megawatts, of which 107 megawatt of community solar in Minnesota and in New York.', 'Additionally, we have small utility-scale projects with the mix of corporate, municipal and the utility off-takers in other states including Utah, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and in California. Of the late stage projects, 4.5 megawatt are under construction and expected to grid connect in Q3.', 'As discussed on our last earnings call, we entered into a development service agreement with X-Elio, North America, that specializes in the development, construction, operation and the maintenance of solar plants. Our team will originate and develop large utility-scale solar projects for X-Elio. We will assist X-Elio in obtaining site control, permitting, interconnection and offtake agreements. We will also support their projects through the financing and in construction phases.', 'This contract with X-Elio is a key milestone in our company’s history, as it demonstrates our ability to leverage our development platform and capability to support our customer needs. Longer term, this also could open up potential opportunities to engage with other project developers and operators as well.', 'We have an excellent team in place and a solid track record of developing solar projects globally. We believe, we’re in a great position to add tremendous value and help them expand their presence in the U.S.', 'In Canada, we’ve connected 0.6 megawatt of FIT DG projects in Q2. We now have 2.7-megawatt of late-stage projects, all of which are under construction and should connect to the grid in Q3. As we alluded to you on our last earnings call, we’ve connected 11-megawatt of DG projects in Poland in Q2.', 'Slide 9 shows that we now have a total of 26 megawatt in development stage. The 26 megawatt individual projects are the projects awarded to us in the government auction in 2018. Additionally, our key asset in Poland is a portfolio of 55 installations of 1 megawatt each, all of which are completed, operating, and up for sale.', 'Slide 10 shows Hungary, where we invest in small scale DG projects. Our late stage pipeline has more than 67 micro projects, each with a size of 1.5 megawatt, bringing total capacity to approximately 34 megawatt. Of the late stage projects, 21 megawatt are under construction and expected to be connected to the grid in Q4 or Q1 2020.', 'Moving on to India, on Slide 11. We have 50 megawatt in our project pipeline. Most projects there are ground-mounted, open access projects. Our strategy there is to implement a pure project developer model. We develop projects to the shovel-ready stage and then sell the project rights to investors.', \"Now, please turn to Slide 12, where we cover other regions. In France, we've formed a strategic partnership with Green City Energy last year to co-develop four solar parks in the South, with a total installed capacity of 69 megawatt. We expect COD for the parks in 2020 or 2021.\", 'We are also pursuing opportunities in other international markets, including Spain, South Korea and the Vietnam. In Spain, we have a late stage pipeline of 12 megawatt of private PPA projects. And in South Korea, we secured a 9 megawatt ground-mounted project. In Vietnam, we obtained the land rights for 200 megawatt ground-mounted project.', 'In summary, we have a globally diversified project portfolio, spanning multiple stages in both rooftop and the ground mount. And I am positive on opportunities ahead of us. The global solar power project development business is large, and it continues to grow. We’re becoming a leading global project developer by focusing on high quality projects in the attractive regions.', 'Before I turn the call over to Mr. Liang, I will like to discuss the proposed investment by Shah Capital, as outlined in the press release, we put out earlier today. Last week, our major shareholder, Shah Capital tentatively agreed to terms for the purchase of newly issued shares. The term sheet contemplated Shah Capital purchasing 100 million ordinary shares at to the price of US$0.11 per share, for a total consideration of US$11 million.', 'The purchase price of $0.11 per share is equivalent to $1.10 per ADS, which represents an approximately 12% premium based on the average closing price in the last 30 trading days. The completion of the transaction will be contingent on customary closing conditions.', 'We believe, this proposed strategic investment can provide an important capital infusion for ReneSola, enabling us to further execute our downstream project development trend globally.', 'With that, let me now turn the call over to Mr. Liang for comments on our financial performance. Mr. Liang?', 'Xiaoliang Liang', 'Thank you, Crystal. Thank you, Shelley. And thank everyone for joining us on the call today. I will review our financial performance for the second quarter 2019 and then discuss our outlook.', 'Please turn to Slide 14. Revenue was $13.6 million, up 4% sequentially and down 51% year-over-year. Q2 revenue exceeded our guidance range of $10 million to $12 million.', \"Breaking out our revenue by segment. Project development was $3.9 million. This was largely driven by the recognition of remaining $3.1 million from the 26.1 megawatts of U.K. projects, that was sold in 2016 and the terms of the sales agreement, we signed in 2016, the final acceptance certificate passed on these projects would commence 2 years after the agreement was signed. We've successfully completed the test in Q2 2019. As a result, we’ve recognized the remaining portion of that project revenue.\", 'IPP electricity sales were $9.7 million, mainly from the 61.7 million kilowatt hours of electricity generated by our operating DG project in China. Gross margin - gross profit was $10.5 million, up from $0.4 million last quarter and up from $8.2 million in the same quarter last year.', 'Gross margin was 77%, which was significantly ahead of our expectations of 55% to 65%. This compares to 3% last quarter and 30% a year ago. The increase in gross margin was due to the revenue mix shift towards high margin IPP electricity sales.', 'Operating income was $7.1 million, compared to operating loss of $2.1 million last quarter. Operating margin was 52%, compared to negative 16% in Q1. Operating expenses were $3.4 million, up 38% sequentially, and up 48% year-over-year. The increase was due to the accretion of bad debt expense, likely uncollectible receivables.', 'Sales and the marketing expenses were $77,000, up from $23,000 last quarter and down from $173,000 in the same quarter last year.', 'General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million, up slightly from $2.3 million last quarter and essentially flat when compared to the same period last year. General and administrative expenses of $2.7 million were up sequentially due to an account receivable right-off of $0.89 million.', 'Excluding the right-off, the G&A expenses would have been down quarter-over-quarter. Below the line, non-operating expenses totaled $0.5 million, down from $3.4 million last quarter.', 'Q2 non-operating items include interest expense of $2.4 million and foreign exchange gain of $1.7 million. The ForEx gain was mainly due to appreciation of the Romanian leu against the euro.', 'Net income was $5.1 million or $0.01 per share compared to net loss of $5.4 million or $0.01 per share last quarter. EBITDA was positive $10.6 million, compared to negative $1 million in the previous quarter.', 'Now the balance sheet, shown on Slide 15. We had cash and equivalents of $8.7 million as of June 30, 2019, an increase of $1.7 million during the quarter. Long-term borrowings were approximately $10.7 million, as of June 30, 2019, which was largely flat when compared to the first quarter.', 'We have long-term liabilities related to failed leaseback and lease liabilities of approximately $78.7 million, a decrease of $7.4 million during the quarter. This relates mainly to rooftop projects in China.', 'Finally, let’s turn our attention to guidance shown on Slide 18. For 2019, we continue to expect the revenue to be in the range of $150 million to $170 million and the overall gross margin in the range of 20% to 25%. We anticipate meaningful revenue growth in the second half relative to the first half of 2019, as we expect the significant revenue contribution from project sales.', 'For the third quarter of 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $15 million to $20 million and gross margin in the range of 35% to 40%. Gross margin will be well below Q2 due to the revenue shift back to project sales.', 'With that, we would now like to open up the call for any questions that you may have for us. Operator, please go ahead.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have questions from the line of Philip Shen from Roth Capital Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Philip Shen', 'Hi. Thank you for taking for taking the questions. Shelley, congratulations on your new role. For your guidance, I think, you have $160 million as a midpoint for revenue for the full year 2019, and given your Q3 guidance of $18 million and what you did in the first half, the implied Q4 revenue guidance is, I believe, $116 million. How realistic is this? And how do you expect to - in which projects do you expect the sale in Q4? And are those projects on track? Thanks.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Please allow me to translate', 'Shelley Xu', '[Foreign Language] Okay. So please allow me to translate on behalf - for Shelley. Now we are entering into sales for Poland project and the Hungary project. So at this point, we estimate we can fulfill around 70% to 80% of our forecast.', 'Philip Shen', 'So, when you say 70% to 80% of your forecast, which forecast are you talking about? Is that the $160 million revenue guidance? Do you think you can be 70% to 80% of that $160 million or are you talking about 75% of the Poland, Hungary sales, expecting?', 'Shelley Xu', \"[Foreign Language] We were referring to the $160 million revenue, the 70% to 80% of that, and that's all highly dependent on the two sales we mentioned before, which are expected to complete in Q4.\", 'Philip Shen', 'Okay. Just to be clear, the 70% to 80% is on the $116 million, expected in Q4, or is it on the $160 million for the full year?', 'Shelley Xu', '[Foreign Language] Okay. So on the – we’re talking about project size. Our forecast is 270 megawatt, right? And we are confident that we can achieve 70% to 80% of that 270 megawatt.', \"And when we talk about sales revenue of $160 million and - we are also confident that we should be able to perform as - between the range of $150 million and $170 million, that's the range we provided.\", 'Philip Shen', \"Okay. So the 70% to 80% of your forecast, is that -- I'm still a bit confused because she said, 70% to 80% of something, right? So is that on - what is that applied to? And I know you're confident around $160 million.\", 'But what you just said, you think 70% to 80% of the 270 megawatts, so did you need that 270 megawatts to hit your $160 million before or do you only need 70% to 80% of your 270 megawatts to hit your $160 million of revenue guidance?', 'Shelley Xu', \"[Foreign Language] Yes. Okay. So just to be clear, we have - we've forecasted the total like annual. So we are confident that we can complete - we can - for 2019 forecast, we are confident we can complete 70% to 80% of the 270 megawatt, which is around 200 megawatt, right? \", \"And it's highly dependent on the Q4 performance to determine whether we can achieve that 200 megawatts. So, the current revenue, which reflects the 200 megawatts would be around 1.4 - will be around $140 million.\", 'Philip Shen', 'Okay. So the - if you do 200 megawatts, then that implies $140 million of revenue for the full year? So...', 'Shelley Xu', 'Correct. Yes.', 'Philip Shen', \"So you’re confident around the $140 million. You're more confident around that than your prior guidance, it seems like, so - okay. Let's move on to - so in order to reach the 200 megawatts, because, I believe, in the first half, you only sold 36 megawatts, right? 24 megawatts in Q1, 12 megawatts in Q2, so you’ve 36 megawatts in the first half, okay? So, that would imply 164 megawatts in the back half. What is the split between Q3 and Q4 of that 164 megawatts? And what projects specifically - yes, go ahead…\", 'Shelley Xu', '[Foreign Language] ', 'Philip Shen', 'Hello, are you guys still there?', 'Shelley Xu', '[Foreign Language] Yes. So we think the rest of the - the forecast is 200, and we have sold 31 in the first half year - 36 in the first half year, and we think the rest will be sold in Q3 and Q4.', 'Now as the - including the sale of Poland projects of 55 megawatt and Hungary project of 13.9 megawatt. And also include several projects in U.S. and in Korea.', 'Philip Shen', \"Okay. That's very helpful. Was there another piece to translate?\", 'Shelley Xu', \"No. That's it.\", 'Philip Shen', 'Okay. Thank you. And then you changed your total pipeline, I think, it was reduced to 714 megawatts from Q1 of 753 megawatts. Can you talk about the major additions and major subtractions to result in the net change of about 40 megawatts?', 'Shelley Xu', 'Please allow us a second for discussions. Hold on, please.', 'Philip Shen', 'Okay.', 'Shelley Xu', '[Foreign Language] So the decrease in our late-stage pipeline was mainly due to the completion of construction of those projects, and we moved them into operating assets.', 'Philip Shen', 'Okay. Great. And one final question. How much of your late stage pipeline do you believe does not require a subsidy?', 'Shelley Xu', \"[Foreign Language] So except for the projects in China, all the rest projects usually doesn't need a subsidy.\", 'Philip Shen', \"So the U.S., I would define as a subsidized country, because they have the investment tax credits. And then if there’s a country that gives you a feed in tariff that is above market rates or pretty high, I wouldn’t believe that that's also a subsidized market. So if you take that into consideration, what percentage do you think maybe only subsidized?\", 'Shelley Xu', \"[Foreign Language] Okay. This shouldn't - it shouldn’t be a large part of our current pipeline. And also we think that, that's a totally different definition of subsidy for those, kind of, subsidies and the subsidies we’re talking about in China. So it needs to be looked into case-by-case.\", 'Philip Shen', 'Okay. Thank you very much for taking the time for all the questions. I’ll pass then.', 'Shelley Xu', 'Okay. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you for the questions. [Operator Instructions] There are no more questions from the line. I’d like to hand the call back to management for any closing remarks.', 'Shelley Xu', 'Okay. Thank you, operator. Okay, we are pleased with our Q2 results that reflect our continued execution of our project development strategy. We are optimistic about our opportunities and look forward to updating you on our business progress in a few months. Thank you, again, for your participation. This concludes our call today.

As always, if you have questions, raise your hand, we’ll get a mic to you towards the end because there are people on the webcast. ', \"And with that Rich, thank you for kicking it off this morning. At the risk of you not commenting a bunch on it, I’ll start the same way I've started with a bunch of other companies, the macro environment and the trade environment has clearly had an impact on the semiconductor industry as a whole. So with TI being the largest analog player in the world, I just wanted to get a read from you on how you are viewing the macro situation today versus say at the beginning of the year. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah Ross, as [inaudible] we’re really getting going this morning. Really no different than what you heard from Dave and Rafael on the July earnings call. We came off a strong ‘17 and ’18, you saw things slow in a different part of ’18, so you've got a semiconductor, pretty classic semiconductor cycle working its way through in a pretty orderly fashion, and then put on top of that, the uncertainty due to trade and the good news is we are going to make a forecast [indiscernible], so we are prepared to deal with whatever 2020 wants to deliver on that front. \", 'Ross Seymore', \"And what you guys think of the duration of the downturn. Dave on all the calls has been, and Rafael have been very consistent saying historically a typical downturn is four to five quarters of negative comps and you guys have been saying that since the beginning of this one. Another way to look at it is the shape of the recovery and some of the definition of the downturn is not just year-over-year being down, but also kind of sub-seasonality. When we come out of this, how do you judge what the shape is likely to be and what sort of strategic steps the TI makes to prepare for either the bonanza side of things or something that's a little more muted. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah, you know I’m on – I think this now you know of cycle 10 and almost for 40 years in the business and there is no predictable pattern of what will it look like and so you know you have watched us over the years as well. When you see things slow, get the operating plans right, you know get the inventories right, make sure replenishing, and make sure you can handle any combinations that you know could show up, be it slow or drawn out, because there's a macro issue on top or if people have over compensated, ‘09 was probably the best example. They turned down so hard, it was really a strong snap back, but clearly this one is deeper than ‘14 and ‘15, but nowhere near the deficits we saw back in ’09, which is a great expectation. So we’ll just make sure that we’re able to handle whatever they want it to be. \", 'Ross Seymore', \"And the last question on a macro side, somewhat as more on the trade side with Huawei. You guys I think in your last call talked about adhering to all the rules of course, stopping shipping and then restarting it. Talk a little bit about how you are able to ship, just because we've heard from so many different companies that have given us so many different answers on who can ship and why. So what allows TI to be able to ship its products? \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah, you know I think it's very much and you said it well. We make sure – I think many of the companies, all make sure that you are abiding by the letter of the law and make sure you understand what the terms are and then once you get done looking at that versus the products, okay you could move forward. And so you know we did that through look and were able to make those dispositions and resumed, I forget if it was three or four weeks after you know that May cut-off on that front. \", \"And I think you've heard when I just listened to other company, you know both the earnings and in general, I think everybody's you know followed it pretty much at the same way. So I think it will depend on your product mix more than anything. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Really had for some companies a temporary disruption in the demand patterns, but it also has had some differing impacts on the supply side of things. Have you noticed any difference in the amount of channel inventory people are holding for fear of that, and has that adjusted anything as far as how you guys are addressing this, [shrinking part] of your business that goes to the channel? ', 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah, I'm careful and I think you've heard this again from Dave for many years, no one will ever say they've seen inventories built up until the day demand is not as high and then they say oops, you know inventories are built up. We don't see anything that stands out on that, but I am also careful of back to that first comment of thinking you have that much insight into it.\", \"We are advantaged as you know quite well and you talked about it. Because we've been aggressive with the consignment, because we keep a lot of that in our hands or on our books and you watch the days that we actually have in the channel be lower than, say any of our competitors. Even if it's up, it’s not going to be something that mixes us up too badly. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'So you mentioned about the consignment side of things. So why don’t we pivot to a more TI specific comment and topic. I think you’ve said about two-thirds of your revenue runs through consignment these days and two-thirds of the – if the revenue goes through. Why did you make the original decision to change more to consignment? ', 'Rich Templeton', \"So I think the – it's probably more helpful to back up as opposed to a consignment or distribution only, go back and think about the commentary you hear from us of really trying to build a business model centered on four competitive advantages: manufacturing, technology, breadth of our products, reach of our channel and diversity and longevity. And we're very, very consistent on that. We either want to be building those advantages stronger or leveraging. \", \"And so if you think about the reach that we have in terms of the channel, we have always had a long term belief that building closer direct relationships with our customers really was going to be a helpful thing for the long term. So think about the things that you've watched: consignment inventory, changes in distribution registration programs, whatever it was five, six, seven years ago, continuing to build our strength in our sales force, building mass market sales teams, investments in TI.com, many of the things you’ve talked about for years when you visited and we’ve got together, and so to me this is all part of just to continuum of evolving forward and it’s just very logical. \", 'We are going to be better served of inventories in one place and we are going to be better served when we can truly see the demand of the true end customer.', \"And that way you eliminate the buffering or the buffering of buffering, a lack of visibility of what true demand is, and it's going to let us run the business better and I think do a better job for our customers in the long term. \", \"So to me the consignment efforts, the latest phase that we are working through now, are just part of that, you know evolution of us getting closer to our customers and it's going to have a lot of advantages long term. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Were there any negatives on the revenue side, in making that transition? ', 'Rich Templeton', \"Sure. I think Rafael talked about it in the last call that you know when you bring down, recognize revenue that’s an inventory outlet channel and you are moving it internal, you will have a temporary, okay its actually in some ways you would say permanent that you are bringing that revenue down. But you know to me it just gets closer to what the consumption is and that's always a good thing as well. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Do you believe any of the reach benefits that the distribution partners would claim as a strategic advantage of using them as something that you sacrifice or is TI scale a unique offset to that? ', 'Rich Templeton', 'You know look at the – you know when you narrated some of the debate, I think back five and six years ago when we stopped the design registration, we said they just don’t have influence and look at what our market share has done and especially mass markets like industrial and its only gone in one direction since then. ', \"And so -- and we're uniquely, that's not a statement for everybody in the semiconductor industry, we have it because we plan for that, built out a sales force, we build out an applications team, we've built our capabilities on TI.com and as a result of that we can do a better job taking care of our customers directly. \", \"In the end customers just want the work done efficiently and cost effectively, and when it comes to selecting components and getting them into production, ramping them, they'd rather do that directly with the suppliers and we are in a position to build and do that. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Would you believe aggregate inventory, what we see on your books and what you see as in the channel has really changed much during this evolution or is it just more internal, less external and it’s the same overall. ', 'A - Rich Templeton', \"Probably hasn't changed that much. I'm careful because I haven't done, got some calculations on that, but I think the more interesting question longer term is when we get to the other side of all these transitions, is it going to let us be even more efficient, because we have things in one place that we can support customers throughout the world from that, you know one centralized area meeting. They will give great lead-times, great availability, you know great service so we can react to customers. I've got a feeling we can be pretty efficient doing that, but it’s a little early to make a projection on that. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'And when you get to the other side, is the other side defined by that final third of the business, being consignment as well. So there is really no channel so to speak or is there some balance between the two at the end stage. ', 'Rich Templeton', \"No, I think there is always, you know when it comes to channels, customers are the ones that need to be able to make decisions on what they want to do. We just want to make sure they have a really good option of – if they can do business directly with us, it will be something we support and they'll see advantages in it and if they choose to do that, then that’s how we’ll support them long term. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'And do you think, especially in the analog market, that products have very long life cycles, obsolete capability of risk. Is there such a thing as caring too much inventory? ', 'Rich Templeton', \"No. If you look at – you know and we’ve seen it and I don’t care if it’s the TI product lines, you can go back to the Burr-Brown acquisitions, the UNITRD acquisitions, both the products from National, you do great analog parts. These things are around for 10, 15, 20, 25 years and so that ability to be very calculated on how you manage inventory internally when you've got standard products that many customers use, you know what five years of run rate of consumption looks like, it lets you actually be very thoughtful in terms of some combination of die-bank/finished goods, produce great service metrics, but also have very low risk of obsolescence. \", \"Now that’s different than if you're in you know big customer, big vertical, custom market where you know a device is built for only one customer, that’s a very different you know world you have to play around. This one we're going towards I think it’s going to be a very good one. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'If we looked at TI down the road, the consignment is probably higher in the mix of those more fragmented customers would be higher, larger customers lower and that the whole industrial automotive focus is better. ', \"Another key part of this is manufacturing side. I guess we are one of the first to go to the – if not the first, to go to 300 millimeter. Right now you look like you are moving to the next phase of that. Talk a little bit about the next move to 300 millimeters. I think you've talked about within the next few years was the discussion you signed to do that expansion down in Texas and then it seems like it's not going to be this year, it'll be sometime after. Has anything changed in the timing of that due to demand or is it just this is the progression it takes to roll out with taxes, all the sorts of jurisdictions. \", 'Rich Templeton', 'Ross you have seen us in the past and think about prior generations away for fed. You know we qualified our FAB 1 clean room. I think it was 2007 and we didn’t tool it and ramp it up until late 2009, 2010. And you know the clean room is not cheap, but it actually is compared to when you put all the capital and people in it and so that flexibility, you’re not being worried about having a clean room a few years early is just not something that has bothered me and it won’t bother me for the cycle and you go back to even DMOS6 back in 1996 with we put that one in. ', \"But you know we’ll be in a position and I'm going to guess that if we have to ramp that thing by 2021 or the end of 2021 we’ll be a position to do that. You know you can apply any growth what if scenarios to where we are and figure out, do we need to buy 2121 or 2024, that's all close enough as far as I'm concerned.\", 'I do like the fact and I think you can appreciate this, that by having it next to an existing facility, the granularity of the capacity additions and the staffing additions put us in a position to be very responsive to demand, where if you go build at a Greenfield site, you will essentially have to tool with a third of that factory to get it even running. ', 'Well, if it’s sitting right next to an existing one, you can add critical tools for that new facility and deal with your capacity and the incremental cost is actually very proportionate to the revenue. So I think it also puts us in a position to be very responsive with fixed costs as we bring that thing online. ', 'Ross Seymore', 'One aspect of the fixed cost that you guys have been very opportunistic on with the fab years past is selling used equipment and downturns have been useful in that regard. ', 'Rich Templeton', 'You have to enjoy life. ', 'Ross Seymore', 'Exactly! Is that occurring right now or is the equipment still free, because it seems like everything is still too tight. ', 'Rich Templeton', \"You know it’s one of these things that you know when you get asked questions of will there be excess equipment? Yes, there will be. You know the investors will probably be in a lousier mood when that time comes, but that's okay, we'll take advantage of it. \", \"So – and there's still some out there, there is just nowhere near what we saw back in 2009, 2010 and 2011 when we would pick it up from older equipment and do fab, you know a bunch from around the world, we can still do some now. But you know even I think it was at last year's Capital Management Call, Rafael basically said we're assuming a higher percent of new equipment for this next round and that doesn't mean it has to be that, it means we're assuming that. And if we can find used equipment because things soften up, then that's great, we'll bring it in. \", 'But the beauty behind this is we could have every dollar spent on new equipment and the incremental margin and pay back on 300 millimeter is stunning. The real impact economically is getting that way for diameter leverage. ', 'Ross Seymore', 'The last question on that manufacturing side of things, when you think of the 300 millimeter side, do you think the first benefit has been more to TI’s margins or market share? ', 'Rich Templeton', \"You know to keep life simple, it’s a margin answer, because you know in the end when you can get the dye costs down as you've seen the calculations by at least 40% and you’ve watched our fall-through on incremental revenue over the past four and five years and I think it’s reflected, the advantage of having that. So the majority of that is just the margin you can operate it at. \", \"Are there technical benefits of lithography and precision and speed and different parameters in the process, yes but it's at the margin. A little easier answer to that is, it’s a gross margin benefit. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'And actually, I missed out one last one on this. Some other companies have tried to obtained the 300 millimeter benefit often times with foundry. Have you noticed any change in the competitive environment, and as of that more pricing pressure from the competition or is it still a performance centric market. ', 'Rich Templeton', \"Its performance centric and I think more importantly as last time I checked, the Foundries aren’t terrible operations in terms of what they sell the wafers to folks that. So you look at the profitability of the foundry suppliers and you know – and that's the beauty of our model, is we press you know Kyle Flessner and his tem, we want you as cost effective or better than the foundries and then you've got the benefit of that plus no market, and it's a wonderful thing. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Let me pivot over to a little bit more in the competitive environment, but directly on to the M&A side of things. Back when I started following you guys 20 years ago, TI was one of the most active on M&A and the analog space. UNITRD and Burr-Brown and then a decade or so later you guys did national. But you really haven’t participated in this decade so much, choosing more to buy your own stock, instead of somebody else’s. So I guess a couple questions on that, has the competitive intensity changed as some of the scale has ramped up with some of the competition many years in ADIs of the world. ', 'Rich Templeton', \"You know and it's not to avoid this specific nature of that, as I take it more to – I think the past 10 and 15 years have been destructive and meaning, if you are a well-run semiconductor company, more focused on what you do well, less dabbling, we’ve certainly done that, but a number of other companies have as well. \", \"Is M&A part of that? I'd say yes it is, but in general and again, you followed the industry for 20 years; you’ve seen things from late 90s. You know low run companies have done a better job over the past 10 or 12 years, because it's a more constructive environment. It doesn't mean it's any less competitive, we’ve got good competitors, we go out and do battle with them on a daily basis, but the discipline in terms of R&D spending, in terms of capital spending, you just see a better disciplined industry compared to 20 years ago. \", 'My guess is the environment is going to continue that way for probably the next 10 and M&A is just part of that, not the majority of that is my guess. ', 'Ross Seymore', 'So you think it’s the natural maturing of the industry and people optimizing accordingly. ', 'Rich Templeton', 'You know, and again you’ve lived it. You’ve watched you know most investors in many companies in denial from the late 90s for 10 years of when are we are going to go back to 10% and 15% growth. You know the fact is the growth is more 5% or 6% or whatever you know number you want to apply and once people, you know get adjusted to that, you know things have you know I think got a little better discipline. ', 'Ross Seymore', \"Unless you talk about just, a year ago when people thought we're going to grow 10% or 15% then to. \", 'Rich Templeton', 'The new norm. ', 'Ross Seymore', \"Yeah, exactly. It hasn’t worked out so far for them, but… So do you think bigger is better in both analog and micro controllers? Is that scale – I know you believe it's a benefit to you, but others, you think it's one of the core tenets that you have, other people trying to emulate that, I would think, would something to competitive intensity. I know we just talked about it; it’s just a better behaved industry, but I'm surprised that you don't see it either microcontroller or the analog side or any different behavior. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah I think, you know the industries behave a little differently, but it's not because the scale or that other thing. \", \"Is bigger better? Yes to a degree, meaning you’ve got to get above certain minimums, okay. So if you think about the competitive advantages I mentioned earlier, the scale to be able to play a 300 millimeter internal game, it's hard to see even our largest analog competitors ever deciding to go back to that, so I'm going to guess they don't. \", \"The breadth of our product portfolio, even with M&A our largest, nearest competitors still can't dent what we do. The affordability of building out a sales and applications channel and reach okay, it's just not something that people are probably likely to do any day soon. So as long as you are above that level, scale really matters, but you know internally we spent a lot of time talking about how you build the operation stronger, you aim it at the best markets and the outcome is being bigger, as opposed to let me go get bigger. It doesn't get you to stronger places, but you do have to be you know at critical sizes to be above that. \", \"Part of the reason that we're so, you know I’m going to use the word confident in our competitive advantages is we've looked at greatly on how easy is it to replicate. And you know for somebody to really build out what we have built out, they probably got a goal to put two or three more companies together, let alone put together a wafer fab and an assembly test operation, let alone put together enterprise level processes that let them to operate that. That's a good backlog work to say the least. \", \"So I think it's difficult to replicate and I think we've seen that and I think our free – you know to me the ultimate test of your competitive advantages is does your free cash flow per share grow faster than your best competitors over the long term. And you know we've been able to do that for the past 10 or 15 years, real test is can you go do it for another 10. \", 'Ross Seymore', \"Only pivot off the M&A and the competition side of things and talk a little bit about the product strategy. Guys have narrowed things down over the years, big in analog and then microcontrollers as well. It seems like the microcontroller side you've decided to, but the analog commitment seems to be bigger than the MC and I might be over stating that. But talk about the relative importance of those two markets and why the growth rates seemingly have differed at times between the two. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"So I think there’s you know a couple of pieces inside. The highest level would really and I know its dangerous analogy, but you know which of your children do you love more and the answer is all of them, okay, and it's not just out of love and support. Its they can all contribute to the long term growth of free cash flow. \", \"So it's not – you know it’s for a very tangible reason. But I think the embedded business, which is a very different business than the analog business is one that can be successful and successful over the long term. Its financials will be different, look at margins and people ask well, are you going to – what does it take to get embedded up to analog margins. Well, we are not trying to press it, we are just trying to get it stronger each year and make sure it's growing and make sure it's contributing from a fall-through point of view. \", \"In the nearer term, meeting the past year or you know change when you've seen revenue growth differences between analog and embedded, we’ve historically seen differences. It's hard to go explain them all, is it customer mix, is it you know things happening in the channel. But I also think and again, you look at all these companies closer than I do; competitive microcontroller companies have been a little softer from a revenue point of view as well and so I don't think it's TI specific embedded trends on that. \", 'So my guess is, we keep track of that longer term, you know all these things will return to pretty parallel behaviors, because you know embedded was as you recall a great grower, late ’16, ’17 and ’18, heck it was growing better than analog during that timeframe for us, now it’s a little softer. ', 'Ross Seymore', \"Let me pivot. Well, about 10 minutes left, so if anybody does have a question raise your hands at this point where I'll keep my eyes open, but because there is so many hands going up right now, I'll make sure to continue with my question. \", \"So let’s pivot over to the end market side of things a bit. You for many, many years talked about the focus on the industrial analog market, but there's other high performance markets that people focus on that have been great drivers of growth and profitability and free cash flow etcetera, like the data center market and the common infrastructure market. How did you guys chose to do the industrial and auto versus things like the data center and comp side, when neither one has those kind of consumer behaviors that earlier you tend to avoid. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"That’s fair, but you know I go back and just think of the industry over 40 odd years and again, you’ve watched a lot of us, you had mainframes and min-computers that drove a great deal of the unit growth and market growth in the 60s and 70s. You moved into, in some ways communications at a phase, but if you really look at it, personal electronics, you know where there were 20, 30, 40 million units in the early 90s, there is 2.5 billion units annually between Smartphones, Tablets, PC's and whatever. \", \"But, you know you just have to sit back and say, over the next 20 years what's going to be the best secular growth opportunity and that doesn't mean we're not going to participate in com infrastructure, it’s an important market, it’s a good market, we're going to you know do better than our – you know hold our own on that, same in data center. \", \"But you know the opportunities of industrial and automotive are just different and you're going to sit back I believe 10 years from now or 20 years now and people are going to say, if you weren't in, you couldn’t play and you couldn't compete long term. And it's all for a very simple reason of a content story and that is if you take these, the end equipments that are mostly mechanical or a combination of electro mechanical, and you work to make them smarter, use less power, be safer, be earlier to use, you know pick your variable, what are you going to put inside that equipment, and I’ll put semiconductors on them. \", 'So I believe and I think the date is playing out that way even over the past five or six years for us. We are fortunately doing well in good markets and you know now our job is to make sure that you know we keep driving at that. The combination, I think industrial was up you know mid-30s, automotive up in low 20s, combination was above 55%, 56% last year and we keep pushing that up. ', 'Ross Seymore', \"And that’s exactly where I was going to go next. If I looked at TI five years down the road, do you think industrial, let's split him for now, but you could answer to together if you wish, but you think that combination is bigger and which one of the two do you think is going to be bigger percentage of TI five years from now relative to today. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Oh! I think the industrial is the biggest business today and is going to be the biggest business five years and 10 years from now. I think automotive will keep pace, okay, but those will grow larger. But we are also careful internally. We do not go around with a percent of business mix as a goal. As you give engineers that and they've got two variables they could mess with and we don’t want them messing with the other one. \", \"And so you know we want to hold our positions in personal electronics, we want to hold our positions in communications infrastructure and enterprise and then on top of that, we want to grow those absolute businesses in industrial and automotive. It’s what we’ve done for the past five years and is what we're challenging everybody internal to really double down on for the next five. \", 'Ross Seymore', \"When you mentioned that why you've targeted the industrial and automotive side, I think the automotive side people get the content argument, pretty obvious. \", 'Rich Templeton', 'Visible, yep.', 'Ross Seymore', \"My car has more content than today's car. On the industrial side, I think if you conceptually hit it, but it doesn't seem quite as [that’s] immediately to think about, but if you think about that trends like factory automation, more electronics, that whole content is dynamic. You think that takes the market that used to grow kind of mid-single digit-ish and accelerate that over the next 10 years that grows faster than the last 10 years. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"So, first I think the characterization that you give is very accurate, that it's not as easy to touch or feel. It's also not as easy to analyze. You know think of your world of – let me try to get into equipments and break it down, because you know you have State House Industrial, these starts in what we’ve got 13 sectors and you’re like oh crap! You know where we are going now?\", \"Well, and then inside of that its literally 100s if not 1000s of end equipments and so the ability to analyze that is hard. By the way, the ability to attack that takes very unique capabilities in terms of sales teams, TI.com and the systems to get to those, to that reach. But the beauty of it, also very difficult for your competitors to take if you've gotten there and so I think it has great dynamics. \", \"In terms of the growth potential, let’s stay with the, is it 5% historically, I don't know the exact number. I think it's got the ability to at least maintain that level, meaning we could have a pretty modest GDP and content growth just puts a multiplier on top of that. So do you have a 5% or 6% or 7% you know industrial growth environment, I think that's quite likely. Even potentially maybe with a questionable global economy and I don't mean just 2020 or in the near term, but you know depending on your view longer term and then by the way can we do a little better than that. \", \"And so those to me are encouraging opportunity and the good news is we don't have to establish credibility that we can do it. We're carrying a pretty good 5-year, 7-year track record in both industrial and in automotive that the things we’re doing are working and we're continuing to invest even more aggressively in those extended further. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Last end market question for you. You mentioned about kind of holding serve on the com infrastructure and the personal electronic side of things. In com infrastructure people often times ask me if TI is taking its focus off that business and is losing share for some reason or another. How are you guys attacking that market now and between the embedded and the analog side, what might be different in your approach today versus say 3G, 4G transition. ', 'Rich Templeton', \"Yeah, so you know we've been very clear and I think we said at the starting, I forget, five or six ago, where we said look, when you look at the macro trend, secular CapEx expenditures by operators is not going to keep going up. Just go look at their budgets and their capital expenditures and so it's just to me the classic disciplined mistake of well, the market's going to stop growing, let me double down and try to make up for it with market share, which is usually when people do very bad things. \", \"But what we said is very clear and that is we're going to bring down the investment on the embedded side, because that baseband portion of the business is not going to grow. But we're going to take up the analog investment, because what they will do is try to get more capacity, more spectral efficiency across the spectrum they have and so we love what's going on with 5G. It’s growing and our analog participation in it is wonderful. You actually see that in the numbers, okay. \", \"When you try to understand a little bit of why is embedded weaker and analog growing stronger, that’s not all, but it's certainly one factor and so I think we're going to continue to do very well on the analog portion of that com infrastructure business, and so I think it’s going to be an important business for a long time for us. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Then the last topic I want to hit on in the time we have is, it gets us all the way down to the free cash flow side of things is kind of the key tenant and the TI story.', 'A - Rich Templeton', 'The easiest thing to understand.', 'Q - Ross Seymore', 'You guys have done – if I think about the metric that gets you down to free cash flow, obviously the revenue side, margin, FX, those sorts of things, you kind of hit on all of them except for the margin side. Operating expenses you guys run as tight as anyone, that if 20 years ago somebody told me that TI could run with 10% of sales an R&D guy would have said ‘No Way,’ but you guys have proven that is very sustainable. ', \"If I'm thinking the next five or 10 years going forward, what do you think the biggest driver of gross margin contributor to free cash flow and not just we know revenues, we know fall through rates, but any other sort of levers that you think your unique to TI and is driving that metric north. \", 'Rich Templeton', \"Yes, so I won't surprise you with you know the answer. I still think if you’re trying to put round numbers on it, 70% to 75% fall through on the way in or on the way out is a good number to use. \", \"Yes, we understand that the past five years have probably been over on the fall through on the way in, but I think you see the advantages of that 300 millimeter product mix in the number of things you’ve touched on and you know it very well. And then on either the absolute gross margin or the absolute free cash flow margin, you've heard us say it and I’ll repeat it here. We do not spend time riveted on that. I care far more about free cash flow per share of growth rate over the long term. \", \"Now, if margin can increase at the same time that revenue is growing, we're not going to stop the gross margin or the free cash flow margin going up, but we spent no time trying to maximize those. What owners really want is – and you give us great free cash flow per share of growth over five years and 10 years; that's what generates rewards for the owners. \", \"So that's very much where that focus is. We've made good progress on the margins and the absolute free cash flow per share growth rate and you know we’ll stay focused on that going forward. \", 'Ross Seymore', 'Great! With that… [Cross Talk]', 'A - Rich Templeton', 'Hopefully I haven’t surprised you with the response on that.', 'Q - Ross Seymore', 'No bonanza surprises at all.', 'A - Rich Templeton', 'You’re shameful!

Steve, go ahead.\", 'Steve Schlecht', \"Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 conference call. We have a fair amount to cover on today's call, but before we begin, I want to acknowledge the contributions that Stephanie Pugliese has made to our company. As CEO, she worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to execute our strategy to build an omni-channel approach to marketing, she led the growth of our successful women's category, and oversaw the addition of 50 retail stores. \", 'Her talents and achievements did not go unnoticed and opened the door to a new opportunity with Under Armour. Everyone who has worked with Stephanie will miss her and we wish her the best success in her new endeavor. Following her unanticipated resignation, it was an easy decision for me to step back into the role of CEO.', \"As Duluth's Founder, I'm very proud of what we've accomplished and I'm totally committed to ensuring the continuity of our vision, our culture, and our forward momentum. While I haven't been the public face of Duluth Trading for some time, I have been actively involved in all aspects of the business.\", 'With our talented and dedicated team, we have achieved a smooth transition without any disruption to our business and we remain totally focused on our all-important fourth quarter. That said, we have our work cut out for us. Our performance in the first half of the year was below our expectations, and it will definitely pressure the outcome for the full fiscal year.', 'In response, we have taken down our guidance for 2019. Dave will address the details of our second quarter financial results, this revised guidance and the plans we have moving into 2020. Also, I want to recognize that we have had some growing pains over the last year-and-a-half. I want to see a slowdown in the pace of our retail expansion in 2020, and focus more on improving asset productivity and thus our operating margin rate.', 'We have made a number of behind-the-scene improvements in our business that will bear fruit in 2020, which excite me. We have a strong team in place to execute our plans and to ensure the long-term success of the business.', 'In general, our top priorities remain the same. First, is to drive top-line growth through new product offerings and targeted marketing that expands our brand awareness. Second, is to leverage our cost structure to drive profitability, while ensuring that we exceed customer expectations. And third, to achieve greater return on our investments.', 'Our team is well underway to implementing these top priorities, and we expect to see signs of improvement in the second half of this year.', 'And now, I will turn the call over to Dave.', 'Dave Loretta', 'Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported net sales of $122 million, up 10%, compared to $111 million last year. Our Direct segment sales were essentially flat to last year at $60.3 million and our Retail segment sales grew 24% to $61.7 million.', 'For the quarter, shipping revenues were $1.6 million compared to $1.9 million last year. The growth in Retail was primarily driven by new stores opened in 2018 and 2019. During the quarter, we added four new stores and over 60,000 gross square feet, with each of them being our first stores in the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Alabama, and Georgia. We ended the quarter with a total of 55 stores, compared to the prior year of 39 stores.', 'In the second quarter, we continued to experience the challenges we face in the beginning of the year. Sluggish sales trends in the direct channel and existing store markets deepened in the second quarter, especially in May, with traffic and overall sales volumes falling short of our expectations.', \"In an effort to drive more store and web traffic, we extended our global promotions and took deeper markdowns on spring and summer products, particularly on core men's items. As a result, our gross margin for the quarter declined 310 basis points for a gross profit of $64.8 million.\", \"Our women's business continues to outpace men's, with an overall growth rate of over 20% for the quarter and mid-teens growth rate online. We expect this positive trend will continue in the back half of the year with a greater assortment of new women's items, the launch of our Workday Warriors collection, and an increased number of plus-sized skews. To address the more challenging men's business, we also have new product launches and an increased number of new items that we expect will reverse the current trend.\", 'Looking out to the second half of the fiscal year, we expect to see gross margins improve, but will fall short of making up for the first half declines. Two areas of pressure are heavier clearance activity in August and early September, and the unavoidable impacts of China tariffs, which we estimate will negatively impact gross margin by 20 basis points for the full-year.', \"As of now, our total sourced product with exposure to China is less than 15%. And by 2020, we expect to transition all our apparel goods out of the country, but we'll have a small remaining amount of accessories with minimal margin impact.\", 'Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.7% to $61.1 million, compared to $52.3 million last year. This included an increase of $400,000 in advertising and marketing expenses, $1.3 million in selling expenses and $7.1 million in general and administrative expenses.', 'As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense increased 280 basis points to 50.1%, compared to 47.3% last year. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and marketing costs decreased 90 basis points to 13.4%, compared to 14.3% in the second quarter last year, primarily due to advertising leverage gained from a higher mix of retail sales.', 'Selling expenses as a percentage in net sales decreased 30 basis points to 14.4%, compared to 14.7% last year. The decrease is attributed to improved shipping and fulfillment costs, partially offset by an increase in store labor due to additional stores.', 'General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 400 basis points to 22.3%, compared to 18.3% last year, primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs from the growth in the number of retail stores, an increase in depreciation expense due to investments in technology and corporate facilities, and an increase in personnel cost due to added headcount to support the growth of the business.', \"Despite the incremental store cost and associated lease expenses, we have now mostly cycled past the larger fixed investments in the business from last year. In the second half of the year, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decrease by over 150 basis points, compared with last year, and we'll support the expected growth in earnings going forward.\", 'For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.4 million or $0.20 per diluted share last year. Our adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million, compared to $13.1 million last year.', \"Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $3.5 million, net working capital of $66 million and $45 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. As a side note, I'd like to clarify the presentation of debt on our balance sheet. In the notes of our filings, you'll see roughly $28 million, of long-term debt related to a third-party entity called TRI.\", 'In accordance with ASC Topic 810, which covers the accounting for variable interest entities, we are required to consolidate this entity as it relates to the development of our corporate offices here where we are a tenant. Duluth Holdings is not a guarantor, nor are we obligated to repay this loan. The loan covenants under our bank line of credit exclude this debt.', 'Moving on, inventories increased 12% to $114.8 million, compared to $102.4 million for the comparable period last year. The increase in inventories due to the additional stores, plus slightly higher levels of clearance goods.', 'As we mentioned on our last call, our inventory plans for the back half of the year will result in a higher third quarter ending balance. This reflects our goal of receiving goods several weeks earlier to mitigate issues we had last year with a dislocated inventory in our DCs and store channels. Our expectation is to have inventory back in line with expected sales growth by year-end.', 'Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $7 million, compared to $12.8 million last year, and were primarily for the new store openings. While we will complete 2019 with 15 new stores, we expect the pace of capital outlays will moderate going into 2020, as we rebalance our business model to focus on driving greater returns on the capital invested and driving positive free cash flow.', \"We plan to continue opening stores in new markets, but we'll likely plan for expanding square footage by 30% to 40% less than we have over the last few years. We expect the capital deployed for systems and infrastructure will also moderate, as much of the foundational investments needed to scale and support our growing omni-channel business are now in place.\", 'Two key initiatives that remain on our technology roadmap include an upgrade to our store POS systems and a re-platform of our customer data warehouse. Both are expected to be implemented next year, and will have tangible revenue driving benefits. We will provide further direction on our updated capital expenditure plans when we provide guidance for 2020.', 'As Steve mentioned, we are adjusting our outlook for the second half of the year based on the first half softness. We expect to deliver second half year-over-year sales growth of roughly 10%, supported by four main drivers. First, new market expansion with stores. We are on track to open 15 new stores in 2019 in 13 new markets.', \"Second, we anticipate growth rates in online sales in the mid low-single digit range, supported by continued strong online growth in our established markets. Third, newness. We'll see growth from new products in both men's and women's categories supported by tighter whole house marketing messages and advertising that drives traffic to stores and our website. And lastly, improved inventory flow and positioning to satisfy our customers' expectation for completing the sale wherever and whenever they want.\", \"In addition to growing top line, we've also been keenly focused on expense management, including getting the most out of our advertising spend. The steps we've taken to leverage fixed cost and gain variable expense efficiencies are already yielding results.\", \"Now that I've given you some color around the second half of the year, here's an updated guidance for the full fiscal year 2019. We expect to deliver sales growth of roughly 10% on a 52-week basis or net sales of between $610 million and $620 million in 2019. We expect gross margins to be down 50 basis points to 100 basis points, and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 48% to 49%.\", \"We expect 2019 earnings per diluted share to be between $0.60 and $0.66, which compares to $0.68 last year on a 52-week basis. This assumes a full-year weighted average diluted share count of 32.4 million shares and a tax rate of 26.5%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $51 million and $55 million and capital expenditures of roughly $40 million. But most importantly, we expect the second half of 2019 to be our turning point on growing operating margins and delivering the growth in bottom line results we've been planning for and investing in.\", \"With that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator?\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Jonathan Komp from Robert W. Baird.', 'Jonathan Komp', 'Yes, hi. Thank you. Steve, I just wanted to maybe start and just ask a broad question. Given that transitioned in place and your positioned back in the leadership role, can you just give an update on kind of what you see over time? Do you expect to initiate any type of search for a permanent replacement, or how long might you be committed to overseeing operations in the current role you are?', 'Steve Schlecht', \"Good morning, Jon. Well, as I told our Board, I'm all in this and very willing to spend the time that it takes to complete the search, but also to make sure that we have a very successful fourth quarter this year and we build the roadmap for 2020. I really see us starting the search in early 2020. And our focus will be on someone who really has strong brand credentials, merchandising, marketing, retail and direct marketing. Those will be a lot of things we'll be looking for. So, hopefully, we'll have the search completed by mid-to-late 2020, Jon.\", 'Jonathan Komp', \"Okay, great. That's helpful. And maybe a question about the comments into 2020 and the decision that this moderate the retail growth, maybe just bigger picture conceptually, how you're thinking about that moderation. Is that more of a pause temporarily till the business gets back on more of a solid footing from an operating margin and earnings perspective? Do you think that's a longer-term shift? And maybe if you could just talk about some of the benefits you expect to accrue from just being able to focus more on the core business and maybe less on the rapid retail expansion?\", 'Steve Schlecht', \"Well, yes, it is somewhat of a pause. But we're still committed to a national footprint with our stores in the future. My objective here is to see us improve our operating ratio. And to do that, part of it is to slow down the growth of the business. We've digested a lot over the last two years, took on a lot of changes and whatnot, and I think it's time that we really focus on executing well and continue to build the brand. Dave, do you have anything else that you might add to his question at this point?\", 'Dave Loretta', \"Yes, Jon. We don't have the longer-range plans detailed out yet. Moderating capital growth into next year is a combination of focusing on what we've already invested, but also some cautiousness on where the economy, where the industry might be going and just not getting too far ahead of ourselves in terms of deploying more capital. But it doesn't mean that we don't think the brand still has the same long-term growth opportunity that we've always articulated. So, nothing is really set in stone on that longer-range growth. We're still targeting the range of – our long-range objectives as we always have.\", 'Jonathan Komp', 'Okay. And maybe just one follow up, Dave. Following up on that and asking a little bit different, but when you look at the SG&A ratio this year, 48% to 49% would be a high mark for the company. Is there any sort of longer-term vision on where that could be and maybe just any broad stroke comments on the individual pieces where you could get some leverage over time, especially with less of a focus on the capital investment growth in the short term?', 'Dave Loretta', \"Jon, I guess, specifically on the SG&A rate, I mean, we know we've got the opportunity to leverage that and that's going to start to be realized this second half of the 2019. Getting our operating margins back to where they historically were in, high-single digit, low-double digit is still our objective. So, we think that's not coming at the expense of more capital. It's – they go hand-in-hand.\", 'Jonathan Komp', 'Okay. Appreciate the perspective. Thank you.', 'Dave Loretta', 'Thanks.', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Dylan Carden with William Blair.', 'Dylan Carden', 'Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. I was wondering either Dave or Steve, if you could talk about some of the behind-the-scenes investments that you alluded to in your prepared remarks and just sort of how those flow throughout sort of the balance of the year and into 2020, and when benefits from those at least from an operating margin standpoint are expected to really take hold?', 'Steve Schlecht', \"Yes, Dylan, I guess what we've talked about from the investments in our infrastructure and logistics, I mean, those have been in place starting last year and the benefits that we're getting from those are materializing in our ability to leverage SG&A. So, I think that's been clear as to how we've articulated where some of the capital spend has been. If there's a specific area within that, that you were curious about, I'm happy to go deeper with you.\", 'Dylan Carden', \"Yes, I guess maybe then sort of store functionality. I know POS rolling out next year, but some of the inventory management tools that you've implemented, any kind of early signs as to how those are helping sort of drive efficiencies?\", 'Steve Schlecht', \"Sure. Well, we definitely have the opportunity within the inventory planning and flow of goods to improve that, where we're going to see in this back half of the year is a better inventory positioning from the planning standpoint and from an open to buy. So, we expect that's going to be – that's already materializing in a better handling, better throughput of the inventory, better logistics coming down from having inventory in the right locations and having the goods in the right place and having them in the stores more timely. And that comes from both, use of the tools, but also our planning approaches to that. So, that's what's going to realize in the benefits.\", 'Dylan Carden', \"Great. And then, sort of I guess, following from that, any sort of guidance you can give around on the flow, or particular around men's new product into the back half? Is that mostly a holiday event?\", 'Steve Schlecht', \"The flow is starting right now. I mean, we now have a new pants category that we're really excited about that expands sizing. And then we have some goods coming in our Alaskan Hardgear category that's going to be new, that will come out in the next month. But we're – we are resetting our store sets right now. And so, you'll see those on the floor starting this week and then more coming out in October.\", 'Dylan Carden', \"Great. And then I just – last one for me, sorry. Thanks for taking all the questions. Women's now, as a percent of the business, is there any update to that, sort of where that's landed or will end the year?\", 'Steve Schlecht', \"It's still going to be trending a little bit under 30%, close to 27%, but it's got a lot of momentum, and that comes from both, the product set that we put together for it, but also the strong marketing behind it, some of the TV advertising and in – coordinated marketing behind women's campaign and upcoming our Workday Warriors collection is new for us. And so, there is potential to see that 27% where we sit today, start to creep higher because of that opportunity.\", 'Dylan Carden', 'Great. Thank you very much.', 'Steve Schlecht', 'Thanks Dylan.', 'Operator', 'And this concludes our question and answer session. And this also concludes today’s conference call.

Finally, Donna Dellomo, our CFO, will review our financial results and a few items related to our outlook in more detail. ', 'We feel great about our second quarter financial results. Net sales increased by almost 45% to $48.1 million. Total comparable sales, which include same showroom and internet sales, increased 40.7%, driven by strong showroom comp increase of 31.8% and significant growth in our internet business of 71.5%.', 'In Q2, we again saw our comp growth driven by both transactions as well as ticket growth as our digital marketing strategies and multi-channel model allow us to draw new customers to the brands, while also driving repeat purchase behavior. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3.3 million for the second quarter.', 'Operationally, we made good progress against our strategic priorities in the second quarter. A few highlights are: One, we continue to lean into marketing, including a successful Memorial Day campaign to increase brand awareness and drive sales, which is reflected in our almost 45% topline growth for the quarter; two, we made strategic investments in our infrastructure to improve the overall customer shopping experience and position us for continued success as we scale the business including expanded capacity and increased accuracy of customer delivery; three, we opened two new and remodeled three showrooms during the quarter as we continue to increase our showroom presence; four, we enjoyed strong results from our pop-up shop business with Costco and given our continued success during the quarter, we were given the opportunity to run an 18-day event on costco.com, which emulates the in-store pop up shop partnership online. We had very encouraging results from this initial online events and have plans for another two online roadshows with Costco for later this year.', 'In addition to our pop up shop business with Costco, we continue to foster new relationships with other retailers, and we are very excited to announce today our new partnership with Macy’s to pilot four permanent shop in shop test locations. Not only will it increase our brand awareness and drive customer acquisition, but it is also a testament to the existing strength and appeal of our small but rapidly growing brand and innovative product line. Jack will discuss our second quarter operational progress and expand on the details of this exciting new partnership in just a moment.', 'As it relates to our outlook, given our strong Q2 financial performance, our marketing, and other plans for the remainder of the year, we are reiterating today our fiscal 2020 annual revenue guidance of 40% to 45% sales growth. We are also reiterating our expectations for positive adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020.', 'We are very pleased to be in a position to reiterate our full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook, despite increased tariffs, which is a testament to the tremendous progress we have made with tariff mitigation actions, which I will now discuss.', 'To start, I could not be more proud of our teams for their efforts and dedication to mitigating the impact of these special tariffs and optimizing our supply chain. Our focus on optimizing our supply chain is threefold. Number one, swiftly relocating manufacturing out of China; two, negotiating aggressive vendor discounts; and three, assortment, promotional shifts, and surgical price adjustments that have shown zero negative impact on sales to date.', 'First, in terms of relocating manufacturing outside of China, we have already successfully moved the majority of our Sactionals manufacturing to Vietnam and also Malaysia for redundancy. Sactionals without covers currently represents approximately 57% of our overall sales based on costs. The remaining portion of our Sactional production will have moved entirely out of China by the end of Q2 next year. A long-term Chinese manufacturing partner of ours is currently in construction on a new purpose-built, highly automated Sactionals factory located in Vietnam to support our continued rapid growth along with co-located cut and sew facilities for both Sac and Sactionals covers. Based on our success thus far, we are confident that we will make progress this year toward resourcing the balance of our Sac and Sactionals covers at a similarly rapid pace and expect to have only a small percentage of our covers manufacturing in China by the end of Q2 next year.', 'These expeditious production moves will eliminate our exposure to special tariffs and also result in lower first costs for these goods, even versus their pre-tariff levels, which you will see starting to flow through our P&L with the turnover of the associated inventories throughout next year.', 'Second, regarding vendor discounts, the minority piece of our Sactionals manufacturing that remains in China today has been discounted by our manufacturer, to a cost that offsets most of the effect of the recently announced tariffs increase from 25% to 30%. Our cut-and-sewn covers for Sac and Sactionals and various accessories like throw pillows and blankets still manufactured in China are all subject to List 1 through 4 tariffs. And we have recently achieved aggressive vendor discounts on all of these items as well to carry us through the near term as we transition nearly everything out of China. We are particularly grateful to our vendors for their support in this area. They have been collaborative partners, and most of them are moving their operations with us out of China to various other countries in the region to retain our business, save on costs, and diversify our overall supply chain risk.', 'As a result of this work, we are pleased to share that as of this month, only 44% of our total goods are now manufactured in China, down from approximately 75% at the end of last year. And we expect this number to continue to fall by year-end by a few more points, heading toward zero before the end of next fiscal year if tariffs are not listed. It is because of all this swift execution and sourcing coupled with surgical assortment and pricing adjustments and disciplined expense management that we expect to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA, even with all of the recent tariff elevations and additions and our growth. Essentially, by the second half of next year, we project that the majority of our products will be coming in at lower costs than they were a year ago, and our supply chain will be far more robust and diverse.', 'This year, we expect gross margins to decline temporarily by 320 to 350 basis points for the full year versus last year. But, with our newly well-diversified supply chain and the lower corresponding ongoing product costs, we expect to return our run rate gross margins percent to the mid-50% range by the second half of next year.', 'Because of our exhibited pricing power, strong value proposition, collaborative manufacturing partners and relentless innovation machine, we are confident that we can maintain these best-in-class gross margins over the long term.', 'Finally, speaking of innovation, we are excited by the launch of the new Sactionals Power Hub this month. It is our first foray into electronics and it opens the door into numerous new technology innovation opportunities ahead for this brand. The concept is patented, and we believe it will not only drive repeat business, increased basket size and our average order value, but more importantly, because it’s reverse compatible with all the Sactionals pieces we’ve ever sold, it reinforces our unique commitment to our Designed for Life ethos in the eyes of our loyal customers.', 'Sactionals are a platform that is designed to grow and evolve and allow customers to add to it or upgrade it throughout their own lifetime, even in ways they could not have imagined when they originally bought the product. Every Sactionals piece that we have ever sold over these many years already has the receiver hole already embedded in it just waiting for this Power Hub, and maybe other inventions as well, yet to come.', 'We believe that over the long term, this will result in customer satisfaction and brand loyalty levels that will be unprecedented in the competitive landscape. Not to mention, the platform’s unique implications in terms of sustainability and reduced waste and landfills.', 'So, in summary, I’m very pleased with our financial and operational progress throughout the quarter. As we look to the second half of this year, we will continue to focus on executing against our strategic initiatives and leveraging our distinct competitive advantages to realize the significant growth potential that exists for Lovesac.', 'Before I turn the call over to Jack, I want to again thank all of our team members for the great job that they do day-in and day-out. Their hard work is driving a rapid growth, and we look forward to building on this performance as we move into the second half of the year.', 'From our standpoint, it’s simple. As I hope we’ve demonstrated across the four quarters we reported since becoming a public Company. We’re going to keep delivering high sales growth while maintaining positive adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis. External challenges notwithstanding, we are very confident in our ability to deliver on our near and long-term goals and look forward to updating you on our progress.', 'I will now turn the call over to Jack, our President and COO, to go over our key priorities for the remainder of this year.', 'Jack Krause', 'Thank you, Shawn, and good morning, everyone.', 'As Shawn said, we’re pleased with our second quarter results. We delivered strong financial performance and continued to execute against our key growth initiatives.', 'I’ll now review some of the operational highlights and discuss our plans for the remainder of the year.', 'Starting with expanding our marketing efforts to increase brand awareness and drive sales. Our second quarter top line results are a testament to the continued effectiveness of our marketing strategies. For the quarter, we achieved overall comparable sales growth of 40.7%, driven by web comps of 71.5% and showrooms at 31.8%.', 'Overall, Memorial Day marketing ROI finished very strong, as indicated by our sales performance. The Memorial Day pre-tentpole TV campaign test market saw a strong lift in weekly sales averages versus their pre-twelve-week sales average, increasing both sales and program ROIs. Given these encouraging results, we scaled the test to 11 markets for Labor Day, and subject to continued positive results, we will look to scale this nationally in the fourth quarter of this year.', 'In terms of digital media advertising, the six-week Pinterest test Campaign during Memorial Day proved to be an efficient driver of brand awareness and site traffic with over 360,000 clicks to the site at a very favorable CPC or cost per click. We also saw great engagement within the platform with almost 30-time increase in monthly viewers and an over 30x increase in monthly engagers.', 'Overall, we’ll continue to test increased digital marketing in the second half, as we continue to see increased ROIs as a result of the synergy with TV advertising.', 'We will look at new efficient marketing strategies to drive the business as we look towards the fourth quarter. Importantly, many of the in marketing initiatives we have successfully tested so far this year to drive sales will be leveraged the most heavily in the fourth quarter.', 'Next, expanding and improving our showroom presence. We opened two new showrooms and remodeled three in the quarter ending the quarter with a total of 80 showrooms and approximately 70 of our locations having been remodeled to the current rebranded showroom design. We remain on track to open 17 new showrooms in fiscal 2020 including showrooms in 12 new markets, and improving our penetration in 5 markets.', 'Turning to our pop up shops. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we operated 209 pop up shops with Costco, up from 137 in the second quarter last year, which drove a 40.9% increase in our other channel sales to $7.4 million. Pop up productivity increased 5.1% in the quarter. As discussed on previous calls, pop up shops have been a contributor to our growth over the past 24 months. Last year, our 10-day road shows with Costco delivered $1 per square foot productivity, multiples higher than even our own showrooms, driving over $19 million in net sales, which was over a 300% year-over-year growth.', 'In addition, we believe these pop up shops drive additional revenue on our website, both during and post show. We continue to believe that the pop up shop format allows us to capitalize on customer acquisition opportunities in high traffic locations by showcasing a limited offering of our products in the areas where we don’t necessarily have a showroom presence, introducing our brand and unique product attributes to a wider market.', 'Due to the success of our road shows, we worked with Costco to bring an 18-day event to costco.com, providing Lovesac with nationwide coverage. This event ran in July, and the results were very encouraging. The dotcom event generated nearly $750,000 in sales in 18 days. And due to the success, we’ve scheduled additional two events for the balance of the year.', 'We’ve also been exploring more permanent shop in shop opportunities to deploy a similar concept with other retailers and are very pleased to announce that we have officially entered into a partnership with Macy’s to pilot a test of shop in shop in four highly attractive Macy’s locations in Q3 of this year.', 'The locations include their Herald Square flagship store in New York City, as well Carle Place Furniture Gallery in Long Island, Del Amo fashion center in LA County, and Lenox Square in the Buckhead District of Atlanta. Macy’s is a logical choice for us as they have demonstrated the ability to be a leader in bringing innovation to the retail furniture space. We have had tremendous success with pop up shops outside of our own channels and look forward to establishing additional reach for the Lovesac brand with Macy’s as we expand the Lovesac shop in shop presence in an agile and efficient manner.', 'Unlike the Costco road shows, which are 10-day shows and pop up locations, the Macy’s test will be launching permanent asset light shop in shops in key Macy’s locations. We know that experiencing the Sactionals demo is extremely important to many customers’ shopping journeys, and through this partnership, we will be able to deliver more demos to a broader audience and accelerate adoption of the Sactionals platform. We believe the Macy’s brand and customer profile is a great fit with the Lovesac brand and look forward to kicking this pilot off in Q3, with the majority of the sales impact expected in Q4.', 'These shop in shops will be designed to be permanent locations carrying the same digital technology of our showrooms and will be staffed by Lovesac employees under the direct supervision of our sales operation team. Because these will be run like our own showrooms, we expect margin rates and contribution to be similar to our freestanding showrooms, but with significantly less CapEx investment, less than a third of our current CapEx per show room. The current plan is to test these four initial locations for at least the full year prior to expansion. And we will continue to update you on test details, performance and potential expansion plans as that information becomes available.', 'Finally, as part of our continued investment in our team in support of our substantial future growth, we’re very excited to announce the appointment of Tom Lee as our Chief Supply Chain Officer, effective September 9th. Tom is a seasoned supply chain and merchandising executive, and most recently served as SVP, Chief Supply Chain Officer SpartanNash. And prior to that, he spent years at Walmart and Office Depot in both senior supply chain and merchandising roles. We’re very excited to have him on board and look forward to benefiting from his expertise as we continue to develop a world-class supply chain that delivers an unparalleled customer experience. This important addition positions the business well for continued success.', 'So, in summary, we’re pleased with our second quarter results and the operational progress made on our strategic priorities, including all of the tariff mitigation work that Shawn went over. As we look to the remainder of the year, we’ll continue to focus on growing the business and strategically investing in our infrastructure and technology to position the business for long-term growth.', 'Donna will discuss our guidance in further detail. But, as we look ahead, we continue to be confident in the drivers of our business, of which, we will see the greatest impact in Q4, including the new business opportunities I just discussed with Costco and Macy’s, the marketing plans with the proven highest effectiveness, and year-over-year spend increases in Q4 as well as increased showroom opening along with the launch of the Power Hub that Sean discussed.', 'And with that, for a more detailed review of our second quarter results, as well as a few items related to our outlook, I will now turn the call over to Donna Dellomo, our Chief Financial Officer.', 'Donna Dellomo', 'Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone.', 'I will begin my remarks with the review of our second quarter results and then provide some commentary around our thoughts for fiscal 2020.', 'Total net sales increased 44.8% to $48.1 million from $33.2 million in the prior year quarter. This sales growth was driven by strong showroom, internet and pop up shop performance with both transaction as well as ticket growth resulting from successful advertising and marketing strategies, which drew new customers to the brand while also driving repeat purchase behavior. An increase in the number of showrooms also helped fuel our Q2 sales performance. Comparable sales, which include showroom and internet sales, increased 40.7%. Comparable showroom sales increased 31.8% and represent our 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp showroom sales increases. We opened two new showrooms and ended the quarter with 80 showrooms.', 'Looking at our results by channel for the second quarter. Showroom sales increased 35.8% to $31.3 million, internet sales increased 71.5% to $9.5 million, and our other channel, which includes our pop up shops in Costco locations, increased 57.7% to $7.4 million.', 'By product category, our Sactionals sales increased 51.5%, our Sac sales increased 35%, and our other category sales, which include decorative pillows, blankets and other accessories, decreased to $200,000 from $800,000 in the second quarter as compared to the prior year quarter.', 'Gross profit dollars increased 36.1% to $24.3 million in the second quarter. As expected, gross margin percentage decreased by 320 basis points to 50.4% from 53.6% reported in the same period last year. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by the 10% tariff impact, partially offset by reduced costs of our Sactionals and Sac products, primarily related to cost savings from a change in the sourcing of our Lovesoft and down blend fills and an ongoing shift of our manufacturing to Vietnam and other countries outside of China.', 'For the second quarter, total SG&A, excluding advertising and marketing expense, increased 7.3% to $22 million from $20.5 million in the second quarter of last year. Excluding approximately $300,000 of other nonrecurring expenses, total SG&A increased to $21.7 million. The increase in SG&A was driven largely by variable expenses related to the increase in sales, as well as higher employment costs and rent, which were partially offset by a decrease in overhead expenses and equity compensation, as detailed in our press release. As a percentage of sales, total SG&A expense decreased by 15.9%, driven largely by decreases in stock compensation and IPO-related expenses as described above.', 'Our investments in advertising and marketing which benefit extended periods, increased $2.5 million or 68.8% over Q2 prior year. As a percentage of sales, advertising and marketing expenses increased 180 basis points to 12.6% this quarter, largely due to an increase in advertising related to Memorial Day, which had a very positive ROI.', 'Depreciation and amortization increased $447,000 from the prior year period to $1.2 million, principally related to capital investments for new and remodeled showrooms.', 'In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, operating loss was $4.9 million compared to an operating loss of $7 million in the second quarter of last year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, adjusted operating loss was $4.6 million, excluding approximately $300,000 of nonrecurring expenses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, adjusted operating loss was $5.7 million, excluding approximately $1.3 million of non-recurring expenses.', 'Net interest income was 169,000, which relates to the impact of our IPO and other primary share financing. Tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019 was less than $10,000 and is related to minimum state income tax liabilities.', 'Before we turn our attention to net income, net income per share and EBITDA, I would like to point out that my discussion of these metrics will focus on net income and net income per share adjusted for the IPO and other financing costs, as well as adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the terminology and reconciliation between each of our adjusted metrics and their most directly comparable GAAP measurements in our earnings release issued earlier today.', 'Adjusted net loss was $4.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, compared to an adjusted net loss of $5.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Net loss per share adjusted for the IPO and financing costs was $0.31 in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $0.63 in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3.3 million, as compared to a loss of $2 million in the second quarter of last year.', 'Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $44.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Ending inventory increased 101% year-over-year, driven by higher sales, as well as an increased investment in the weeks of supply of inventory on hand to support sales growth across all channels to be agile enough to support the success of our advertising and marketing investments, and includes an increase in capitalized freight and warehousing costs relative to the build of inventory and tariff charges.', 'Now, I would like to discuss a few items as it relates to our fiscal 2020 outlook. From a showroom perspective, for the full fiscal year 2020, we are on track to open 17 new showrooms this year with 11 showroom openings in the second half of fiscal 2020 and continue to expect to remodel 8. We are now referring to our Costco road shows as pop up shops and our Macy’s pilot as shop in shops, given the nature of the shop setup.', 'As mentioned for fiscal 2020, we will operate three Costco online road shows in addition to our in-store pop up shops with Costco, as well as four pilot shop in shop up with Macy’s.', 'We continue to expect to deliver strong levels of sales growth between 40% to 45% in full fiscal 2020. However, we do expect Q3 revenue to be below the low end of our annual growth target with growth of approximately 30%, whilst Q4 is expected to be significantly above the high end of this annual range. This expected cadence is due to the following items. We expect to see a deceleration in total comp sales in Q3 with Q3 comps expected to be slightly ahead of Q3 total sales growth with a significant increase in total comp sales in Q4. However, important to point out that Q3 total comps on a two-year basis are projected to be in line with Q2 of fiscal 2020. Normal seasonality of the business with Q4 being our largest volume quarter, the cadence of planned investments in marketing and advertising with investments in working media strategically being made late in Q3, which have greater ROIs and greater impact on Q4 sales growth.', 'In addition, total showroom revenue will be impacted by the timing and the number of new showroom openings during Q3 and Q4, which this fiscal is weighted more heavily in Q4 than Q3. The number of Costco pop up shops continued to increase over prior year with the most significant increase in the number of pop up shops happening in the first half of fiscal 2020 as compared to prior year. Second half 2020 Costco pop of shops are projected to be as revenue productive as those in the first half of fiscal 2020.', \"The new initiatives that Jack mentioned to include costco.com road shows and the four new Macy's pilot shop in shops will have the greatest amount of fiscal 2020 impact on Q4 revenues.\", \"Consistent with the just discussed expected sales growth cadence, we expect a larger Q3 adjusted EBITDA loss than we reported in Q2, followed by a substantial improvement in Q4. Given the significant tariff mitigation process we've made, as Shawn discussed, we continue to expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2020.\", 'We expect full-year gross margins for fiscal 2020 to be approximately 320 to 350 basis points lower than fiscal 2019, principally related to the following: Expected tariff pressure, which is being offset by mitigation actions and SG&A initiatives; investments into our distribution infrastructure to support future growth; a slight headwind due to the continued shift in product mix towards Sactionals, as well as a slight impacts from prior pop up shop channel mix sales. These decreases are partially offset by product margin gains relating to changes in discounting and promotional strategies, reduced product costs related to vendor sourcing strategy, and vendor rebates, as well as an accelerated shift of sourcing outside China.', 'In terms of SG&A, excluding advertising and marketing expense, as previously mentioned, we expect the most significant SG&A leverage to be generated in Q4, given the seasonality of our business. As a reminder, embedded in our SG&A outlook is all of the investments we are making in the business across people, process and infrastructure, and our Q4 net sales volumes enable us to produce the greatest amount of leverage on these investments over the prior year.', 'So, in summary, while we continue to expect quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of our tariff mitigation efforts, our advertising and marketing investments and investments across all areas of the business to support the significant growth opportunity we have, we anticipate that we will again deliver a high sales growth rate and will generate a positive adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2020.', \"Finally, as it relates to capital expenditures, we now expect to incur approximately $11.5 million of CapEx in fiscal 2020 versus our prior guidance of approximately $13 million, due to a timing shift of investments of the Sac manufacturing CapEx to fiscal 2021. The vast majority of our CapEx will be spent on the opening of 17 showrooms, the remodel of approximately 8 legacy stores, the opening of 4 Macy's shop in shop pilot locations, and approximately $1.3 million being vested into the Sac manufacturing facility this fiscal. The remaining spend is being allocated to technology in our showrooms, inventory management and logistics systems, e-commerce platform enhancements, and for headquarters data and support systems.\", 'For all other details related to our results, please refer to our earnings press release.', 'With that, we would like to turn the call back to the operator who can open it up for questions. Operator?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave King with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed.', 'Dave King', \"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess, maybe first off, what's driving the confidence in the Q4 growth versus the Q3 guidance you laid out? It sounds like some of that's Macy's, but what are you anticipating from a two-year comp perspective versus what you had in Q2 and what you’re expecting for Q3, and what's driving that?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. Consistently -- hey, Dave, it’s Jack. We believe, roughly speaking, the two-year comps will maintain pretty consistent throughout the year. Obviously, we're going against tougher and tougher comparables. And the reason we feel confident in that is it's harder to see in terms of total marketing spend on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But, the working market -- the effect of our working marketing, which starts in Q3 and goes into Q4 will be by far the greatest impact in Q4 with roughly year-over-year working media spends plus -- over plus 60%, whereas if you look at the effect of the Q3 media, it was roughly flat to a year ago, so that'll give us a dramatic increase in comparable sales acceleration.\", 'Dave King', 'Okay. That helps.', 'Jack Krause', \"And to give just a background on that, the reason that we're doing that delay is, as we’ve talked about earlier, we've had several tests going on. And as we do our analysis, the opportunities to implement have come really in Q4 versus Q3.\", 'Dave King', \"Okay. And so, I know it's a little bit early on that front, but can you talk about the initial performance of the expanded regional media runs you had prior to Labor Day? Are the ROIs increasing, any early learnings so far?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. The pretty pre-tentpole events, so the expansion of the events is showing increases in ROI and run rate. So, at this point, we believe it will be part of the Q4 program. What I'll do -- I'll need to do is, we still haven't done sort of the final analysis of our Labor Day media. So, we'll be finalizing that in the next couple of weeks and then putting it into Q4 finalized program.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.', 'Brian Nagel', 'Nice quarter. The first question I want to ask, and I apologize, Donna, when you were laying out the guidance for sales, Q3 and Q4, I maybe just missed it. Could you remind or reiterate what the sales guidance for the third and fourth quarter is and the components of that?', 'Donna Dellomo', \"Yes. What we're saying is that year-over-year total sales will -- we're expecting to increase about 30% with a significant increase in fourth quarter. So, we're still lining into the annual guidance of 40% to 45%. So, we didn't give guidance for Q4. But, it will be significantly higher than the high range of the 40% to 45% annual guidance that we've provided.\", 'Brian Nagel', \"Got it. We can back into that just given basically a missing piece. And the primary reason for that -- and again, I'm sorry, because I know, I think, you have reiterated. I just want to make sure I get this right. The primary reason for that, so to say, choppiness is one, more difficult comparison; and then, two, just the cadence of the marketing investment?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. There are two things. So, you're right. So, I'll confirm that comment. And it's really broken into two things. So, you have on a comp basis, I just explained that that we’re dramatically increasing our marketing, relatively speaking our working marketing in the fourth quarter relative to the third, and we believe we'll get significantly higher lift. The other component of that is just initiatives. So, for example, in fourth quarter, we’ll have a dramatic increase in new showroom openings versus the third. The third quarter was really our lowest rate of new showroom openings we had in the last several quarters. And in the fourth quarter, we’ll also get the results of the Macy's shop in shop rollout as well as the two additional Costco shows we mentioned. So, those will have an incremental effect. So, we have some comp effects as well as just new business initiatives kicking in, in the fourth quarter.\", 'Brian Nagel', \"Got it. Then, the other question I had, just with regard to gross margins. Now, clearly, you've been – as you articulated in the press release and in your prepared comments, there’ve been a lot of efforts done to deal with so to say, the tariffs, so congrats on that. As we look at the gross margin degradation here in the second quarter, is there a way to parse that out of how much of that -- we're down 330 basis points year-on-year, how much of that is investment or one time in nature, as you deal with these tariffs versus a newer run rate type number?\", 'Donna Dellomo', \"Yes. The guidance that we had given, and it's still pretty consistent, that about 75% of that decrease in margin year-over-year is related to the tariff pressure. The other 25% relates to initiatives we have with opening up multiple warehouses, investing into some infrastructure, some cost increases on FedEx, some cost increases relative to the increase in inventory levels. But, the majority -- or at a minimum of 75% relates to the impact to tariffs.\", 'Brian Nagel', \"And then, my final question, with regard to Macy's, recognizing it's very, very early, how should we think about -- it sounds to me like the Macy's initiative will be closer to or more analogous, so to say, to one of your own showrooms. How should we think about the economics of a Macy's location in a showroom? And then, the second question on that is -- now this is, so Costco, Macy's, are you in discussions whether should we expect other type of retail partnerships in the not too distant future?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. Good question. So, I think, you're right. I think, Macy's is more analogous to our own showrooms, really with it being an asset light execution. So, we expect the CapEx spend on the Macy’s to be less than a third of a normal showroom. And we expect those to -- obviously, it's pretty easy to assume our hurdle rate would be the same types of returns we want to get as we would in showrooms. So, if you look at the CapEx that way, you could easily say that roughly between a 30% to 50% of -- the run rate of a Macy’s shop in shop will be roughly 30% to 50% of a normal showroom. Obviously, there are huge exceptions. For example, Herald Square is a substantial opportunity. So, that we'd look at that separately. But, it's very early. So obviously -- I think, the best way to look at it is look at the math and the CapEx investment and the way we're running them and model and what you think makes sense, because that's going to be as close as it is right now, because what we're really doing is testing it out.\", 'Brian Nagel', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.', 'Thomas Forte', \"Great. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple follow-ups on Macy's. So, the first question I had is, and I know Jack touched on this a little. But, why Macy's? Do you feel like they have a similar core customer base, just in general? And then, how should we think about the economics of the Macy's versus Costco? And then, refining that last question. So, if this pilot results in more shop in shops in Macy's, would you then limit adjacent showroom locations near those shop in shops?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Good questions. So, one is, why Macy's? I think, we're really looking at it -- I think, the one thing to do is think of this as a collaboration with Macy's and their top stores. So, if you look at the top 100 Macy's to the top 50 Macy's, we see a lot of shared attributes with our customers. Macy's is also a significant retailer in the furniture segment with hundreds of millions of dollars sold there. So, we think it’s a huge opportunity for furniture shoppers with like characteristics to be able to experience our product. And especially in those top Macy's, they're really doing a lot of interesting things. And I think that -- I think it will be a great partnership.\", 'In terms of the way it works is they are working much more like a showroom in terms of the way we will staff them with our own employees, we manage them through our own system. And we are essentially paying a rent rate to be inside of them that we expect the contribution of these to be significantly higher than what we’ve seen in the Costco pop up shops because of the way those are run.', 'Thomas Forte', 'And then, adjacencies for other showrooms, would you not fill the showrooms within a close proximity to Macy’s shop in shop?', 'Jack Krause', \"Yes, a little bit of insight into that. So, the way we're running the Macy's test, the reason we ran those four is for some interesting test parameters. So, for example, Herald Square is very close to our Flatiron District showroom. So, we'll look at what happens between showrooms that are left with a mile apart. We'll also have a test which has a showroom in the same mall as the Macy's, and we'll have that opportunity to see what happens. And then, we have a showroom in the Carle Place, Macy's, as this is one of their furniture locations. And we'll see what happens there. So, really at this point that -- the primary purpose of this test is to understand the dynamics and then to start laying out a plan in terms of how we maximize our penetration at the most efficient way and also do it in a win-win way with our Macy's partners.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed.', 'Alex Fuhrman', \"Great. Thanks very much for taking my question, and congratulations on another very strong quarter. A couple of things that I wanted to touch on here. One is, it certainly sounds like you guys have made a lot of progress in moving your production out of China and have a good line of sight to being completely out of there. It sounds like you're -- relative to the prior conference call, it sounds like that that has moved a lot faster and better than expected. Can you give us a sense of what's driving that? I mean, it sounds like your vendors have been incredibly supportive. Has there just been more buy in and capital commitment on the part of your vendors than you expected? Just kind of curious why you've been able to accelerate that so nicely.\", 'Shawn Nelson', \"Yes, great question. We have been moving very rapidly and we intend to continue moving rapidly. I don't believe that we ever intended to go slow. I just don't think we gave specific guidance on how fast we thought we could do it. I think, everything's moving according to our plan and it's exactly that. Our current suppliers have been very supportive, and in most cases, as I described are investing themselves in other countries outside of China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and even some others that are coming up. And meanwhile, for the goods that are left behind still, they're offering us heavy discounts in order to keep that business and kind of get through the tunnel, as it were with their lights on, so that they can support us on the other side, outside of China. And so, I think, it's just a confluence of things going well, things going according to plan, and our ability to execute, which obviously in the public markets, we're only a year out. And I think, it's a matter of those watching Lovesac, getting familiar with how we operate.\", 'Alex Fuhrman', \"And then, a couple of questions just on the Macy's partnership. Obviously, this sounds like a huge opportunity, big difference relative to Costco. I imagine, is that -- Macy's is a large furniture retailer on their own, and I'm curious, if you have a sense of or if it's been a big part of your negotiations with Macy's, where in the stores your shop in shops are going to be located? Are they going to be in the furniture sections or are you maybe going to do some that are near other furniture brands and some that aren't? Just curious how we should think about the placement of those shop in shops? And then, if it's going to be your own employees, is it fair to assume that you will be able to capture all of the customer data and own that customer relationship?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Great questions. Yes, our team -- I can tell you, it varies by -- the Macy's organization from the way they operate, obviously, because of the -- the stores are such a big volume and they have independent store management, the negotiations are store by store. We literally have to do walk-throughs with their teams in every store. What I can tell you is that they really believe in terms of the Macy's -- I'd say that the Macy's evolution, they believe this type of relationship is critical, and they're putting us in key places. And we’ve walked the stores with them and are very happy with the locations. And they're primarily very strong locations. Not necessarily obviously next to furniture, because in a lot of the locations we're testing, they're not even in furniture section. So, that's part of our learning agenda as to figure out what works most. And I would expect coming out of this, along with the answer to some of Tom's questions, would be some answers to your questions, in terms of what adjacencies are working most effectively, what parts of the model are working, are there attributes of a Macy's store over another store that allow us to accelerate the fastest? That's all that we're trying to do now, so that hopefully the next time we talk about this, we have some answers and we start laying out an execution plan. So, good questions, and we'll keep you posted on it.\", 'Alex Fuhrman', \"Great. Thanks very much for that. And then, lastly, your marketing has of course been very successful over the last couple of years and TV seems to have played a nice role in that. It looks like up until the last couple of months that it’s basically been different versions of the same TV commercial, and then you came out with a different creative, a few months ago. Can you talk a little bit about have you seen a lift from that new TV creative, or was there maybe something kind of a magic formula in the last commercial? Just kind of curious, now that you've got your second commercial out there in the market, what type of response you've seen from that?\", 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. Good question. I would say that we were very careful obviously because we had such a successful creative execution as we started with this new execution. We tested these quantitatively and the new and a quantitative research mode in terms of persuasion and brand, attributes, et cetera. The new commercial actually tested equal to or better than the old one across the board. We also can tell you that initial results on the new television are showing that it's driving traffic at levels that we expect it to drive at, historically. Now, other than that, I think, you start to get into a whole media mix discussion, which I can't get into because we still don't have the total results for the Labor Day media run, which is still being analyzed and actually still -- the post Labor Day work is still going on. So, we'll probably have a lot more information for you in the next quarter about that. But, we're feeling very good about the creative overall.\", 'Operator', 'Next, we have a follow-up question from Thomas Forte with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.', 'Thomas Forte', 'Great, thanks. So, an investor asked me to ask the following question. They are really impressed with your comments on your gross margin outlook for next year returning to the mid-50s. Can you once again discuss what are the inputs that will drive that strong gross margin performance next year?', 'Shawn Nelson', \"Yes. I mean, the pressure on the business has been largely tariffs, as Donna has spoken to. We have a few other outside pieces, be it freights or pressures in the supply chain, logistics, et cetera, that are small, and Donna can touch on that. But, the vast majority has been tariffs. So, as we mitigate those tariffs, primarily through exiting China, not only are we then tariffs free as it were, at least special tariff free, but we also, as I mentioned, are getting lower first costs in these outside countries. And so, we were operating in the mid-50s range on gross margins and we expect to get right back to that as that product flows through our supply chain. So, it’ll be the second half of next year before on a run rate basis we begin to see that return to those levels. And because it's a run rate basis, it may take even longer to flow to the P&L as it were. But we feel very good about our ability to get back there and our ability to maintain that on the go forward. And I don't know, Donna, if you have anything else to add?\", 'Donna Dellomo', \"Yes. I mean, really, the major component is the tariff, some investments into infrastructure, which we will still continue to see through next year. And then, I think we'll start to see less of an impact on the shift to the pop up shops and Sactionals. I think, we're seeing the greatest amount of that shift happening now. So, when that all starts to level itself out, as Shawn has mentioned, we'll start to see on a run rate, right, start to see those margins elevate. We don't expect the full year to come in at that, but we'll start to see the quarters in the second half start to elevate to the higher mid-50% range.\", 'Thomas Forte', 'Great. Thank you, Shawn. Thank you, Donna.', 'Jack Krause', \"Yes. And just to add a note and beyond that, I think, it's important to state that, we've just hired Tom Lee as our Chief Supply Chain Officer. And I think, in the next 18 months to 24 months, we'll really be working on combining that supply chain and the logistics aspects into a value chain that allows us to start leveraging other areas. So, I think, we've only just begun to really get efficient as a company. And we'll be catching up with that growth in the next 18 to 24 months, outside of the whole tariffs issue.\", 'Operator', 'We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.', 'Shawn Nelson', 'Thanks very much for your support as investors.

I'm joined here today with Lakeland's Chief Operating Officer, Charles Roberson; and for the first time, our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, Allen Dillard. Welcome to the team, Allen.\", \"For those of you who did not see our press release over the summer, Allen was named our CFO effective August 12. So he's only had less than a month to close out our quarter and prepare for the earnings conference call. Allen comes to us with substantial experience spanning 3 decades in growing cross-border enterprises with public and private companies, including 10 years as an accountant with Ernst & Young. We believe he'll make a valuable contribution to our efforts in pursuing both domestic and international market expansion as well as driving meaningful improvements in profitability and cash flow growth.\", \"Today's call, we are going to discuss the status of the operations and our financial results. Then the call will be opened up so that we may respond to your questions. Now on to my formal remarks.\", 'We delivered solid financial and operating performance progress in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Quarterly revenues reached the highest levels of company history due in large part to filling in backlog orders when not including sales relating to emergency demand, which goes back to the Ebola and bird flu orders in our fiscal 2016 year. Although there is an ongoing threat of a potentially devastating Ebola outbreak again taking place in Africa, our sales growth in fiscal 2019 do not include anything to-date that we can ascertain as being connected with this emergent situation.', 'In our Q2, sales increased across a wide array of products, including disposable garments, chemical suits, fire retardant products and high visibility apparel. These products can be made from several of our manufacturing locations around the world with diversified supply chains to support our low-cost production practices. On a geographic basis, there was growth in the Americas, while Europe and China were negatively impacted by currencies as reported in U.S. dollars. The strong U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies reduced consolidated revenues by approximately 3%.', 'Our sales growth in Q2 was, to an extent, aided by our misfortune in prior periods as we were unable to process orders due to ERP challenges. Approximately $500,000 in revenues were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for orders that had been ERP delayed. Excluding this approximate amount, Q2 revenues would have been $27 million or an increase of 5.5% over the prior year. ', 'Eliminating the impact of FX, you can see that demand for Lakeland products globally increased substantially, nearly 4x that of U.S. GDP growth of 2.1% in the second quarter. But we are targeting mature markets like the U.S. and Europe as well as higher-growth markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America and other parts of the world. For example, in Latin America, which was our third largest market in terms of Q2 revenues behind the U.S. and Asia, we had a 32% growth in sales over the prior year.', 'Overall, new bookings in the second quarter of $16.3 million increased 25% from the prior year period and by nearly 7% from the first quarter. The big increase in U.S. sales came in direct containers which are not affected by the ERP system. Backlog at July 31, 2019, was $5.9 million, which increased from $5.4 million at the end of the first quarter due to increased bookings during the second quarter. ', 'This order flow is part of the reason for our increased inventory levels at the end of Q2. Absent any major shift in global economic activity or trade wars that has a psychological impact on our customers, we are experiencing a more normalized operating environment due to the confluence of 2 strategic imperatives which are gaining meaningful traction. The first of these relates to the ERP implementation which impacts our North American business that represents roughly half of our revenues. ', 'Products sold into this region are generally made in our manufacturing locations by volume in China, Vietnam, Mexico, India, the U.S. and Argentina. The ERP system is finally getting on track, and we are beginning to derive benefits in key performance indicators, such as order processing and delivering, raw material management and effective pricing and costing strategies. Delivery schedules have been met, and orders are being filled such that we are getting positive feedback from our customers.', 'In the second, in the fiscal second quarter, we experienced improvement in cost of goods sold due to our ability to track materials and expedite orders. We are in the process of unwinding finished goods such that we may have improved working capital, which in turn may enable incremental growth on the sales front. We previously announced an update of our ERP system that took place in late July to bring on additional improvements and features that centered on inventory metering. ', 'To do this, we shut down our U.S. information system at the close of business on July 27 through August 4, which resulted in 5 lost days of domestic sales on a reported basis, with 3 of the days falling into our fiscal second quarter. So again, our sales growth in Q2 was even more impressive. In late July shutdowns to work on the ERP system, net inventory adjustments were not as significant as in previous quarters even though we had an inventory increase of $2 million from Q1 to Q2. This is largely attributable to unanticipated efficiency improvements from the stage planning work benches, which have effectively shortened lead times by 3 weeks, increasing our inventory by roughly $2.7 million. We have since adjusted our lead times to correct safety stock levels and canceled manufacturing orders for products that exceeded target stock levels. This work continues as we intend to reduce safety stock levels by an additional 10%, bringing the total reduction to nearly $44 million.', 'The ERP system may shorten our overall product manufacturing cycle by about 2 weeks. This will eventually equate to a reduction in certain stock levels in the United States. The next step function for us is to begin realizing improved efficiencies that will result in decreased inventory levels, increased free cash flow as inventories are run down and reduced customer lead times. If we can do these, we have an excellent opportunity to not only grow our business domestically but take meaningful market share as we already has -- as we already have the lowest cost structure because we are the only major provider that owns and controls its manufacturing on a global scale. So the next operational aspect of interest to our customers is capacity and delivery timetables.', \"To this end, the second important operational objective was the expansion of our manufacturing facility in Vietnam. While many manufacturers around the world are contemplating a partial or complete exit from China in light of the ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. government, Lakeland's highly experienced management team further expanded the company's global manufacturing to include Vietnam. This was not done as a response to tariff wars but instead was a matter of vigilantly managing our cost structure. China is far more expensive for manufacturing today as compared to 23-plus years ago when we first arrived there and as compared to Vietnam or India today. We have a solid base of sales domestically in China, along with both manufacturing and regional Southeast Asian sales which will be maintained and grown as appropriate. Our China operation currently has a manufacturing team of nearly 540, down from as high as 800 just a few years ago.\", 'Two years into executing our planned expansion into Vietnam, we now have a manufacturing team of over 750 in this location and still can expand that by another 14%. Our manufacturing expansion into Vietnam is now essentially complete, including capital equipment purchases, investment in property and plant, hiring of staff and related organizational expense additions. While efficiencies are improving, we are not expecting to be fully maximized until the second half of fiscal 2021 on the cost side. This gives us ample runway for continued growth in our largest operating market, the U.S., where import tariffs are not applicable, as well as other international markets.', 'We are now enjoying a considerable increase in interest in our non-China manufacturing capability. As a result of the development of our Vietnam and, to a lesser extent, Indian manufacturing and the ongoing trade war and tariff adjustments, more and more of our customers are seeking a permanent alternative to Chinese-manufactured goods. This bodes well for our ability to push Vietnam and India into full capacity, which in turn will maximize the speed with which they can attain optimum operating efficiency.', 'Speaking of operating efficiency, we also performed well here in the second quarter. Operating income increased by 60%, while our operating margin as a percentage of sales grew as compared to the prior year period. ', 'We believe greater operating leverage can be achieved as we grow our global revenue base and effectively utilize our ERP system and our manufacturing in Vietnam reaches its productivity potential then India.', \"That concludes my remarks. I will now pass the call over to CFO, Allen Dillard, to provide a more thorough review of the company's financial results.\", 'Allen Dillard', \"Thank you, Chris. The following address is my review of the fiscal 2020 second quarter ended July 31, 2019. As Chris mentioned, I've been with the company for about a month, so my comments will be limited.\", 'Net sales were $27.5 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, as compared to $25.6 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and $24.7 million for the 3 months ended April 30, 2019. On a consolidated basis for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, domestic sales were $14.4 million or 53% of total revenues, and international sales were $13 million or 47% of total revenues.', 'The company experienced sales growth domestically, benefiting from easing of earlier delivery challenges associated with the ERP implementation as well as in all operating regions in the Americas excluding Mexico. Sales in Mexico were lower due to a large, recurring customer bid for fire resistant garments that was previously won and filled but has not been republished yet this year. Foreign exchange currency translations negatively impacted sales in the UK, Europe and China as reported on a consolidated basis in U.S. dollars.', \"China sales are included in our Asia Pacific business and led to a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis in U.S. dollars. We do not anticipate a recovery unless the U.S.-China trade dispute is settled. And even then, it will require time for China's manufacturing GDP to recover. In the meantime, we have shifted our focus to Southeast Asia in efforts to replace lost sales revenue. India and Russia were also slightly weaker in the second quarter. But because of the relatively small size of their sales, this can recover relatively quickly.\", 'Gross profit of $10.4 million for fiscal 2020 second quarter increased from $9.2 million for the same period in the prior year and from $7.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 37.9% for fiscal 2020 second quarter, up from 35.7% a year ago and significantly higher than 30.6% recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. ', 'Gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of sales benefited from higher volumes, which in part resulted from easing of ERP implementation issues, a more favorable mix of higher-margin product sales and improved contributions from the balancing of manufacturing between higher cost per unit and more efficient processing in China to lower cost, but less efficient processing in Vietnam, including substantial start-up expenses.', 'Through the end of our fiscal second quarter, we do not believe we experienced any meaningful impact to order flow or issues related to tariff increases. Our strong sales in the U.S. were driven primarily by large container orders, which may have been placed by customers who purchased, who were under purchased in Q1 and were attempting to replenish and return their stock to normal levels. We have not seen consistent preemptive ordering for any industry or market due to what we believe are circumstances that are very much in flux. What is certain for the time being is the additional 15% tariff that was applied to select garment lines effective September 1. And in anticipation, we sent customers a letter towards the end of Q2 about our price increases that will reflect the new tariffs. We have attempted to spur preparatory purchases and reduce inventory by offering discounts on purchases from our existing inventories between August 2 and August 31. ', \"To-date, it is difficult to determine the level of success of that program because of its short duration. We are hoping that our announced price increases, along with the Trump administration's additional 15% duty, will drive customers to make purchases. Our strategy in dealing with the trade war and tariffs include sales and marketing campaigns, price increases and movement of production or subassembly out of China primarily to our Vietnam location, which has been a success so far.\", 'Operating expenses increased 3.7% to $7.8 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, from $7.5 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and were up from $7.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 28.3% for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, compared to 29.3% for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and 31.9% for the 3 months ended April 30, 2019. As previously disclosed, we took a onetime charge of approximately $260,000 related to my predecessor as CFO, which is included in Q2 2020 OpEx. ', 'OpEx was further impacted by an increase in professional fees, offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. The performance improvement pertaining to the decrease of operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects higher revenues amid favorable business conditions and the processing of backlog orders with the easing of prior ERP implementation challenges. Lakeland reported operating profit of $2.6 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, up from an operating profit of $1.6 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and an operating loss of $0.3 million for the 3 months ended April 30, 2019. ', 'Operating margins were 9.6% for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, 6.5% for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and a negative 1.3% for the 3 months ended April 30, 2019. Income tax expense consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Income tax expense was $1.2 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, compared to $0.6 million for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018. Our estimated effective tax rate was increased primarily due to additional provisions in foreign jurisdictions and remeasurement and assessment of the GILTI tax impact. As a reminder, we evaluate the estimated tax provisions each quarter and adjust accordingly.', 'The company reported net income of $1.4 million or $0.17 per basic share for the 3 months ended July 31, 2019, compared to net income of $1 million or $0.13 per basic share for the 3 months ended July 31, 2018, and a net loss of $0.5 million or $0.06 per basic share for the 3 months ended April 30, 2019.', 'As of July 31, 2019, Lakeland had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $3.8 million from the beginning of the fiscal year. The decrease was primarily a result of the net increase in other working capital elements, most noticeable is inventory increasing by $7 million due to increased raw materials and finished goods necessary to scale up the Vietnam operation and to catch up on remaining orders delayed due to the ERP installation. Total debt outstanding at July 31, 2019, was less than $1.6 million, up slightly from $1.3 million on January 31, 2019. The company has in excess of $10 million of borrowing capacity under its various lines of credit.', 'Capital expenditures were approximately $0.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, down from $1 million in the second quarter of the prior year and up from $0.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. CapEx, or capital expenditures, for all of fiscal 2019 were $3.1 million and are expected to decline to approximately $2 million for fiscal 2020, with the majority of spending in the current year allocated towards the phased global rollout of the ERP system and additional manufacturing capacity in Vietnam and India.', \"We've been strategically deploying our cash to position the company for continued growth. Cash used in fiscal 2020 and 2019 included planned investments in [Technical Difficulty] in Vietnam and, to a lesser extent, India and the company's upgraded information technology system as well as our digital marketing evolution. Depending on product mix, we currently believe our run-rate of revenue from a normalized and efficient manufacturing standpoint could be in the range of $130 million to $150 million, up from our current Q2 annualized revenues of about $110 million.\", 'That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call back to Chris for his final remarks before we open the call to questions.', 'Chris Ryan', \"Thanks for the nice job, Allen. To conclude my formal comments, I'd like to address our stock buyback program. On our last earnings call in mid-June when our share price was about $12, we cited an outlook for improving cash levels as the reason for taking a closer look at our stock repurchase program. That was halfway through the second quarter, so we already knew to a meaningful extent what our cash would be at the half year mark given our anticipated capital allocation strategy. What's changed since that time is that we spent according to our plan, the second quarter was strong and our share price went even lower, perhaps reacting to the constant machinations by political leaders on cross-border trade issues.\", \"With this backup, we began to buy some shares towards the end of the second quarter. 9200 shares were purchased in the quarter as part of our $2.5 million stock buyback program approved on July 19, 2016. To-date, $1.2 million was spent to repurchase 114,848 shares with no shares purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and all of the other purchases made in fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the company's direction and progress including potential cash flow generation, which would be an even greater catalyst to encourage us to buy more shares. As we close out the first half of this fiscal year, we believe we are very well positioned with an impressive array of products for basic daily use and specialized applications, a diversified manufacturing presence around the world that provides us with flexibility to navigate an erratic macroeconomic environment, financial health and a growing global team to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\", 'That concludes my remarks. I will turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Operator?', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum.', 'Alex Fuhrman', \"Congratulations on a really nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the composition of the backlog. It sounds like you guys have made nice progress now implementing the ERP system and starting to get some results there. And it sounds like you had a nice amount of that backlog related to the ERP implementation that you were able to work through here in the quarter, but the backlog still looks pretty big, actually got a little bit bigger during the quarter. So just thinking about the orders still in that backlog. Are there still orders related to the ERP implementation? Or is this just more recent business that's come up in the quarter?\", 'Chris Ryan', 'You want to pick that up, Charlie?', 'Charles Roberson', 'Yes, Chris. Our backlog, currently, the $0.5 million that we took out in this quarter represents the bulk of the ERP backlog. Most of what we have now is incurred from sales in the current quarter.', 'Alex Fuhrman', \"Okay. That's really helpful. And then just thinking about gross margins and your product manufacturing, really strong looking gross margins here in the second quarter. Can you give us a sense of what the impact could be to your gross margins as you think about taking price increases to offset tariffs that could be coming? And then thinking about your manufacturing in China, obviously, you can diversify your supply chain for many years long before these tariffs. Can you give us a sense of how much of the product that you're currently manufacturing in China is then sold in China or elsewhere in Asia as opposed to being imported?\", 'Allen Dillard', \"I'm going to jump in here and try to answer that, and I'll kick it off to Charlie. Just jump in whenever you're ready, Charlie. As we look at margins, we really look at on, number one, where can we get the most manufacturing efficiency; and number two, based on that backlog of order flow. So kind of where we are margin-wise is we think we're seeing a more normalized margin environment, particularly as we begin to migrate our production to the lower-cost facilities. If you look at the numbers, you can tell that the bulk of the manufacturing that occurs in China comes to the U.S. and other markets. So as we migrate that to the lower cost, we believe that we're going to see some stabilization or normalization in our margins going forward. And I'll let Charlie kind of speak to how we're managing the production levels in those different facilities.\", 'Charles Roberson', \"Yes, to put a specific range on the margin right now is difficult because there are some headwinds to it. The entire trade situation is still very much in flux, and we're currently evaluating our Chinese product mix to see what we can and cannot move out of there. Not all of those products lend themselves to new operations. So we're reviewing our capacities globally trying to rationalize that in lieu of the new tariffs. But the bigger complication is knowing what the psychological impact of the trade war is going to be on our customer base. In the U.S., it represents 50% of our income. I think that there's an opportunity here for us or nearly, I'd say, to improve our margins. But in the current business environment and customer concerns over the trade war, we're looking for additive business outside of the U.S. to make sure that we have the capacity to keep everything running.\", 'Chris Ryan', \"What's important to note is that our Chinese operation can sell to every country in the world, or 49 countries currently, and cannot sell really to just one country, United States, unless they pay that 15% tariff. So when we look at the United States, we have our Indian operation, our Mexican operation and our Vietnamese operation able to export into the United States duty free. So we have a lot of flexibility here, and that's what I want to emphasize. It's only the United States that is putting a tariff on Chinese goods. The rest of the world is not.\", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Dave King of Roth Capital Partners.', 'Unidentified Analyst ', 'This is Scott stepping on for Dave. First, on the ERP system, do you have a dollar amount in cost of goods sold from the ERP impact in the quarter?', 'Chris Ryan', 'That would be Allen.', 'Allen Dillard', \"I don't know that we actually have the exact number. We know what the backlog was. We could go back and look at it. We could try and calculate that, but I don't have an estimate of what that might be currently at hand.\", 'Unidentified Analyst ', \"Okay. That's helpful. Now that ERP seems to be behind you, how are you feeling about your ability to meet demand? And did you happen to lose any customers during the ERP implementation?\", 'Chris Ryan', 'Charlie?', 'Charles Roberson', \"Dave, one of the things that we learned through our ERP implementation, you've got to remember that a bulk of the most complex part of it was our operations in Mexico, and we did have a number of customers that came to us and told us upfront that they were going to have to go elsewhere while we get through this. And we have seen, in the last quarter, a number of those customers return. I don't think we have all of them back yet. I think other people are still waiting to see more, but we don't anticipate significant customer loss at the end of this.\", 'Unidentified Analyst ', \"Okay. And lastly, how are some of your oil and gas customers holding up given some of the recent weakness there? Similarly, how's demand been in China given some of the matters of concern there? \", 'Charles Roberson', \"China is feeling that. Their GDP and industrial output has taken a hit, and we have seen some declines there. A lot of the diversification efforts that we've been through in the past year have been to lessen our reliance on the oil and gas sector. It's still significant. But our introduction of cleanroom products, work in electrical utilities are all meant to diversify ourselves away from the gyration, the fluctuations of that particular market. And I think we've been successful to a large degree.\", 'Chris Ryan', 'But oil and gas revenues have held steady with the exception of one customer in Mexico.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Thank you very much.', 'Operator', 'And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Ryan for any closing comments.', 'Chris Ryan', \"Okay.

What I’m going to try to do is to, over the next 10 minutes, set a context for everything you’re going to listen to over the next few hours and give you a sense of how I think about where they are and where we are going.', 'You’ve seen the idea of grow, diversify, build as our strategy now for some years, a decade more or less, and that hasn’t changed. The ideas to keep growing the core of our business, credit, debit, prepaid, those are consumer, and of course, our commercial business, which over time is picking up more sort of visions and more points of view to add to its capabilities.', 'But the idea is grow our core businesses because that’s what allows us to invest and reinvest in expanding the footprint of the company and to create new legs to our revenue stream.', 'Growing our core is fundamental to who we are. That growing our core, but doing it in a way that is prepared for everything that people want to do, which is seamless between digital and physical.', 'They don’t really care about whether you’re interacting with them through a physical device or a digital device. They want to be able to choose and interact in the way they want.', \"And so our whole vision has been for some time, as Ed McLaughlin, who now runs our O&T, said some years ago to me, he said, every device is a device of commerce. And so the idea is to allow people to interact with us through anything, through a card, through their sunglasses, through rubbing their forehead one day. And if that's what they want to do, if that's how they choose to interact with what they're going to do.\", 'And so our job is to not pick winners and losers in the manner in which they will interact. Our job is to be with them when they want to interact in a simple, safe, secure, convenient way.', \"So you will find a lot of effort in the company behind backing standards, global standards, in this case EMVCo standards, that support all the things that could make this idea a reality. That could be from security, 3DS 2.0 or tokenization that you know about or the very sort of interesting term we've given in the industry to SRC which is sort of internal base ball for a simple easy way to checkout online.\", \"And you’re going to see as this day goes through, you will find Michael and Jess will actually talk about all these aspects in some depth. So that's kind of the first thing I want to make sure you know we’re very focused on.\", \"Our commercial business started out some years ago principally as a card-driven business, and that’s still a large part of the volume and it's doing very well. And that business is corporate T&E, fleet cards, purchasing cards, the stuff that you will expect, small business cards.\", \"But there's a whole other opportunity in alternate payment flows, and that’s B2B account payables spaces that you know we’ve begun to talk about for a few years. And we’re trying to put our money where our mouth is with the right acquisitions to enable not just our play at the infrastructure level, but also enable a play at applications and services level, so we can try and be there in whichever way the opportunity presents itself in the marketplace. And that’s the idea of what our commercial aspirations are. Again, you will hear a great deal of that from Michael but also from Paul Stoddart as you go through the course of today.\", \"That's the grow pillar. That's what we're trying to do, grow the core, don't worry about physical and digital, it's the same thing. Think like that, think of technology as a business, not technology as a enabler to our business and then you starting getting this the right way. Design all products with APIs. Do it - you get the general idea of what I'm trying to say on growing the core.\", 'On diversify. Many years back, we were principally devoted to the large banks. We have moved very far from there. We are also devoted to them. After all they are the large banks and they control large segments of distribution, access, infrastructure.', \"But we have built out a good relationship with smaller and regional banks, we've built out excellent relationships with merchants, with transit operators, with governments and others around the world, with technology firms, with digital players and that really is the bottom part of that pillar.\", \"The idea of diversifying our clients and our geographies, so that, again, we add more legs to our revenue stool and we reduce our dependence on our reliance on just 1 leg, and that's the objective here.\", \"Again, when you hear Craig and Linda and Mark Barnett and Ron talk, they're going to talk a about a lot of how this is done in the markets they are in, both in North America; and in this case, Europe for Mark.\", \"But you can hear the tonality of the international markets through that. And in the Q&A, if you got more questions on other markets, we'd be happy to go through them. But that's the part about getting to new markets with new clients.\", \"I'm going to come back to financial inclusion. Let's talk about build for a minute. And that was the whole idea of getting into new areas of business that are not separate from what payments is, but build on what payment is.\", 'Payments gives us access to information and data. Today, we see 56%, 57% of our transactions that are conducted on these cards. It used to be 49% in 2012 and 42% the year I joined, in 2009.', \"The idea of making progress on that is that the more transactions we see, the more we can do in terms of offering value-added services that provide safety, security, convenience, loyalty, all that. And that is what's built into the new areas.\", \"I'm not launching businesses that are not connected to us. They are connected to payments and rooted in payments, but they build new revenue streams from what we see and do and therefore give us yet more legs to our revenue stool, that's the idea. And those you will see today, when Kevin and Ajay Bhalla up here. That's other Ajay. He's uglier and earns a little more money than I do, but he is also an A.B.\", \"And so when he gets up here, you will get to hear - that's an introduction, Bhalla, you should be careful what you want. So that you get the data analytics, consulting, marketing services and managed services, loyalty, cyber intelligence. You will hear them talk about all this.\", \"The last item there, new payment flows, back to Paul Stoddart again. That's where you get a chance to listen to all the work we have been doing to get ourselves into not just account payable B2B, but also things like Bill Pay. Hence, the work we've done with Bill Pay Exchange or the acquisition of Transactis. You'll see all those getting referred to in building out new payment opportunities for us.\", \"All this is built on brand, data, technology, and most importantly, people. That is what we have spent most of our time on. I'm going to tell you a little bit about the people when I talk next slide.\", 'But we cannot do all this without changing the way we approach our relationship on the ground with governments, with regulators, with opinion leaders and change the way that people think about this company being there only for commerce.', \"We can actually do well by doing good, and that is something we believe in. It's inbuilt in the way we've worked for many years. You've heard me talk about the idea of inclusive growth and financial inclusion.\", 'You will see Tim Murphy and Mike Froman when they talk about this, that they will stitched together for you our objective of being seen as a real partner for governments, but also a real problem solver for their biggest issues in inclusive growth', \"So over the last 5, 6 years, and you could break the slide for longer if you like, but 5, 6 years, I thought I'd bring out 2 or 3 things about us. I've touched a little bit on them, but the first one, product diversification.\", 'We have grown well with debit. In fact, I think between debit and prepaid now, it is larger than our GDV that comes out of credit. You can see that in the top chart. And you see a good contribution to our GDV. And you can also see the growth in commercial, mostly carded in that number that came in the last few years.', \"If you get down to thinking about how we've - sort of have expanded the legs of our revenue stool. Services is not one business, so don't sort of put it all together in one lump. It's comprised of different businesses.\", \"As I said in the prior slide, it had cyber services, intelligence services, data analytics, managed services, loyalty, processing. That's all inside what we call services, but services is today a quarter of our revenue.\", \"Back in 2012, it was 16% of our revenue, and back 10 years ago, it was 6%, 7% of our revenue. So it's headed in the right direction and it's growing well and contributing well to our future.\", \"New payment flows, I just told you a little bit about the idea behind it. The objective that we have is we want to be able to offer choice, and you've heard me say this in smaller investor meetings, choice and solutions to customers, banks, merchants, governments, digital players.\", \"And choice would mean that we want to give them the opportunity to go card rails, noncard rails, blockchain, whatever you want to do. That's what the whole new payment flows is about. That's where a lot of energy and effort between Vocalink, Nets and Transfast and Transactis, and all these things that you're hearing about come from there.\", \"So people. The trends, finding trends and people are very intertwined. if you didn't have the right people and the right kind of people, we'd never find a way to stay ahead of the kind of trends that this industry has.\", 'The biggest transformation in our company has been the fact that the people in our company are different from what we used to have 10 years ago. We had many bankers and consultants 10 years ago, the overwhelming majority. That is still the case, that we have a number of them because they are subject matter experts and subject matter experts are what allow us to succeed.', \"But the difference is we also now hire a lot of people from not just banks and consultants but technology firms, consumer firms, governments, all forms, advertising agencies, because that's what gives us the opportunity to have a really diverse team, diverse not in just what they look like, but diverse in their minds, and what they bring to our conference tables and our meetings, they make us think about these trends.\", 'Similarly, between 2012 and 2018, while our workforce has more or less doubled, interestingly, the majority of our workforce, more than 60% is now overseas. It used to be the other way around.', 'Another little angle, that, that workforce, 3 – one third of that workforce is now in tech hubs doing work to do with user-centric tech design. And that is a much higher number than we had 5 years ago, let alone 10 years ago.', \"So not only have we doubled the workforce, we've got one third of them in tech hubs. We've got 60 odd percent of them overseas. They come from different tech backgrounds, although we value our subject matter experts greatly.\", 'And the way our sales force is aligned is that more and more of the sales force is not just aligned to issuers but also to those diversified list of clients that you saw on the first page and building new businesses.', \"So that's the kind of people skills that allow us - I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this slide because you actually have asked me and we've talked about these a lot over the years. It's the people that make it possible for us to try and stay ahead of some of the most interesting changes in this industry.\", \"Of these, two that I consider to be risks, in fact, that we've always worked with. One being increasing government activism and regulatory activism. That's why the focus on inclusion and working with them as partners.\", 'But second, the whole aspect of cyber, not for us alone but for the fact that the trust in the industry depends on people feeling safe and secure and private.', \"And so you've seen us take some fairly leading positions on cyber but also on GDPR, where we actively contributed in the development of GDPR's thinking. And we are committed to the fact that the consumer will own their data, have the right to be forgotten and the right to have their information deleted and know what is kept for them around the world, not just in Europe. And that is our commitment to what we are doing with a lot of these trends.\", \"So a quick zip through the rest. You've seen this slide last Investor Day and probably the prior one. Martina was up here talking about how we've grown, the way we look at the opportunity in our business, not just past personal expenditure, but also the B2B space where Accounts Payable is a large part of the future.\", 'And most interestingly as well, in the B2B, B2C, G2C, where the business model of some of these is still unsure and unclear, although Mastercard Send is beginning to make interesting inroads in some of that last column.', \"And someone also had asked me about this. You will see this come up in Michael's, Paul's, Craig's conversations. Do not believe that what we are trying to do in real-time payments or in other thinking is to always be the owner of the infrastructure.\", \"That will be possible in many countries. The more it is, the better off we are, but it won't be possible elsewhere. And so the objective is have the ability to offer the free infrastructure capability across cards, real-time payments, ACH, blockchain.\", \"But where you can do them, great. Where you can't, there's still a lot of work to be done with services, and interestingly, with applications that fall into the categories of PCE, B2B and the P2P and business-to-consumer payments.\", \"And so we don't have a single view of how to participate in this industry. We just know we want to be multi-rail, offer choice, offer solutions and offer them sensibly based on what the operating environment of that country allows us to do.\", \"And so last slide, almost, have to do one of these. This is kind of execution over the last decade, nice revenue, nice EPS growth. And thanks to you guys, till the last 3 days - this is data from the last of August. But the last 3 days have been interesting in the market, but that's the kind of TSR.\", 'If you had invested $100 in our company, which a number of you have, a little more than $100, then it looks nice and I feel good, too, in the process, and so do most of our employees. Today, 60% to 70% of our employees have a chance to participate by owning our shares. That was not the case 10 years ago.', 'They feel the pleasure and the challenges of being employed by a company that cares deeply about how we deliver results not just for shareholders, but for everybody who works in our company.', 'And so I’m going to and here by saying I believe that we’ve got a terrific opportunity for the next decade or two, not just the decade we have been through, because of the nature in which P2P, G2C, B2C, B2B, call those stupid acronyms, and PCE, which is the one we have traditionally focused on. Basically, the payment systems in the world have still got a lot of space for penetration by electronic payments.', \"I believe we are trying to anticipate some of those trends and cover the issues we could see. I believe our people are our core strength in that. I think they’re differentiating with services while making sure we offer choice to the people we interact with. We’re determined to be seen as a company that cares about decency, that brings its decency quotient to work every single day, not just its IQ, not just its EQ, but it's DQ to work. And I think that's part of doing well and doing good. And I think if you can do that well, then we can have another terrific decade ahead of us.\", \"So thank you very much, and I'm going to hand it over to the next speaker.\", '[Advertisement]', 'Operator', \"Please join me in welcoming Michael Miebach, Mastercard's Chief Product Officer; and Jess Turner, Executive Vice President of North America Products and Innovation.\", 'Michael Miebach', \"I literally can't think of a better birthday setting. Just joking. So that was powerful. That was Mastercard Send at work, and we'll talk about that a little bit later.\", 'Now I want to lead off with the frame that we have around our product strategy. How do we think about product.? Well, our products are designed to empower every single one of the three pillars of our corporate strategy, Grow, diversify and build.', \"Not surprisingly, we start off with a deep understanding on who we're serving, which informs what we're delivering to them. But then we take a really close look on how to enable the users of our products.\", \"Now this sounds very straightforward, but let me bring this to life to you just a little bit more. So first distinguishing that the who is really our customers on one side, our partners; and then it's their customers on the other side, businesses or consumers. And we believe that in order to do best for our partners, we have to truly understand their customers as well as they do.\", \"So deep diving into consumers and what are the some of the changing trends there? What are they looking for? The headlines are digital-first, it's convenience, it's safety, security, as we heard just before for Ajay.\", 'On the businesses side, very different focus. Safety matters to everybody. But in businesses, control, automation, payment certainty are very different things that we have to understand quite deeply if we want to serve our customers well.', \"Now all of that informs what we're delivering. And the North Star here is a best-in-class experience. So how do we do that? Well, we do that by first of all making it quite easy for our partners integrate with our technology, APIs.\", \"We're also making it possible, we're enabling our partners for a best-in-class experience with flexible, modular and easily scalable technology platforms. And finally, pushing the envelope over the last year or so to really put out there what I would describe as more consumer-ready solutions. So we abstract some of the complexity away from our customers, internalize them and make it a lot easier.\", \"Best-in-class experience. Now one thing that matters through all the three who's over there, the diverse partners as well as end users, is the pavement choice part. Everybody really wants to pay the way they want to pay, assuming they want to pay to start with. Everywhere, whenever and any channel.\", \"So payment choice, how do we deliver that? How do we enable that? I would argue we've already done that to some large degree because we turned ourselves from a card company into a all multi-rail company. So that is the ability for us to deliver on choice and flexibility all the time.\", \"Now for a company that spans the globe, local relevance matters. That's another North Star on how we think about our products. And how do we do that? Some stats from Ajay earlier on, we have the majority of our people in market. We are also developing products a lot closer to the market. The idea is leverage global, scalable platforms but really then have modular solutions on the ground so that our margin management is always kept in sight.\", \"Now those three, best-in-class experience and payment choice and local relevance, you will find across our product road maps everywhere. That's guiding what we do. But what happens when we look beyond our product road maps? How do we experiment with some of the new trends that we just talked about?\", \"Well, MasterCard Labs is kind of leading the charge for the company there. What's happening in blockchain? What's happening in digital ID? That is always a focus for us to see what's around the corner and that's how we're pushing the envelope. And you find a few of those in the build pillar of our business. And that isn't limited to experimentation with technology. It's experimentation with business models. So is there a whole different way on value exchange can happen, we look at all of those at all the times.\", \"Now a $235 trillion opportunity. 2017, I stood here and I showed you how we build products with the frame that we just discussed, that decade [ph] against - participating in those flows and enabling our partners who care about P2P flows or B2B flows or whatever it might be. And we've been quite busy deploying those solutions.\", \"You see our graphic artists here put that in black. That's the stuff, what we showed you last time, and then in orange shows you how busy we've been since. If I just look back at 8.5 months of this year, we've extended our capabilities in critical areas of our business dramatically.\", \"Just last out of the starting blocks, our Nets acquisition gives us as strong additional set of capabilities in the real-time payment infrastructure space. But it's also a real step up on the real-time payment application space.\", \"And that dynamic of incumbency, of having a strong position in infrastructure, and then leading into applications really is playing out, and we saw Nets prove that in the market. So that's very good for us.\", \"Think about PCE, our historic playing field. But there's large flows in PCE that we have not been participating in. And one example of that is Bill Pay. So here our Transactis acquisition was bolstering up what we already historically had in Bill Pay. And then you take Nets' Bill Pay capabilities, and here is a strong set that allows us to participate in this global opportunity going forward. I could go on and on about what we've been doing. You see all of this on this slide.\", 'Now the starting point for all of this is our core business, the grow pillar of our business model and this is always a favorite slide. How are we doing? Market share on the core side, and you see four green arrows.', 'So we are outpacing the market across our consumer portfolio and commercial. You see the reference earlier made by Ajay, the strong growth dynamics in commercial with 13% GDV, and then prepaid, obviously from a smaller base, with some stellar numbers.', \"There's also the moment to point back to how we delivered this growth. And we deliver it through partners. We see the diversity in partners here, the diversification pillar of our strategy. You see banks here, you see P2P companies, you see B2B companies, you see digital challenger banks, all that. We'll spend a bit more time to bring light onto our partnerships with some of these newer types of customers.\", \"So I just want to make 1 comment on our traditional banks. That's still a cornerstone and will be a cornerstone of our business. An example that I find very compelling is Santander. So broad relationship, global relationship, I would argue.\", \"In the U.K., we've just made a real step forward. We extended our relationship from credit into debit. And I'm going to take back from - take a step back from a product perspective, so what's in it? Well, a debit card is a good user experience to start with. But we have our fraud analytics in there, we have our digital expertise in there and we have a full set of our sponsorships integrated in that and presented as offers to Santander's customer. That shows the breadth what we can do, and that is a motivation for somebody to make a such a big step as to flip up a debit portfolio.\", \"Now understanding each of these partners and their needs and their depths and coming to understand what their customers are all about is the focus of our work in product. And hence we're now going to shift the focus and look at what are we doing in consumer and what are those customer end users looking for? And afterwards, shift the focus to look at what we're doing on the business side, on the commercial side, okay? That was an overview, now consumer.\", \"These slides prevent you really from rushing through. There's a real lag here. I just keep - just want to press. So consumer experiences, best-in-class consumer experiences. So that's the North Star. So on consumer expectation side. Think about all of our lives, your streaming service, everything is that the tip of your fingertips, digital first and so forth. And you expect a solution that's one for you and not the same for the next guy that's sitting next to you right now, personalization.\", 'At the same time, you want control over your data, design by privacy is a principle we have across all of our product builds, and then chase - choice and flexibility. Again, I mentioned all of that before, but then when it comes our consumer products, particularly important.', \"Now choice and flexibility. Let's just pick that up for a moment. I presume many in the room are now thinking, well, he's going to talk about cards. I want to tee off and say our consumer solutions are not just cards.\", \"You have Mark Barnett share a bit more later on, on what we are doing in enabling bank accounts delivered through a mobile banking app of a bank to be a payment tool, and it's a very slick experience. So Pay by Bank account is how we deliver on choice on the consumer side. But of course, we love cards.\", \"And there's some really great examples on cards, best-in-class consumer experiences. And the first one that has to come to mind, I paid with it this morning at the Starbucks down the road, the Apple Card. Now that is a very good user experience. It's digital-first. It's a product constructed, allows you to apply within minutes literally and have a card available for your use on your iPhone and Apple Pay.\", \"That digital-first product construct though comes to life across the world not only in credit, in debit with different partners. So it's a contract that we generally drive and engage in our partners with.\", \"And the one example I want to spend a bit more time with Nubank. So Nubank is the world's largest digital bank. So I'm not sure how many people knew that. But by number of customers, they are the largest. They're based out of Brazil. By number of customers, sixth largest bank in Brazil per se.\", \"We have a strong relationship with them. And at the core of what they do as a digital bank, everything managed through an app, is a combo card. It's a mix between credit and debit, and you can switch it on and off on your app.\", 'Now that is a best-in-class user that the bank felt mattered in the Brazilian market, we co-created with them. And that is best-in-class experience. Even at the cutting edge of new banks entering the market, we are there with them.', \"Now I think the word I repeated most since I started this dialogue with you, actually it's more of a monologue, is digital. Is digital. So digital, seismic shift in shopping behavior from physical to digital. We see the growth rates about four times as much.\", \"So our digital capabilities and how do we use this opportunity of changing consumer behavior to capture more than our fair share and make those share numbers look even more attractive for us is critical. So what are our digital capabilities? And for that, I'll get the real expert here and that's Jess. So come on up.\", 'Jess Turner', \"Thanks, Michael. Thank you. So as Michael said, digital transactions are rising in an unprecedented rate, and that's really because of the physical and the digital world continuing to merge together.\", \"If you think about it, really even in your everyday life, we've talked about Lyft quite a bit today. But you jump in a Lyft, you jump out, there's no friction. No payment friction whatsoever. That didn't exist before. Or jumping on the subway and tapping your fitness tracker or your contactless card, no friction.\", \"These are just different ways that things are physical and digital before, but they've come together. And what it's doing is, is allowing innovation in all industries, dining, retail, really every industry you can think of.\", \"In Mastercard, through proactive partnership and investing in our digital innovations is really at the forefront of this. In fact, we're often first to do lots of things. Behind me, I have a couple of the most recent things we're doing because we do so many.\", \"One example is our relationship with Sonic, which is a quick service restaurant in the U.S. And we're working with them to use voice to make both ordering and paying easier. Another is a retailer called goop that we're working with in Canada to make something that used to be a physical shopping experience purely digital.\", \"The other thing I would touch on is our global reach with partners like Adyen and Garmin. I could go on and on but the point I'm making is that with partnership, innovation, infrastructure, we can allow payment choice and we can do that through all types of user experiences.\", \"When we were here in 2 years ago, we talked about a lot of these trends and we talk about our digital strategy was pegged against that. We talked about being able to use multi-rail. We talked about how consumers wanting to pay and being able to enable that. The underpinning of that is something called tokenization. And so I'm going to talk a minute on that next.\", \"Tokenization is really, really at the heart of all of the consumer choice we're talking about, about payment choice. It doesn't matter if it's a card or a real-time payment or a private label card or mobile money account, it just doesn't matter. Tokenization sits at the center of that.\", 'A decade ago, when MasterCard created the framework for what is now tokenization, we understood that. And so we created the infrastructure and technology to scale with where the industry was going.', 'You can see the slide before me that touches on the fact that issuers are empowered through MDES to serve consumers what they want regardless of how they want to pay.', \"Today, and so the lot of it's about cards. If you think about yourself, you may leave your card with a merchant that you like to shop at, card on file, maybe think Microsoft or Xbox if any of you are gamers or have the children that are.\", \"Others may want to use a digital wallet. So with our partnerships with Google Pay and Apple Pay, we tokenize there, too. There's even new places like marketplaces, MercadoLibre and LAC is a great example, where we also empower that tokenization situation so that other merchants can come into one digital place and people can get where they want.\", \"MDES is at the heart of it. And again, it doesn't matter what the payment choice is. And we do that through best-in-class security, privacy and life cycle management. What that means this is in the digital world, if in fact you want to have a subscription or do something, leave your card on file or any account over time, if something happens to the physical account number, it just doesn't matter, you're not disturbed.\", \"Our tokenization solution is called MDES, Mastercard's Digital Enablement Service and that is how we continue to be at the forefront of expanding all the different use cases and ways that we can not only future-proof our own business, but future-proof our business for our customers and take advantage of the opportunity that's available to us.\", \"The one thing I will touch on is something called Express. So I've talked a lot about the technology and I've talked about the infrastructure. So this idea you get to plug in one time from a technical perspective and then reach every use case you want regardless of the payment flow globally is fantastic.\", \"But doing the same commercially is equally as important, and that's why we have this Express program. Leveraging our governance and our framework, we have a set of agreements that our issuing and bank community and our merchants and partners can connect to very easy and simply.\", \"And with the combination, that is how we scale. In fact, we've doubled since we were here to 2 years ago to 2,200 issuers on MDES, and we continue to announce strategic partnerships with the likes of Adyen, Worldpay, Stripe. Not to mention for huge merchants for card on file as a result of this, think AT&T, Liberty Mutual, I mentioned Microsoft. Again, I could go on and on. So this is how you scale around the world and this is how you enable the payment choice.\", \"But there is one use case that I haven't touched on yet, and that's guest checkout. 50% of -- over 50% of consumers still use guest checkout. That experience needs optimization. And that's why in April of 2018, MasterCard made a call to the industry, everyone in the industry, acquirers, payment service providers, merchants, issuers, to support the secure remote commerce standard that Ajay just spoke about. What it is, is it's standardizing where we should standardize, which is about the user experience or the actual pavement and it's allowing us to differentiate in other ways.\", 'The actual standard calls for no static password, easier merchant integration, and this allows us to inter-operably work with tokenization around the world. And I want to spend a second just talking about why that’s important.', \"So with that standard, we can build on top of it and leverage differentiation that we have for our customers ultimately to benefit the consumer. The way we’re doing that is to make sure that we know who you are. If you don’t have the static password or you don’t have the password, how could we make sure you are in fact, who you are. And we're leveraging our fraud tools, like NuDetect and Mastercard identity check, which Ajay Bhalla will talk about later and I think you're an attractive guy, Ajay, so. So we’ll talk about that later.\", 'Another foundational piece that was our value-added services. Being able to show content during the transaction for the consumer or maybe showing Pay with Rewards, which is the way we allow consumers to use their points to pay at any merchant online through our customers. In fact, Citibank announcement it recently, their pay with points program.', \"But even beyond that, it's the experience with the consumer. We have a MasterCard API that allows you, from your banking app, to push provision to credential into SRC seamlessly and easily. And then actually have APIs that the consumer can go back to their banking app and see everywhere their card is stored and have control over that called consumer controls.\", \"These are just subsets of ways we're going to differentiate on the standard for the betterment of the consumer and for our customers. But rather than we keep explaining it to you, let me do a very quick demo.\", \"So this is your partner banking app, feel free to imagine which bank that is. I'm going to sign in. And then I see that I have offered this option. Hey, why don't you will participate in Secure Remote Commerce? I pick the cards I want, I quickly accept my terms and conditions. And because it's coming from my bank, they know everything about me that's needed. So I hit continue, and that quickly, I've just added my card into the Secure Remote Commerce Standard.\", \"Now I'm going to go shopping. I decide I'm going to go KICKZ. COM, I look around, and I decide I want this large blue sneaker. I add it to my cart and I recognize the icon. I go ahead, I click through. It loads every card I have in the Secure Remote Commerce experience.\", \"This time, I want to use my cash-back MasterCard. I hit continue, I confirm my order like you typically would, and it's done. And because of our differentiated assets, we're able to do that behind the scenes safely and securely.\", \"But then I decide, you know what, I'm going to continue shopping and I'm going to get a matching hat. I pick my hat, I add it to the cart, I click again, shows me my cards. This time now, I think I'll use my Pay with Rewards option. I think I'll use points for this.\", \"I turn it on, I hit continue, confirm my order, it's done. And I get an alert telling me how many points I used and what's left. It's that fast and that easy. That's what the standard allows us to do, and that's why we're able to differentiate.\", \"So what I'll leave you with is that the standard allows us to not only differentiate for consumers in a very different way but it helps merchants all around the world. It specifically can help small business and independent merchants have access to best-in-class assets more than they ever have. And because of that, we announced the MasterCard Digital Wellness program.\", 'And the focus of that is taking our assets and making it easy for these small business and really unique merchants to have access to every tool we have so they can build on top of this standard. And that will go live later next year.', \"And with that, I'll hand it over to Michael. Thank you.\", 'Michael Miebach', \"Now these digital capabilities, as you can see, tokenization, SRC, wellness programs, they're all designed to empower scale of our products. But that's not the only way that we participate in digital commerce.\", 'One other example I want to give you is in the context of debit. So debit is the leading electronic payment tool for everyday spend. Interesting factoid is if people decide to use debit in the physical space, they generally opt to use debit in the online space as well. So what we need to do is then essentially all of our debit products out there are enabled across all channels to really capture that trend. And you can see the turnover is two times.', \"Now you know we have a strong position in Maestro. It's a deep rooted product in many markets around the world and has been very successful for us. We also have a thriving business in Debit MasterCard. How do we would bring the two together.\", \"We've been sharing with you cards largely based out of Asia in the last quarter, and we continue to make progress. A recent example is our agreement with Bancolombia, committed to merge its Maestro portfolio onto Debit Mastercard.\", \"But a consumer wants to transact today. If Mastercard and local banks decide we're going to convert over the next 2 years, that's good but that doesn't help today. So what does help today? Here's track two our strategy, and that is issuing instant virtual Debit Mastercards, work as a companion card all along.\", \"Here begin to see good customer reaction from that, our partnership with Nexi in Italy would be one example for that. And of course, I have to mention the German example and that is Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank, believe it, out of Germany is deciding that we should be going across all channel with the best possible user experience, which I'm very happy about. So that's debit. Good story for us, thriving business and continuing to grow fast.\", \"Now last time we spoke 2 years ago, we put a particular spotlight on credit and affluent credit. Sometimes, I feel prepaid could end up as the stepchild so we're going to spend all bit of time to talk about prepaid today. Remember the 19% GDV growth rate.\", 'So prepaid is really the tool that we employ very effectively, diversifying customer segments, new geographies, new-to-system consumers in the financial inclusion space, gig workers, all of that. That is an exceptionally effective tool and is a particularly integrated. The brand business we, have a product construct but we also have a strong program management capability and a processing capability.', 'So if somebody decides to get into payments and they don’t really know how to do it, we have the card and a box, so to say for them.', \"Some of the examples here. This is – this might sound like its some niche business, well its not quite, I give you a couple of really powerful examples here. The first is Revolut, based out of the U.K., digital challenger bank, very high growth business from a customer perspective, 6 million customers and they are adding around about 600,000 customers a month. So that's significant growth.\", \"As you look at their proposition, its all digital-first and offered through the app. At the cornerstone is a Mastercard prepaid card, multicurrency functionality, alerts, auto reload, the whole works from Mastercard powering that business. I think it's a really powerful example to show where prepaid can go and what it can do for us.\", 'Now somebody like Revolut is an interesting aspect. It kind of leads on to a few other things for us then. So banks like that, growing fast, moving from country to country, are looking for different licensing processes for different engagement and for a really flexible partner.', \"We've changed our - and updated our processes accordingly to work with them. And today, we enjoy a leadership position across these fintech challenger banks around the world.\", \"Now it's not all about fintech and digital challenger. Prepaid is a perfect tool for people that hold their first-ever financial instrument. Think financial inclusion. So it's been exceptionally successful for us as a cornerstone of our government programs. More from Mike Froman a little later on, there he is, on that.\", \"But here's an example for you that struggles both, fintech and financial inclusion. So in Asia, we have a really strong partnership with Grab. Grab it's a Singaporean-based tech company, they're in ride hailing, they're in food delivery and they do a few other things.\", \"And what we're seeing here is that the virtual debit prepaid card, Mastercard, is most likely going to be the first financial tool for many Southeast Asians that's historically been financially excluded. So powerful business for us. We expect this business to double in the next 5 years for us. There was the lag again.\", \"All right, so Bill Pay. Think back about the PCE, $50 trillion opportunity in PCE. Bill Pay is a significant chunk of that. And with the North Star of best-in-class experiences, well today, Bill Pay for most consumers isn't the best-in-class experience because it's fairly fragmented.\", \"You have - you log on to different websites and all of that and pay your bills in different ways. It's also difficult for billers and it is not great for banks because generally there isn't much traffic on a bank's website that is related to billers.\", \"So if we were to solve all of that, I can view all my bills in 1 app. My customer spending time on my banking app, et cetera, et cetera. We see this as a huge opportunity. This is ripe for disruption. You'll hear more from Craig and Ron later on to talk about how we're doing this.\", \"But this is powered by Transactis, it's powered by our Nets acquisition, it's powered by a traditional assets. So we believe we have everything that we need to have to pursue this global opportunity. You should see us very active in Bill Pay.\", \"Now I said we will look to understand what's going on in the consumer space, and I'll share some of the solutions that we have there and the progress that we've made. And we're going to shift focus and look at the needs of commercial entities, businesses. What are they looking for and what kind of solutions do we have? So shift in focus. Please stay with me.\", \"So we build a attractive business in commercial cards, Ajay teed it up earlier. Focus has been on physical cards, i.e., the ones that you use at a terminal. And we have SME cards, we have T&E cards, we are purchasing cards, it's all well and good.\", \"The first thing I would tell you from a product perspective that's been a late trend, a very obvious point if you think about it. And that is if you are an SME owner, you're a successful business person, and you hold a personal card that gives you all sorts of perks. But then you use your business card and it has nothing other than expense reporting, that feels odd.\", \"So we're taking a book out of our consumer strategy - sorry, a page out of our consumer strategy and we are premium-izing our SME cards and our travel cards. So that's an important trend and we start to see good customer traction and take-up. We just refreshed our SME benefits in the U.S.\", \"But more now onto the specific functions that businesses are looking for. What are businesses looking for? On the SME side, they're looking to really run their business and not waste time with distractions. And one of the distractions in the world of a business owner is receipt capture.\", \"If you go and buy something and you have a paper receipt, how will it ever find its way into whatever accounting tool you're using? So we're partnering with Itemize here to automate receipt capture. It's an AI-powered data extraction tool, essentially. Launched in the U.S. in July. Good take-up, very interesting proposition.\", \"Sticking with the point on AI, where else can we leverage AI? So I'm looking here at an example out of our purchasing card space. So in purchasing cards, what matters is control and specifically fraud control.\", \"So we have a partnership here with Oversight. Again, AI-powered fraud control tools that ensure that these cards are only doing what they're supposed to do that matters specifically to governments. So U.S. federal agencies and some of our partners like U.S. banks are seeing great take-up on that solution that we've put out there in the market. That's physical cards for you.\", \"But commercial cards obviously isn't just physical cards and it is not only at the POS. To the point about what do you - what businesses generally do most often is they pay invoices. They buy something. So what is happening in that space?\", 'Our step into the world of buyers and suppliers and the world of accounts payable was really - our first step was virtual cards. So in the virtual card space, we have a thriving business. In fact, we lead the market, and we keep investing from a product capability to make virtual cards a preferred tool.', \"So the recent changes that we've done there is making the acceptance of virtual cards payments very straightforward, basically, no-touch, straight-through processing. So we build our organic capabilities there, but we also engaged with another partner here, VersaPay, who basically have an accounts receivable and reconciliation service.\", \"Now across the board, if you could see we keep pushing the envelope, making our solutions better across POS and Accounts Payable. But then what else is there in commercial? And there's a lot.\", \"So let's go back to the $235 trillion and look at those numbers here. $125 trillion is B2B, that is the size of the opportunity in B2B. And 110 out of that 125 is in Accounts Payable. And only a very small fraction is in cards, virtual cards, which we're leading the market.\", 'So the question that we had to ask ourself is how do we go after the rest? And if you then say where is the rest? The rest is in account based payments, from 1 bank account to another bank account.', \"So here we are back to Vocalink, we're back to Nets, we're back to all of our multi-rail capabilities that enable us to provide solutions for our banking partners and other specialist partners in the space of B2B payments.\", 'So what are some of these issues that people have with B2B payments? I mean clearly, trade is happening today. So what is the actual problem? So I call out four things.', \"The first is visibility. So how do you know? As you just bought something in our company and you have the supplier, how do you know how to pay the supplier? Most likely somebody will pick up the phone and call and say, how do I pay you? You want an ACH, do you want in a check, whichever way do you want or would you please take a virtual card? There's a lot of phoning going on.\", \"Managing the cash flow, next piece. So you don't know when your money comes. Depending on the size of your business, cash flow management can have very severe impact if it goes wrong.\", \"So on the cash flow side. Is your buyer sticking to the 60-day payment terms or is the buyer deciding to wait another 30 days and pay you in 90 days? You don't know. What are you going to do? You will call. So back of the phone, which is a heavy duty process and it's not very automated.\", \"Remittence data. Your problems might actually start when the payment arrives. So those first two problems solved still doesn't get you a home run. When your money arrives, you might not know what you've been paid for. If you're lucky, you get an invoice number.\", \"But has it been for 1 invoice, 100%? Was a discount taken, yes or no? That's another issue in this whole space.\", 'Again, you will figure it out by calling and following up and say what have I just been paid? All of that adds up to limited automation. So there is some challenges remaining to be addressed in the $110 trillion space.', \"Now I wouldn't tee this up if I wouldn't have an answer for that or at least a suggestion on what the answer might be. Now we went ahead and we said there needs to be a solution for this, and one that systematically tackles that. Not - across all the bilaterals that are happening between buyers and suppliers and their banks.\", \"What can be a systematic solution here that addresses the challenges associated with payments in the space, but also the associated issues with invoicing in this space? Following with how we generally think about product. Has to be a global solution because if it just works in one country in a world of connected trade, that's going to be challenging. It has to be multi-rail because we just talked about that these payments happen across all sorts of rails.\", \"It has to be data-rich enough so that the whole invoicing aspect and the automation aspect can be addressed, and needs to be an ecosystem. If will - should ever get to scale, that scales through partners because we can't do this ourselves and banks can do it either. So who all is in the ecosystem that has an interest in addressing these problems? So we put all of that out there and there's an answer. And an answer is called Mastercard Track.\", 'So this morning, we went out. If you follow our newsroom, you would have seen a press release on launching Mastercard Track as our full business payment solution. We first introduced the name in 2018 with Mastercard Track trade directory. That was our first step into the space of B2B payments beyond VCM, where we said okay, we addressed the visibility point.', 'Here are the people want to be paid and this is how they want to be pay that was the broad idea of the directory, including some risk management aspects around compliance and so forth.', \"Now a full service. And the full service, beyond even what we have done with the Mastercard Track B2B Hub, which was an outsourcing solution mainly focused on Accounts Payable. Now it's looking Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable. So we will continue to see success in these two solutions but now a broader solution.\", \"The MasterCard Track business payment service. I'm sure we will end up with an acronym eventually on that, but that is a name that we're using. It's the Mastercard Track product family as we build out our solutions in this space.\", 'How does it look? How does it work? This is it. Let me walk you through. We talked about the world of buyers and suppliers. You see the suppliers on the left and you see the suppliers on the right. And in the middle, you see the service that we are offering. Picture a cloud that host these services.', 'The first is the directory, addresses the visibility who is out there – the people that claim to be, about in good standing, has the compliance sorted, et cetera. Then the rules engine, it says, I am the supplier, I want to be paid in ACH at 30 days and in checks for 90 days or whatever your rules are. Very flexible for different types of payments that you receive for different buyers [ph] that you engage with.', 'And then there is a data connection that regardless of your payment charge you will always get, the right amount of data to automate your accounts payable and your accounts receivables respective on either side you are. All of that with a single API link in the world of our multi-rail - our network world. So you can choose which way you pay.', \"That is the Mastercard track business payment service. Launched this morning 8:00 o’clock, pure coincidence, but it happened to be that way. We've been working on this for a while. Enough of the theory, here's an example.\", \"If you have driven here this morning and you went through one of those cross-town streets, there might have been a truck standing on the side of the road and somebody just rolling some liquor into a restaurant or some bar on the side. That wholesale liquor business - that sounds very niche, what I'm saying, but stay with me for a moment.\", 'That wholesale liquor business resides on your people - deliver physical goods and a driver will wait for a payment to be made and it will be in the form of a check that needs to be cut, very inefficient. Manual process in both sides, involves waiting time and it also blocks the road.', 'Payment on delivery will be our first use case of BPS with the wholesale liquor industry, a few more details a little later on from Ron. And you can actually see it in the product showcase. No more wait time and all data in one place.', \"Think about the world's global supply chains. Where all you have such scenarios of physical delivery, that is a very powerful use case that isn't just niche in the world of liquor.\", 'Now from B2B, back to the $235 trillion. Put the picture in your mind, that column that is B2B and P2C - P2P and B2C, $48 trillion out of the 60 are in corporate disbursements. So we love Send. Send powers our P2P solutions but it is the cornerstone of our B2C business.', \"And examples. We have been in addressing very specific customer problems here. Examples are in the insurance space. We had a partnership I think with Allstate, recently with Esurance. But also back to the gig worker example that we saw earlier on in the Lyft video, that's a strong partnership.\", 'So Mastercard Send, a thriving tool for us that we are able to use for many different use cases, but it is our path to participate in - to some significant degree in the over $40 trillion in B2C flows.', \"Now sticking with choice. B2C and Send, Send isn't the only answer. Obviously, there's a lot of disbursement payments that are happening over account-to-account payments.\", 'So the choice point matters significantly. So I want to take a step back now and say, well, we talked what consumer solutions, we talked about commercial solutions, what are we doing in truly enabling ourselves to be that multi-rail network? What is the progress?', \"And for that, I want to call up Paul, who's leading that activity for us. So Paul Stoddart, please come up.\", 'Paul Stoddart', \"Thank you, Michael. It's a pleasure to be here. I've spoken to a number of you before. It's a very exciting topic. And the $235 trillion, as you can all see, a large portion of that flow moves over to real-time payments and ACH routes today.\", \"And there's an ACH platform in every country, and there's almost always only one in every country. So it provides a critical role at the heart of national economy. So let me talk to you a little bit about the opportunity, and then we'll go into the layers, infrastructure, applications and services, in a little more detail.\", \"It's very true that cards have been driving a lot of innovation in retail payment space and will certainly continue to do that. But over the last decade, central banks around the world have started to intervene a little more and drive, quite often, they describe it as a payment modernization agenda, and we're seeing this in multiple markets. And you can see from the map just an illustration of some activity.\", \"Why are they doing this? They're doing this, firstly, because quite often that financial services infrastructure has not seen investment for a significant period of time. But more importantly, they're looking to achieve a number of economic objectives. They're trying to remove cash, they're trying to reduce risk and of course, increase financial inclusion. There is a lot of people in a lot of markets that don't have bank accounts.\", 'And so real-time payments, this recent modernization of ACH really transforms that legacy ACH capability and creates a new platform for innovation, and Mastercard is well-positioned to benefit from that.', \"What are the real benefits? Richer data, you've heard a lot about that; greater certainty; enhanced messaging. And what we're seeing in a number of markets as well is that regulation is driving further investment and adoption of these technologies, PSD2 in Europe. Open Banking, as I'm sure you've heard the term, is increasingly a global trend.\", \"So the real-time, ACH opportunity, as you've seen, is roughly five times larger than the current carded space. There's a lot of flow for us to go after. Mastercard took a bold step a few years ago with the acquisition of Vocalink to really start to differentiate itself, multi-rail card, real-time payments, ACH and blockchain. And I'll talk a little more about the blockchain piece as well.\", \"So from the map, you can see in green, since that Vocalink acquisition, we've made some real progress. I'll talk more about the markets and the customers that have joined the family recently.\", \"But what's also interesting is all the markets that are thinking about implementing or indeed implementing currently, and we're playing a role in a number of those. I expect this global trend to move to full global market adoption over the next decade.\", \"So how are we going to structure our approach to tackle the opportunity? As Ajay introduced at the start, infrastructure, applications and services. By bringing together the card rail, the ACH, real-time payments rail and the blockchain rail, we're really positioned to offer choice to our customers, to banks, to governments, to corporates where they can participate directly in the payment system. That enables us to capture all payment flows.\", \"So the three layers, infrastructure, the underlying rail, clearing and settlement, you'll often hear it referred to as such, allows banks to connect into that central infrastructure and then the central infrastructure connects to the central bank. All banks are connected to these platforms in the market.\", \"In addition to the core clearing and settlement, you'll often see a directory capability. You might not know it's there, but if you want to send money to each other in a number of markets around the world, you want to use a mobile phone number or an e-mail address or a national ID as a proxy, which a lot of governments are using. Then these sort of credentials sit in a directory, and that forms very much a core part of the infrastructure.\", \"In the application layer, this is important as we've described because it drives transactions to the infrastructure, and you'll see applications in use cases developed across all those flows.\", \"And finally, from services perspective, Mastercard's strong heritage and services. We've adopted a number of those capabilities and leveraged that intellectual property in order to develop a service proposition for customers, advisory, consulting, data analytics, fraud solutions, all leveraging the powerful data that sits in the ACH, real-time payments platform.\", \"So of course, we want to participate in all layers. We don't want to create too many dependencies between the layers, but ultimately, there is real synergy between that participation across all three layers driving incremental revenue streams both individually and, most importantly, combined, and that's how we optimize the revenue opportunity.\", 'With that in mind, I want to just give you a little more information around the NETS transaction. So we announced this 4 weeks ago, 5 weeks ago, and both Ajay and Michael have talked about it already.', \"So NETS corporate services bring some great complementarity to our proposition. Yes, they have capability in the infrastructure layer. They're the market leader in Continental Europe in real-time payments. But most importantly, they really bring capabilities, skills, intellectual property, talent, in particular, into the application space.\", 'So Michael talked about Bill Pay. Michael talked about Mastercard Send. All of this capability in the application layer ultimately gives us more control over our ability to drive transactions to our infrastructure.', \"So in Europe, in particular, they have the largest bill payment solution provider in Denmark and in Norway, and they've developed a number of new Open Banking and bill payment platforms that we'll be exporting around Europe and to the rest of the world.\", \"And from a services proposition perspective, Mastercard's strong heritage here from our Data & Services and Cyber & Intelligence businesses, in particular, gives us the capability to take that new suite of services propositions to the next customer base across all four of the Nordic markets.\", \"So let's dive into just infrastructure, applications and services separately for a little while. And we really have, as you saw from the map, come a long way since even the Vocalink transaction a couple of years ago. We're growing across all regions and across all 3 of those layers.\", \"In the last 12 months, in particular, we've won a number of key contracts around the world to advance our strategy in the space. In Latin America, Peru is our country anchor tenant for our new Latin American regional real-time payments, ACH hub. We're replacing Peru's entire national payment system, batch check and, of course, new real-time and a number of application and services capabilities.\", \"In Asia Pacific, Philippines will be our anchor tenant for our Asia Pacific hub. Exciting to complement our existing customers in the region, Singapore and Thailand. I'll talk a little bit more about PromptPay in Thailand later. But the Philippines becomes the anchor for our Asia Pacific hub, and we can support a number of markets in the region across all 3 layers.\", 'Moving to the Middle East, slightly warmer time of year at the moment. And Saudi Arabia, we announced a few months ago, will be our anchor tenant in the Middle East region.', 'Massive national payments agenda from the Saudi Arabian monetary authority, exciting project, again replacing large parts of their existing national payment infrastructure.', 'And very close to my heart for a number of different reasons is our recent win with P27. So P27 - by the way, P27 stands for the population of the Nordic region, basically 27 million people. But P27 is a real first.', \"So this is a group of leading banks, largest banks across the region. Quite often, those of you familiar with the region will know that they're a heavily integrated population. Businesses move between the markets on a regular basis.\", \"Those banks have come together and decided to procure and implement a new real-time payment system for the region, operating in all four currencies plus euro and enabling customers and businesses across all those markets again, both batch ACH and, of course, real-time payments. They're very much at the heart of innovation in payments in that region. You'll hear a little more from Javier and Mark later when we talk about Europe.\", \"It's a world first. That is not happening anywhere else in the world. That regional multicurrency, multi-country solution, I think, is an exciting development, and I think you'll see a number of other regions or groups of countries around the world start thinking about doing something very similar.\", \"That growth basically means we've got live or have signed 11 markets out of the top 50 in GDP terms and often, a number of the largest as well. I think that's real progress over - just over 2 years.\", \"So I'm going to move into applications now. So on the theme, infrastructure, application and services, absolutely critical role, driving transactions to the infrastructure but also touching the customer. If you follow through the different use cases that Michael went through, and there are hundreds of use cases, there's a sample here, we'll talk a little bit about them.\", \"In the U.K., we've launched Pay By Account. Basically from the Vocalink heritage, Pay By Account sits on top of the faster payments infrastructure and drives transactions to that infrastructure by bringing together banks and merchants and consumers and businesses in that end-to-end proposition. Our partners in that initiative, HSBC and Barclays, on the consumer side, bring over 10 million consumers into that network.\", \"On the merchant acceptance side, Worldpay and Barclays global payment acceptance give us coverage of over 75% of merchants in the U.K. We'll roll that solution out under the Pay by Account brand on a global basis. There'll be a number of markets you'll hear more from us about next year.\", \"On the bill payment side, Michael already touched on at the NETS corporate services piece here, but it's Betalingsservice, which is the prime billing solution in the Danish market, provided by NETS corporate services, direct debit. Of course, in the U.K., the largest bill payment solution in Europe. And Bill Pay Exchange, Michael referred to. You'll hear more from Craig and Ron later. So this provides our capability or enables our capability in the biller space.\", \"Michael has talked about BPS, so I won't touch on that. Send and Transfast, in particular, give us increased capability in the distribution and disbursement of funds from governments but also from corporates.\", \"And Transfast, another acquisition we made earlier this year in the cross-border space. They're going to get a little deep dive for you in just a few minutes.\", \"The partnership layer I think is worth just touching on because I strongly believe that we're in a world where agility and certainty and confidence often requires the formation of strong partnerships with complementary capabilities being brought about for customers. I think those strong partnerships gives us that agility and gives us the ability to differentiate in our propositions to customers.\", \"The last point on the application layer is really PromptPay. As I mentioned, I would give you a little more insight into the solution in Thailand. So skip back 3, 4 years, we're standing in a meeting with the governor of the Bank of Thailand, and he laid out a very bold vision for payments modernization in Thailand.\", 'Seeing limited investment over the previous years and change of government, both the central bank governor and the politicians really wanted to make a difference and invest in a range of infrastructure for citizens in Thailand.', 'So their objectives, as I mentioned before: remove cash, reduce fraud and risk in the system, increase financial inclusion. Still a large portion of citizens in Thailand without bank accounts, but they do have a mobile phone. So how do we bring together a payment system modernization agenda for the country that is fully participative?', \"That's how PromptPay's was created. All the banks participate in PromptPay. It is the new real-time payments infrastructure for the market. It's been live for just over 2 years. It has over 14 million registered consumers, which is the large part of the adult population in Thailand. It also will process nearly 800 million transactions this year after just 2.5 years of start.\", \"It's a very exciting proposition, and I expect to see success like that in a number of other markets. What's more exciting is that the participation is across all 3 layers. So we have the base transaction infrastructure layer. ISO 20022 [ph] messaging connecting all the banks in the market, but the e-wallet have been brought into the banking system for those citizens that don't have bank accounts. So if you have a wallet or a mobile phone, you can fully interoperate the banking system without the need for your bank account.\", \"It also provides government disbursements. The government uses the national ID from the directory to route transactions to all citizens, tax rebates, agricultural subsidies. And in doing so, they've been able to significantly reduce their operational expense and increase the speed and certainty of providing funds to those that need it. So I'm really excited about it because of its full layer, three layer participation stack as an example.\", \"So I told you I'd give you a little more on cross-border and here it is. I think we are operating now in a cross-border space, almost entirely driven by our customer base. We're all more mobile. Our customers are certainly more mobile, both businesses and consumers.\", 'Also our proposition supports banks primarily to enable them to compete more effectively typically in a space where, as you all know, have seen quite a lot of new entrant activity over the last 10 years.', 'Quite often, our customers, banks and corporates are asking for a single technology and contractual relationship with us, so a single connection, a single API, through which they can reach a global payment network.', \"So Transfast brings real high-quality business model, strong AML/KYC capability but not only that, real reach, over 125 countries that's connecting into 125 country domestic ACH and real-time payment systems. And as some of you have probably realized, that is some of our infrastructure and domestic ACH system.\", \"So not only are we supporting the domestic flow, we're bringing transactions from other markets to our domestic real-time and ACH infrastructure, over 150 currencies, over 300 banks and nonbank finance institutions connected to the network.\", \"Those transaction will flow, as I've said, over real-time payments and ACH primarily, but also, we have the card option and increasingly will be developing a blockchain option.\", \"If you take a blockchain network and a cryptocurrency, then together you're basically recreating a bank account and an ACH or card payment network. We want to offer that choice to our customers. You'll see us experiment with these technologies increasingly in a range of markets.\", 'And lastly but certainly not least, the services component, so deriving incremental value, enhanced customer traction, stickiness, for want of a better word, through the addition of a services proposition often accompanying both our applications and infrastructure layer.', \"So Mastercard's heritage in this space was strong. And taking our subject matter expertise, our technology, our products in the ACH, real-time payment space and applications space, combining those capabilities together, we've developed three propositions for customers in this space, consulting, helping banks, governments think about real-time payments; or if the market's implementing it, helping them build the business case to develop products and service that use it.\", \"And most importantly, once it's live, how do I make and develop and design new products and services for my customers that ultimately can leverage this new infrastructure. It's been a really strong and successful proposition in the market.\", 'Reporting and analytics. This is MI around real-time performance and participation in the payments network in the market, critical to everyday operational performance and resilience in particular.', 'And then financial crime solutions. Some of you may have seen our money mule solution. It is a really interesting proposition developed by our data science team using AI to track and trace the movement of illicit funds between bank accounts in an entire network.', \"If you are the operator of the network running the central hub, then you're the only participant that can see the money move between all accounts in the system. This gives us a unique proposition to be able to identify the movement of fraud and risk and reduce risk overall in the payment system.\", \"In the last few years, in fact, since around the end of 2015, 2016, we've signed over 100 incremental services contracts to the proposition. And it just goes to show how participation across the three layers really allows us to optimize the opportunity in the market and develop stronger and more compelling propositions for our customers.\", \"So I'm hoping that you'll agree with me that when I have said a couple of times in the last few minutes that we've come a long way, we really have come a long way. So I'm going to hand back to Michael. Thank you.\", 'Michael Miebach', \"All right. We've come a really long way. Back in 2016, he was sitting on the other table when we're negotiating buying Vocalink. So as you can see now, he's onstage leading that business, so that is a long way. And for those of you who are wondering, Paul is not related to a leading U.K. politician. Okay?\", \"So what's next? So we talked about the $235 trillion, how we're expanding our product capabilities and where are we going. $235 trillion is payments volume, but obviously related to that is data transactions that are taking place. How are we thinking about pushing the envelope in our products and solutions beyond what we're doing?\", \"And we've come a long way. We've opened a series of new frontiers that you're very familiar with. So we were deep in card, which is still driving the share on the cost side, as we just talked about, differentiated by our services.\", \"And then we said, okay, to be a relevant partner, we're going to expand into non-card payments because that's what really matters to our customers, that's how the payments are actually happening out there. And then, of course, as you just heard last from Paul, we're extending our services muscles into non-card payments, all very logical.\", 'So the logical answer on where next is right here because the core competencies on expanding these frontiers are all safety, security, network reach and standards. And where do you need all of those four components? In a world - in an adjacent world that is just emerging around us, and that is Open Banking.', \"The world of Open Banking, you'll hear more about from Mark a little later. But basically, breaking up the traditional relationship between a bank and a bank customer and allowing a third-party to come in and use the data and create a whole new set of propositions out of that, and some markets, regulatory-driven; and others, driven by market forces.\", \"We see that world emerging right now, and we believe there's an opportunity for us to sit in the middle, take a few books - a few pages out of our strategy book and say that's a space that needs to be organized and should not be starting off in a series of bilateral that actually cause more friction rather than anything else. This is designed to drive innovation and competition and growth, and I think we can help with our experience.\", \"It's one of the new frontiers that we're exploring right now. We launched our first set of solutions in Europe last year. Another one that we are exploring is digital ID that is also leveraging those same capabilities, and it is stepping into the world of data transactions versus payment transactions.\", \"Let me sum it up with 30 seconds to go. So think about the first slide, the frame of our product. We have different sets of partners to consider. It's our customers and it's their customers, and we are building, hopefully, fit-for-purpose products, recognizing these individual needs. We're scaling them through digital solutions and always supporting all forms of payment through our multi-rail network.\", \"All of that, in the end, lives up to Mastercard's claim, we stand for choice and, obviously, for convenience solutions and also for security, which is, not exactly by coincidence, a perfect segue to ask Ajay Bhalla to come up here and talk about safety and security. Thank you.\", '[Advertisement]', 'Operator', 'Please join me in welcoming the President of Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, Ajay Bhalla.', 'Ajay Bhalla', 'Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everybody. I already got a lot of compliments from my boss at the time of introduction. So here I am. You can see me in real life now.', 'You heard Michael and my other colleagues talk about how Mastercard is transforming itself for the future. The world indeed is changing at a very, very fast pace, technological developments in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, Internet of Things.', \"It's changing the way we live and will make our lives richer and more convenient. However, in this new changing world, what you really need is trust to do business. Without trust, business cannot happen. I'm going to share with you how we are advancing trust to ensure that commerce can happen.\", \"Let me start by sharing a few key trends that are shaping this new world and present new opportunities for us. The physical and the digital worlds are converging, you've heard that earlier, and add to that the Internet of Things. All the devices that we carry, that we have, our homes, our phones, our watches, are all getting connected to each other. It is estimated that more than 50 billion devices will be connected to the IoT by 2025, which creates a huge opportunity for payments.\", 'However, many of these devices are coming with very weak built-in security, as we recently saw, where a number of cameras were hacked on televisions and that exposed the vulnerability of the Internet of Things.', 'The second key big trend we are seeing is the exponential growth in data. The Internet of Things, all these devices are creating huge amounts of data. 90% of the data that we see in the world today as estimated was created in the last 2 years. And with the advent of 5G, this data collection and the data that we see globally is only going to accelerate further.', 'It gives us huge opportunities to personalize, customize and will offer huge amounts of convenience to all of us. What it is also raising is concerns and questions with consumers on how this data is collected, how this data is stored and how this data is protected.', 'The third key big trend we see is the digitally-native generation. This is something I relate to very, very well and for all of you who have young children will relate to very well, too. This generation carries multiple devices, carry multiple equipment, use multiple applications at the same time and want to be connected all the time. They desire nothing else but an Internet connection, as we all know.', 'They are so hungry to consume all these digital services and experiences that they leave a lot of information on the Internet, their photographs, their location details, their reviews.', \"And that's because this generation actually expects that security comes as part of experiences. And that, in recent times, has been challenged by a number of incidents, and that is going to be more challenging in the future with the Internet of Things.\", \"And finally, artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, which is going to transform the way we live. With all the data that we see and the processing power that the machines have today, this will power driverless cars, robots and will power a lot of technologies in payments as well. However, it's also giving hackers the tools to look for vulnerabilities in the systems and conduct robotic attacks.\", 'Now with the changing world, the cybersecurity needs for our stakeholders are evolving too. Consumers have been impacted in a big way by all the data breaches that have been happening, many big brands have been impacted. And consumers are looking for companies and brands that they can trust, and they are looking for solutions that give them control over their data.', 'Merchants, businesses, financial institutions have all been impacted by massive breaches in the recent past. They are investing heavily in cybersecurity. They are looking for solutions that can secure their businesses and can also offer experiences to their customers.', 'Governments have been taking cybersecurity very, very seriously now. We are seeing cybersecurity laws being enacted in all parts of the world. Governments are also enforcing them and actually levying penalties when these laws are breached. Governments are also looking for a number of solutions in the cybersecurity space which help them secure the critical infrastructure in their countries.', \"We have a multiple-layered strategy to advance trust in this changing world. Think about it in terms of your own homes like you use multi-protection technologies to protect your own homes. You build boundary walls, you put gates, you put locks, you put cameras, you put alarms. Similarly, we've got a multiple-layered strategy to protect the entire ecosystem.\", 'Our strategy is underpinned by artificial intelligence, which plays a key role in all the layers that we have. The strategy is also designed to protect all our stakeholders, governments, banks, merchants, consumers.', 'And the strategy also looks at all the rails that we have, the card rails and the non-card rails, which are the real-time payments that Paul spoke to you about, and also is designed to look at as we go beyond payments.', 'In the prevention layer, we look at securing our infrastructure, devices and data. We use advanced EMV cryptographic technology and tokenization to protect us from attacks. In the identify layer, we look for identifying genuine consumers and devices. This layer is extremely important as business is going increasingly digital.', 'Now we know that in spite of all the technologies that we will put in, there are people out there who will still try and intrude, so we have a detection layer, which helps us catch cyber attacks and reduce fraud.', \"And finally, we have an experience layer, which creates good and intuitive best-class experience for our customers. We've been very, very focused on this particular layer because, historically, security has added more layers which has created friction, and our - this layer is ensuring that we can create a frictionless payment world.\", 'Let me now share with you how we are executing on the strategy and how we are looking at the future opportunities. In the prevention space, we have 2.2 billion EMV chip cards which cannot be counterfeited, unlike magnetic stripe cards which could be counterfeited. 88% of our transactions globally are now done on EMV chip, which is very, very secure.', \"In the U.S., we've made huge progress in rolling out chip cards, and U.S. is now the largest chip market for us in the world. Our future focus is on securing the Internet of Things so you can pay securely from your refrigerators, printers, cars and anything else you want to use.\", 'In the identify space, SecureCode did 3.5 billion transactions in the last 12 months. SecureCode is used to identify you when you do transactions on the Internet. We recently launched identity check, which uses advanced new technology and passes almost 200 data elements from the transaction to the issuing bank versus SecureCode, which has historically been used, which only passes 8 data elements.', \"That enables our issuing banks to actually judge the risk of the transaction in a much better way. What that means is more approvals for our consumer, more business for our stakeholders. In live implementations that we've done, we have seen a 13% uplift in approval rates in transactions.\", 'Our future focus is on launching consumer digital identity. Identity is a big pain point for consumers. For all of us, when we need to open a new account or a new mortgage or any of these new services, we need to identify ourselves, show documentation, many times, that needs to be certified. We want to change this. We do not want consumers to remember these dozens of passwords to store their identities.', 'So we are launching a consumer digital identity, which gives consumers the control of their identity on their devices and gives consumers the control of their data. We recently introduced a vision paper which outlined and laid out how we see our digital identity system working. We are collaborating with Microsoft and Samsung in rolling this identity solution out in the markets globally.', \"In the detection space, our flagship cyberdetection solution is Safety Net, which detects cyber attacks with our stakeholders, stops them. We have, in the last 12 months, stopped $10 billion of cyber attacks with our stakeholders. In the last 4 years, we've stopped almost $55 billion of cyber attacks with our stakeholders.\", 'Now we know that these attacks happen because of vulnerabilities in our stakeholders systems. We are now rolling out new technologies so we can scan and identify these vulnerabilities from the systems before an attack happens.', \"And finally, in our experience layer, we've been focused on contactless and biometrics technologies. Contactless is best-in-class experience for consumers. 22% of our transactions in the physical world now are on contactless. And in fact, in recent months, we are seeing that number almost touch 28%. We have been busy optimizing contactless technology, and now, the contactless transaction times have been lowered to almost 0.4 seconds.\", \"So when you are using transit systems in any of these cities, in Singapore, London, New York, you can see how queues quickly move because of contactless. And that's opening completely new category of payment solutions for us because it's demonstrating that card payments is much faster than cash.\", \"Passwords has been a huge problem for consumers. They are insecure. They are hard to remember. Consumers keep very dumb and simple passwords, which leads to attacks. So we've been very focused on introducing biometric technologies to payments.\", 'These technologies have been really embraced by consumers, and we are working on now introducing new technologies like palm, iris, veins, heartbeat to further ensure and create a best-in-class consumer experience.', 'We also are bringing the biometrics technology to physical cards where a biometric scanner is there on the card itself. We recently launched a biometric card with the Mexican government for Social Security payments.', \"So I'm going to now share with you a quick video which demonstrates how all these layers actually come together to create the best-in-class experience like you heard Michael talk about earlier. Video, please.\", '[Advertisement]', \"So I hope it brings to life how we are working behind the scenes and using multiple technologies to ensure a smooth consumer experience. Now we've been enhancing our capabilities and building them organically and by doing acquisitions. We've done three acquisitions in the cyber and intelligence space.\", 'We acquired NuData in 2017. NuData is a company which specializes in doing behavioral biometrics like how you hold your phone, how you press your phone, how you look at your phone, and they have further expanded into looking how you identify devices in the Internet of Things, which is what is going to secure the commerce as commerce happens in the IoT space.', \"We acquired Brighterion in 2017, too. You just saw a video on how our customers are appreciating the technology that Brighterion brought to us. We also launched a fraud scoring solution, Decision Intelligence, using Brighterion's technology.\", 'That solution now scores transactions globally for us and detects fraud. Many of the customers that we have spoken to tell us that the Brighterion Decision Intelligence solution detects fraud 40% more than computing solutions.', 'And finally, we acquired Ethoca earlier this year. We are really pleased with this acquisition. Ethoca is a collaboration platform between merchants and issuers, which helps them detect digital fraud very, very quickly and helps them stop the digital fraud. It also helps them if there are disputes and resolves disputes very, very quickly without going into a lengthy charge-back process.', 'Finally, in conclusion, the world is changing at a very, very fast pace. We have a multilayered strategy that is working and ensuring ecosystem security. The innovation that we are doing in the areas of artificial intelligence, biometrics, Internet of Things and cyber is creating competitive advantage for us. And our strategy is delivering new sources of growth for us and for our stakeholders. Thank you.', 'Operator', \"Please join me in welcoming Mastercard's Chief Services Officer, Kevin Stanton.\", 'Kevin Stanton', \"Good morning, everyone. Thank you, voice of God. Sometimes I feel like a clam that owns a Ferrari, and that's why I think it's really a privilege to be able to speak to you today about something I'm very, very passionate about, Mastercard Data & Services and -- everyone's laughing up here - Mastercard Data & Services and the Mastercard services portfolio more broadly.\", \"You've just heard from Ajay Bhalla about how Mastercard Cyber & Intelligence uses a unique set of assets to make the network safer and more secure. He went light on another fact, that he does that while generating incremental revenue.\", \"Data & Services operates in much the same way. But for us, the focus is on advancing Mastercard's core growth and other priorities outside of security, but we, too, do this while generating incremental revenue.\", 'The goal of this presentation is to convince you that, that ability, the ability to support core growth, while being paid by customers to do so makes Data & Services a unique force multiplier for the company. Bhalla, you took the switch, man. And this was going to be smooth, smooth like a Ferrari being driven by a clam.', \"Let me start with a quick overview of Data & Services. At the highest level, we provide end-to-end services that span from advice to execution. At a more granular level, our services range from data management, which is built off of Mastercard's trusted status in the area, to analytics, to consulting, to a unique form of Test & Learn that came in through the APT acquisition, to loyalty, which drives the right consumer behavior at the right time. And to underscore the scale of our loyalty program, you should know that Mastercard loyalty operates one of the largest point’s management systems in the world. Thank you, Francis Hondal.\", \"We also provide marketing services where we act on our customer's behalf to acquire consumers, drive activation, usage and otherwise, optimize portfolio performance. And finally, one of my favorites, Labs as a Service, where we bring Mastercard's innovation prowess directly to our customers.\", \"Beyond that, we're always looking for new ways to deliver value by leveraging Mastercard's unique assets to partner with our customers to make better decisions, drive better performance, manage change and deliver great consumer experiences. And when we're able to do that, consumers benefit, our banks and merchants benefit and Mastercard benefits.\", \"Five things to remember about this suite of services. One, they're fully plugged into and incorporate other Mastercard offerings. For example, we offer consulting with cybersecurity to drive better customer strategies and outcomes.\", 'We use analytics and marketing service, Mr. Miebach knows this, to drive digital adoption in usage programs for debit, for credit, for cross-border, for card on file, you name it.', \"Two, we are focused on recurring revenues delivered through automation, platform delivery and configuration. Three, our services are enabled by Mastercard's excellent - thank you, Ajay Bhalla - AI capabilities. Just to give you some idea that in consulting alone, nearly half of our engagements are delivered through AI.\", \"And four, very much related, we are keenly focused on maintaining and improving our best-in-class delivery quality and efficiency. And finally, five, our services are underpinned and differentiated by Mastercard's brand, our network and our anonymized GDPR-compliant transaction data.\", \"Well, if this is all a little new to you, you are forgiven. Always want to make sure the slide is there. But if you've never seen this, frankly, I don't know why. Let me take you back to Mastercard's grow, diversify and build framework.\", \"You've seen these services time and time again, along with other services firmly embedded in that last column, build new areas, but that's just part of the story. To understand the larger services advantage, I want to take grow, diversify, build and reverse, if you will allow me. It did it. I'll spend some time on build, but I want to spend a little more time on diversify and grow and follow up with some case studies in those areas.\", \"So we'll start with build. There are three important characteristics about Data & Services in this regard. The revenues we're talking about are incremental. The revenues are fast growing. And as we've said in the past, these businesses are scaling, which is very important.\", \"But a couple of other things to keep in mind about Mastercard services. Access to Mastercard's anonymized transaction data provides strong differentiation, which in turn supports value pricing. Access to the brand and network opens doors and speeds acceleration to market in new and established areas. It also reduces cost of sales. And adding AI automation, configuration, platform delivery, et cetera, to the mix, all enabled by Mastercard technology, has additional benefits.\", \"I think this list underscores something Ajay Banga said earlier in the day, and that's how much services -- the services portfolio is inextricably linked into and part and parcel of every other asset, infrastructure and business line at Mastercard. I'll assume it's nothing I said. I want to go back.\", \"But as smart and as interesting as it is to build new, fast-growing revenue streams, that alone is not what defines the Mastercard services strategy. In fact, the central aim - I am sorry, they disabled the reverse. In fact, the central aim of the services strategy is to advance Mastercard's diversify and grow agendas.\", \"From a diversification standpoint, the ability to efficiently direct innovative services capabilities to fresh field opportunities has accelerated Mastercard's growth in new geographies and with new customer types.\", \"As well, services have been effective in advancing Mastercard's core growth by differentiating Mastercard in deals, by helping improve the performance of existing portfolios and by embedding Mastercard services in the day-to-day operations of our customers, which, as you know, fosters stickiness.\", \"So let's turn to the case studies you saw a little while ago, and we'll start with diversify. And in this case, we'll start with diversification from a geographic standpoint, and we're going to be talking about Latin America. Where's Carlo? I saw that handsome face over there. There it is.\", \"I will say one thing before I continue. Like any other service provider, sometimes our customers don't like to be identified. So in these particular cases, I can't divulge logos.\", \"So back to Latin America. Getting to the mass market, opportunity in this region was it's burgeoning middle class, and stable and stabilizing economies is important to our customers, to the consumers they serve and to Mastercard. This case involves a large multi-market retailer/fintech that had a large portfolio of debit and credit cards.\", 'The strength of the combined Mastercard value proposition won us the conversion of 3 million cards from a competitor. And that is a good story in and of itself, but the conversion to Mastercard gave this customer access to a suite of services that turned that conversion into something more, a growth opportunity.', \"Here, we're now deploying marketing services, consulting, analytics, Labs as a Service and Test & Learn to help this very sophisticated customer get the right value proposition into the hands of the right consumers in the most cost-effective way, all to drive incremental growth.\", 'As a result, we believe Mastercard will achieve a 90% credit and a 75% debit share with this customer. This portfolio will perform better for the customer and Mastercard under the Mastercard banner than it did with that competitor. And the Latin America region will have established a mass market footprint sooner than it would have otherwise.', \"Now let's look at another diversification example, this time with a new industry vertical. Health care has been identified as an area Mastercard's interested in for expansion. Here, we were able to tap into the opportunity that represents with a large U.S.-based health care network, and this is about one of about 600 of these animals in the United States.\", 'In this case, we were able to apply an industry-specific veneer to our unique and very flexible Test & Learn platform to address pain points as wide-ranging as revenue management and clinical care quality as well as marketing. On top of that, we now have a beachhead for other services and for core payments like commercial payments. But most importantly, this service now represents the opportunity to go after a desirable new customer type and large revenue pools, okay?', \"So let's look at how we use services against the grow agenda, and here, I promise, you will see some logos. I said earlier that services help Mastercard achieve its growth ambitions in three ways, and I always think this is worth repeating, by differentiating Mastercard in deals, by enhancing the performance of existing portfolios and by embedding Mastercard services in the day-to-day operations of our customers, all of them while enhancing stickiness.\", 'In the first case with Westpac, we can show how services differentiated Mastercard in a deal. Because of Data & Services excellent track record with conversion services, we were able to credibly convince this customer that converting to the Mastercard brand represented an opportunity to improve spend and consumer engagement, two things very important to this customer.', 'We offered a holistic solution, as you can see, incorporating several of our capabilities, and this was being built on top of our already existing footprint with loyalty and Westpac. In the end, our services capabilities did set Mastercard apart and were key to flipping this portfolio of 2 million cards.', 'With ING Italy, we were able to use our services to drive existing portfolio performance. And yes, this happens to be also a converted card portfolio but one that was operating at something below benchmark expectations.', \"By using analytics, consulting and marketing services all underpinned by Mastercard's unique anonymized GDPR-compliant transaction data, Mastercard was able to take that subperformance to a 95% activation rate, a full 19 percentage points better than benchmark.\", \"I'll end with HSBC U.K. as an example of the benefits of embedding Mastercard services with customers. HSBC is and will continue to be a very important client for Mastercard. Embedded in their day-to-day operations are loyalty, Pay with Rewards, LoungeKey, security and several other services platforms. And they're also extensive users of our consulting and marketing services.\", \"Our goal is to be nothing less than HSBC's go-to service provider and to be part and parcel of HSBC's ability to deliver the best consumer experience. This all enhances the likelihood of Mastercard being a long-term partner in a growing relationship with HSBC U.K\", 'Now before I get off this particular jag, I want to bring a final point on grow. Take a look at our - one of our newer platforms in the product showcase, our Mastercard Intelligence Center.', \"This is an easy-to-use portfolio performance dashboard that's relevant in all 3 areas I talked about: winning new deals, enhancing existing portfolio performance and embedding our tools with our customers.\", \"I'll wrap up by saying I hope I achieved my goal in the time I had of demonstrating that Mastercard's Data & Services solution, there's the punch-line, are fast-growing and support shareholder value, are key to accelerating Mastercard's progress in new geographies and win new customer types and are an important force multiplier for the core business. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your session.\", 'Operator', \"Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now take a short break, and we will resume promptly at 10:43. If you are participating by webcast, there is no need to reconnect. Just stay on the line.\", '[Break]', \"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. We are now ready to resume today's program. Please, take your seats. Thank you.\", \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to resume today's program. At this time, we like to ask everyone to take your seats. Please take your seats, and we will begin the remainder of today's program.\", '[Advertisement]', 'Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Craig Vosburg, President, North America; Linda Kirkpatrick, Executive Vice President, Merchant and Acceptance; and Ron Schultz, Executive Vice President, New Payments Flows.', 'Craig Vosburg', \"Thank you. Thank you, and good morning. And welcome back from the break. For those of you who didn't quite get Kevin's joke about clamps and Ferraris, which I'm pretty much guessing is everyone in the room. Don't feel bad, because we didn't either, and we have known Kevin for a long time. So we've - Kevin has a lot of jokes that we don't really get but he enjoys them.\", \"So anyway, we've spent the morning talking about our product and services strategy, things that we're developing at the global level to help drive our company forward. We're going to pivot now for the next couple of sessions and talk about how we're bringing those to market in a couple of key geographies.\", \"We're going to talk about the U.S., I'm joined on a stage by Linda Kirkpatrick, who leads our activities with merchants and acquirers. And Ron Schultz, who is helping us execute on what for us are new payment flows, and then Mark Barnett is going to talk about Europe to follow up.\", 'So with that, let me start by just providing a little bit of context on the U.S. market. The U.S. continues to be the largest payments market in the world and the largest market for Mastercard in the world, represents roughly a third of our volume and revenue.', \"But it's also a market that continues to represent a real growth opportunity for us and for that reason, we remain very excited about the U.S. and each of the things that are propelling the growth in our core business are present for us in the U.S., and we'll contribute to it continuing to be a growth market for us.\", \"We have continued macroeconomic expansion, that's a driver of PCE growth, and we see PCE growing in the U.S. at roughly 5%, roughly in line with what we see with our global average.\", 'We have ongoing opportunities to capitalize on the secular migration from cash and checks to digital forms of payment with as you can see there still a lot of room for additional penetration of what we do in each of those major categories.', \"Even in our core area, that we have focused on for much of our existence, purchases that consumers makes for goods and services for merchants, we're still roughly 50%, 55% penetrated in the U.S. so there's room to grow their. And clearly, as we talked about in the B2B, B2C, P2P spaces, the penetration rates are significantly lower so that represents a real growth opportunity for us.\", \"And we have opportunities to continue growing our market share. And I'm pleased to report that we are successfully doing that, and we'll get into that in a bit more in a couple of minutes.\", \"So let me elaborate a little bit on the strategy that we are executing against to help us capitalize on the opportunity this market represents. You see here five pillars that are reflective of the things we're prioritizing in the U.S. market. These are the same five that I've discussed in previous meetings with this group. And the same five I expect will continue to discuss for many years to come in as much as each plays an important role, and each represents an area where there is still a lot more to be done to help us capitalize on that growth opportunity.\", \"So touching on them quickly. We continue to focus on getting our product into the market through our channel partners, principally banks. And we're winning share in each of our core product areas, increasing our market share in each of our core product areas in the U.S.\", \"We're continuing to focus on expanding acceptance by targeting new verticals and market segments and upgrading the quality of the acceptance, infrastructure by introducing things like EMV and contactless capabilities. Linda will talk about that in a bit more detail.\", \"We continue to focus on winning in digital and ensuring that we're delivering a great consumer experience with the right level of security and partnering with the players, who are really shaping the digital payments ecosystem.\", 'As Ajay and Kevin just talked about, we are continuing to deliver our services into the marketplace in the U.S. as of means of not only driving growth in our core business, but generating incremental revenue streams.', \"And we're heavily focused on addressing those new payments flows, some of those whitespace areas, particularly the ACH components of that bar chart that was on the previous page, which, for us, represent new areas of payments, particularly in B2B, and Ron will get into those in a little bit more detail in a few minutes.\", \"So with the first of those, increasing our product distribution. There's really three things that we're focusing here. And as I mentioned, we're successfully increasing our market share across each of our core product areas of consumer credit, consumer debit, prepaid and commercial.\", \"And we're doing that by focusing on three things. First is making sure we have compelling product propositions that resonate with consumers, and therefore, are appealing to our bank partners who distribute those on our behalf.\", 'We strengthened our product propositions, in large part, by partnering with third parties to incorporate them into that value proposition. Things like what you heard about from Lyft in the video earlier, with an always-on-offer and always-on-benefit that accompanies our lead product as well as other partners who resonate with consumers like Box and Fandango and Postmates.', \"You'll also notice, there is a digital angle to lots of these partners, and we're looking to incorporate elements of our value proposition that resonate with the way consumers are living their lives. And that's increasingly digital, increasingly wanting and always on, simply delivered and simply realizable benefits.\", \"So we're doing that in the consumer space. We've taken a similar approach for example, with enhancing our small business products with partners like Intuit and Salesforce. That's a first.\", 'The second links directly back to what Kevin just talked about and leveraging the full breadth of our service capabilities to optimize the performance of these portfolios to drive growth that hopefully will outpace the market, which obviously, will contribute to us increasing our market share.', \"We are leveraging those capabilities across consulting, data and analytics, loyalty, our fraud solutions, the full breadth to maximize the value of each of our partner's cards across the full life cycle of that account.\", \"And then thirdly, continuing to focus on wins, and our job in the marketplace is to engage with our partners and our customers to make sure we're driving the growth of our business, expanding our share of business with those customers in bringing portfolios onto the Mastercard network.\", \"You see a sampling of some of the wins that we've recently announced that includes important wins with big issuers in the market, big banks that play obviously, a very important role in distributing our products.\", \"You also see a number of merchant logos there, and that's reflective of the success we've had at the co-brand space, introducing programs like the Apple co-brand, the Lyft program you heard about in the video earlier as well as the one you just heard Steve talking about with the L.L. Bean.\", \"So to talk a little bit more about what's been driving our success in the co-brand space, which is really important underpinning of our growth, I'm going to turn things over to Linda.\", 'Linda Kirkpatrick', \"Thank you. Thanks, Craig. Co-brand has really been a point of pride for us. And it has driven significant market share improvements in the region and having won more than 65 co-brand programs over the past 5 years, I'm often asked what does Mastercard do to differentiate in the space? And how is it that we keep winning?\", \"So you've heard the perspective of Steve Smith, CEO of L.L.Bean. We've really found the formulas for success that works with our partners, and it starts with our partnership approach.\", 'We have experts in the verticals, where we have co-brands that deeply understand the dynamics of those verticals, the challenges in those verticals and what it takes to be successful. And importantly, those folks are working with merchant partners on the entirety of their business, not just the co-brand, but well beyond the co-brand to partner on their loyalty programs on new acquisitions and anything they need to really differentiate in the marketplace.', \"And so how is it that they're doing that? Well, it starts with data analytics. Data, as you heard Kevin talked about earlier, is the foundation of everything that we do. It's the way in which we help our partners, delivering them insights to help them with everything from identifying how their investments can go stronger and longer with our APT Test & Learn capability.\", 'Deciding whether to open up a new real estate location in a particular city, deciding when the best time of year is to conduct a promotion or marketing sponsorship, these are all ways in which we are empowering our customers and delivering insights so that they can differentiate with their customers.', \"And of course, on a Products & Innovation front, we are helping merchants reimagine their point of sale. Think about how the future of retail is affecting their business, and we're embedding our products and capabilities into their value propositions to make them richer and more attractive.\", \"And then from a marketing perspective, we take our assets in priceless, and we complement our merchant marketing assets to deliver customized and unique experiences that they couldn't otherwise get by themselves. So whether you're American Airlines or you're Walmart or you're L.L.Bean, who doesn't love a little priceless in their lives.\", \"So one of the great things about our co-brand products is there's just so many places to use them. So our acceptance network is one of our most valuable assets. And when I think about acceptance, I think about three things.\", 'One is the number of places that our products can be accepted, two is the types of products and solutions that could be accepted at the point of sale, and the third is the quality of that acceptance experience.', \"So with respect to number one, the number of places, you all know that our network is highly scalable, which means we can add incremental volume and transactions without significant cost, and we're doing just that day in and day out.\", \"We're partnering with merchants in emerging verticals, which are under-penetrated for electronic payments to help them understand the value of unlocking acceptance for their vertical.\", \"So in spaces like rent, insurance, utilities, consumer loans, we're working with aggregators like Curb for the taxi space, or USA technologies for the vending space, or Zillow, YapStone and Yardi for rent, to explain to them the value of acceptance and to demonstrate to their cardholders, the value of the use case, and it's really working. We're growing acceptance, growing the acceptance pie, even in mature markets like the U.S., where we had 11 million acceptance locations. Globally that translates to 61 million acceptance locations.\", 'But if you actually think about acceptance in a non-traditional way, where you include connected devices, internet of things, gig workers, even people that accept electronic payments for professional services that number actually expands to 48 million acceptance points in the U.S. and hundreds of millions of acceptance points all over the globe. So you can see the runway for growth here is significant. And again, because of the scalability of our market, this gets us really excited.', 'So with respect to number two, the types of products that can be accepted at the point of sale, in both the digital and physical context, you heard us talk earlier about SRC and in -- from in a digital environment.', \"In a physical environment, we have EMV. In the U.S., we're 4 years into our EMV liability shift. We now have some good traction with 65% of our volume in the U.S. happening in a chip-on-chip way.\", \"And of course, now we have contactless, which is emerging. And in the U.S., we're taking a page from other markets like the U.K. and Poland, Australia and Canada, where contactless has been really ubiquitously accepted for many, many years. We believe we are at an inflection point in the U.S. with respect to contactless right now.\", 'On the acceptance front, we have 60% of our volume happening at contactless-enabled merchants. And on the issuing front, we have commitments from issuers, representing three quarters of our volume to reissue their products as contactless cards over the next 12 to 24 months.', 'And then of course, from a consumer use case perspective, we have the catalyst of transit. And Mastercard is working with 20 cities across the United States to either embed our technology into mobile ticketing apps or to actually launch contactless at the point of sale in transit systems.', \"A few weeks ago, I was in Miami-Dade for the launch of their transit system - contactless and their transit system and then right here in New York, on May 31, the MTA launched their OMNY program at a - the 4, 5 and 6 subways between Grand Central and Union Square. And it's already exceeded expectations. Within 2 months of launching, the MTA saw 1 million tappers [ph] come across their turnstile.\", \"This is just a demonstration of how we think transit is going to kick start the contactless use case in the U.S. And why is this important? It's important because contactless leads to greater, top-of-wall behavior, increased average ticket, increased use and frequency. We know this because we see the case studies from the other markets, where contactless has really taken hold. So we're very excited about this, and we expect that the next 12 to 24 months will be - really, really energize the consumers around the use case and for those of you who haven't yet used the contactless card at a merchant or in the transit system, you're in luck because today, in our product showcase, you will be receiving your very own preloaded, prepaid, compliance-friendly contactless card that you can use anywhere contactless is accepted like Walgreens and Target and lot's of other great merchants, as well as in the subway system.\", 'And so that brings me to third point of acceptance, which is the quality of that experience. We are laser focused on making sure every time one of our products is dipped, swiped, tapped that it is absolutely of friction-free experience for our cardholders.', \"We know the easier we make it for them and more - the more we make the payment process sit in the background, the more we can unlock electronic payments in different use cases. So that's something that we continue to remain very, very focused on with our partners.\", 'And speaking of our partners, we actually have spent the past couple of years through our M&A activity more than ever before. We are working with merchants and acquirers on delivering value-added services to their customers so that they can enrich those experiences, and this is very consistent with our well-diversified and build strategy to provide those products and services in a way that their end users see that value and deliver it right back to our customers.', \"And so whether it's point-of-sale financing to Vyze or enabling new flows through Transactis or enabling next-gen security through Brighterion or new data, as we heard Ajay talked about earlier. These are all the ways in which we are complementing our customers' existing services and making them differentiate for their customers. Again, 100% consistent with our B2B2C strategy in the marketplace.\", 'So speaking about digital, I will turn it back over to Craig to talk more about our great partnerships in the digital ecosystem.', 'Craig Vosburg', \"All right. Thanks, Linda. So earlier Jess spoke about our digital strategy in some of the things that we're focusing on globally. Just to give you a sense for what our priorities are in the U.S. and how we are bringing those to market.\", \"We're really laser focused on making sure that we are delivering into the market the capabilities that enable consumers to have great experience, complemented by right level of safety and security without introducing friction. So that sort of blends together where Jess and Ajay Bhalla were talking about.\", \"And we're focusing on the three primary - really the three only ways in which you can initiate a digital transaction through the guest check-out experience, which we all know can be improved in terms of the consumer experience and security.\", \"And our focus there is on launching the SRC standard, that will enable a one-click check-out experience, that Jess showed the demo on. We'll be putting that into the marketplace in the U.S. in October with a limited sort of trial period with a number of partners, with a broader market launch in 2020.\", \"That's something that we've been working very closely with a number of merchant partners, merchant service providers, our banks to make sure we've got a lot of feedback and make sure that, that's going to be the right kind of proposition for them to embrace and integrate with the intention of scaling that very quickly starting in October and moving into next year.\", 'The card-on-file environment, card-on-file is a good consumer experience. There is opportunities to enhance the security of that, and the goal there is to bring the same level of security we now have on physical cards with the chip into the digital environment by getting those 16 digit card numbers out of the card-on-file environment, replacing them with tokens.', \"And we're working now with a number of partners to do that, big merchant partners like Microsoft and PayPal, the big merchant service providers like Worldpay and Stripe and Square and Adyen and others to get that moving quickly, and that's going to be a really important area of focus for us over the coming year. And of course, we continue to work closely with those who have digital wallets available to consumers like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Google, et cetera.\", 'Turning quickly to value-added services. Ajay and Kevin did a great job explaining the breadth of our capabilities here. I want to just give you a sense for the depth of engagement we have across our customer base in the U.S., for the kinds of things Kevin and Ajay spoke about.', \"Obviously, we utilize - deploy these all over the world. We have a very deep level of engagement with our customers across these areas in the U.S. So as a couple of - by example, our data and services capabilities used by more than 700 of our customers, including most of our top co-brand issuers, who are leveraging what Linda just described to bring a Test & Learn capability, not only into helping to drive performance of a co-brand portfolio, but the overall retail operation or travel operation, whatever that particular partner's core business is, to help inform decision-making and increase the value of that business.\", 'Our loyalty and innovation capabilities, the points management platform, MRS as we call it that Kevin alluded to, powers over 70 million accounts in the U.S., enabling our partners to power their loyalty and rewards programs.', 'We are introducing new capabilities on the back of that. Our Pay with Rewards functionality was recently introduced by Citi as Pay with Points, where Citi cardholders, who are members of the ThankYou Rewards network and redeem those points for everyday purchases, anytime, anywhere in the world Mastercard is accepted.', 'And then with safety and security, the area Ajay talked about, virtually every transaction in the U.S. benefits from some kind of enhanced safety and security and fraud detection capability.', \"Whether that's at the network level with a capability like a Safety Net that's looking for potential breaches within our customers portfolios or at a transaction level, where we're injecting additional insight into the transaction flow to help our partners make better decisions about the validity of any individual transaction, all with the aim of helping them serve their customers better while reducing the cost of fraud. So that's really driving some great results for us in terms of helping to grow the core business through differentiation and generate incremental revenue.\", \"So for the final area for us to talk about with respect to new payments flows, a really important focal point for us going forward, I'm going to hand things over to Ron.\", 'Ron Shultz', \"Thank you, Craig. And you know what, despite not getting the clamp and the Ferrari joke, I think, we've got a bright group here, which means, you've noticed that new payment flows and B2B are big focuses for the company.\", \"And that's absolutely the case here in the U.S. And in B2B, we have a terrific focus on growing that business, in fact, core commercial has grown in double digits across T&E, purchasing card and our best-in-class virtual card solution.\", 'Looking at disbursements, you heard from Paul about the Transfast acquisition. That gives us terrific capabilities to drive cross-border payments and fuel the growth of Mastercard Send.', 'Moving to the bottom of the chart, payment on delivery by Mastercard Track and Bill Pay Exchange are great examples of us creating new businesses and capturing new flows.', 'The great thing about these new solutions is that they leverage existing assets, like our RPPS, biller directory, and newly acquired assets like real-time payments in Vocalink and bill payment capabilities from Transactis.', 'You also heard from Michael earlier about our Bill Pay strategy globally. But what I want to do now is take you a little deeper into Bill Pay in the U.S. and share a demo of Bill Pay Exchange.', \"But before I do that and share the Bill Pay experience to the future, let's talk about the Bill Pay market right here, right now in the U.S.\", \"We, as U.S. consumers, pay 15 billion bills annually, representing $4 trillion in spend. But what's the consumer experience like? Well picture this. Had a household who's sitting at her kitchen table, she got a stack of paper bills here, she got a laptop open to her online bank site, plus 10 other biller websites. Oh, and she has her checkbook out and a book of stamps. She is paying 15 bills, 10 different ways. It's not a great experience for her.\", \"So what that means is only half of our bills are paid electronically, the rest to be a check and over the phone. And of those electronic bills, most of them have migrated from bank bill pay to biller websites. Why? Because bank bill pay hasn't been modernist. It hasn't kept up with the times.\", 'What the consumers want though? They want one aggregated digital place to view and pay their bills. And now powered by Mastercard Bill Pay Exchange, banks can offer that to them.', \"And with that, we're going to bring a few things to the bank bill pay that doesn't exist today. One, it's easier automated biller setup. Adding a pay today is very difficult on the consumer.\", \"The second thing is broad electronic bill visibility, so you can see all your bills in one place. The third thing is payment choice. Today, you only have one choice from your checking account. Tomorrow, there'll be more.\", \"And then last is around enhanced messaging or transparency. When I make a bill payment today, I call it click and pray. I know the payment left my account but I just don't know if it got there.\", \"So let's take a look at the Bill Pay experience of the future, let's move to the demo. So you open up your mobile app from your bank, first thing you do, of course, is authenticate. You mention the bill pay module. Cynthia, the consumer here, asked her bank to find some billers for her based on her e-mail, her phone, her address that she has on file with her bank. Let's search for some billers.\", 'What comes back? Well, we got 1 biller that she has been paying out of old bank bill pay ACME wireless and 10 new billers that we found in the biller directory. So she decides to add these billers and move ahead.', \"The next step, she's going to verify her information for each biller and link her account to the biller, and also opt in to their terms and conditions, and in most cases, move to electronic bills.\", 'The next phase, you get to configure your payment options. In this case, she has a choice of her checking account, or she can pay with her credit card out of her online bank account. She can choose to pay the full balance and select her payment timing.', \"In this case, for Wanda Automobile, she knows the payment's going to be constant. She likes to recur pay, let's pay in full on a due date. Let's assume, we've done that for the other 10 billers. And let's move forward to our biller dashboard. We take a look, all our billers are loaded, but we notice, I'm missing my utility, so let's add that one.\", \"In this case, fortunately, based on her ZIP Code, her bank has recommended her utility to her, Atlantic Gas and Electric. We'll pick that one, we'll enter her account details, again agree to terms and conditions, let's enroll on e-bills as well, verify the account and link it to the biller. And again, you get to choose your payment choices and payment timing.\", \"In this case, this is a bill she wants to review each time before she pays it, so she's going opt out of recur pay, confirm that she'll make a one-time payment each time. And now were done, we've added all our billers.\", \"Now let's assume a few days go by. On our phone, we receive alerts from our bank, one tells us that your recurring payment was made to Wanda Automobile, the next one is that you have a new bill ready from Atlantic Gas and Electric. Let's take a look at.\", 'Again, we authenticate. But first is a confirmation from my recurring payment to Wanda Automobile, this includes a confirmation number sourced from the biller, giving me the confidence that my payment has been made, received at the biller, and my account has been updated.', \"Let's move ahead to Atlantic. Again, I like to review this bill before I pay it. Now I can do it right within the bank's mobile app. I'll review this month charges, confirm everything is okay, and move ahead to make a onetime payment. Here again, we have choices on what payment vehicle would I like to use. Is it check-in, is it saving, is use a card.\", \"We also have an opportunity here to configure our payment timing, and one thing you'll notice here is the pay-it-now option, that's going to be a real-time payment, which means the consumer bank and the biller bank are both connected to the real-time payments network here in the U.S. And the Bill Pay Exchange can enable a real-time payment. However, this consumer decides, I need to select a custom day for this bill.\", \"She chooses October 29, probably thinking it up with her paycheck. And she moves forward, confirms that she has asked her bank to schedule a payment on the 29th, gets her confirmation, which says on the 29th, you will receive another confirmation with that confirmation number from the biller, giving you the peace of mind that your account's been updated and your payments been received.\", 'That moves us forward to our dashboard, which shows us the 2 payments we just made and 2 upcoming bills, so she can do some financial management for the month.', \"So there you saw, pieces of the bill pay system of the future available very shortly, launching in the fourth quarter. It's now a digital and efficient bill pay system that helps not only consumers, but also banks, increase digital engagement, helps processors, helps billers. What do billers want? They want to get paid on time, electronically, with automated reconciliation. Oh, and they loved more e-bills too. That's what Bill Pay Exchange offers.\", \"It's a one-stop shop for electronic presentment and payment, automates those manual processes that exist today with checks and other defects in the system. And it gives the gift of time back to the American consumer. And with that, I'll give this presentation back to Craig.\", 'Craig Vosburg', \"All right. Good stuff. Thanks, Ron. That's - the Bill Pay Exchange is something we're really excited about. I think it's a great example of the kind of application that Michael and Paul talked about that we bring in the market that will be - it will incorporate a real-time payments capabilities.\", \"It's not entirely dependent upon it, but it incorporates it in a way that's consistent with our strategy of enabling choice for consumers, and in this case, choice in terms of how they pay but through an easily centralized capability provided by their bank.\", 'So in closing, let me just summarize a couple of key points. We continue to see the U.S. as being a market that offers significant opportunity for growth. $55 trillion in total flows in this market, penetration rates across all of the different payment types are low enough to give us runway for growth for many years to come. And in particular, that more than $25 trillion that are ACH payments today that we can now go after, particularly in the B2B space.', \"The strategy we've been executing against is delivering in terms of increasing our market share and helping us drive revenue growth. And we're continuing to expand, incorporate in the capabilities that Ajay and Kevin and Michael and others are developing across the company.\", \"Expanding our value-added services capabilities, consistent with the grow, diversify, build strategy to grow new revenues, drive the core business and capture those new payment flows' opportunities.\", 'So with that, we will close. And we will turn our attention to Europe. Thank you.', '[Advertisement]', 'Operator', 'Please join me in welcoming division President, U.K. Ireland, Nordics and Baltics, Mark Barnett.', 'Mark Barnett', \"Good morning, everybody. So nice to hear from Tom there. I remember in 2015, he came to see us, looking to launch a small Mastercard prepaid program with grand ambitions. They are now fully-fledged bank. They have 3 - nearly 3 million customers, every one of whom has a Mastercard debit card. They're doing incredible things, and we're really proud to be their partner.\", \"So I'm here today to give you an update on our European go-to-market strategy. I want to cover four things. First of all, talk a little bit about the European payments market and the potential for growth we see there.\", 'Secondly, talk about some of the market forces acting on our business. Regulation, especially open banking, digitization, and also competition. Then I want to talk about our go-to-market strategy and how the multi-rail strategy is helping us touch more payment flows, but also build out applications and services on top of those payment flows.', \"And finally, I'm going to use the U.K., and I'll get where we've had the 2 rails for a couple of years now to tell you how this multi-rail strategy hits the ground at a market level.\", \"So a little bit about the European payments landscape, obviously, it's a very large, very diverse region. My payment behavior differs enormously from country to country. But overall, it represents just a little under 30% of Mastercard GDV, and that GDV has been growing just under 20% year-on-year.\", \"Over the past 3 years, we've grown our market share in every product category, consumer credit, consumer debit, commercial and prepaid.\", \"But if there is two messages I'd really like you to take from this slide, the first is bar to the left, which shows you our current core cards business in the - across Europe. We're not even halfway through the journey of displacing cash. So we have enormous head room for growth of our core business.\", 'The second message is the other bar because now in Europe, we have the capability to address all 60 trillion of these payment flows. And not just address those payment flows, but as I said, build out applications and services on top of them as we have done with our cards business.', \"So looking at those market forces, I'll start with regulation. It's clear that Europe is a highly regulated market. But what we find is wherever there's regulation, there is also opportunity as well as challenges.\", \"I'll give you a quick example, the interchange fee regulation that we saw a few years ago, brought with it the removal of surcharging. And if people aren't charged to use their cards, they tend to use their cards more, which is exactly what we saw, an increase in cards spent, a good thing.\", 'The biggest piece of regulation we face at the moment is the second payments service directive or PSD2. PSD2 has two parts to it. It has Open Banking, which I am going to cover on the next slide, and it has secure customer authentication. Secure customer authentication is effectively chip-and-pin for the e-commerce world.', \"And it's due to launch - it will be a good thing for the industry as it tackles online fraud head on. It's due to launch on Saturday, the 14th of September, this coming Saturday.\", 'But we fully expect business as usual on Saturday because the authorities across Europe have recognized the need for an implementation period of 18 months or so to avoid disruption.', 'Moving on to digitalization, you heard from Jess earlier that, that we have the right products and the right roadmap in place to remain at the heart of payments in a digital world. I think the other big trend in digitalization is the rise of fintechs in the digital banks, as you heard from Tom there.', 'Our first mover advantage in Europe in the fintech space means that the vast majority of fintechs are exclusively with us, and we intent to maintain that position.', 'And finally, competition, that falls into three parts: cash, our traditional competitors and new and emerging payment platforms. And I think it goes without saying, or I hope it does, that cash is a still our biggest competitor and still our biggest opportunity. And we are relentlessly focused on the cash opportunity.', \"I said, also, we've grown our market share across all product categories, which means we're doing well against our traditional competitors, the international and domestic schemes.\", \"One point, that's fairly specific to Europe, is the presence of a number of domestic schemes right across the continent. And if you think how much we, Mastercard, have invested in our business over the years, a, to make it secure as Ajay Bhalla's been telling us and a, to add a whole load of additional services, that Kevin's been telling us about.\", \"Then I think it becomes pretty clear that our value proposition relative to the domestic schemes is very strong and, I think, that's only going to increase overtime, which is another reason why we have tremendous room for growth in our core business in Europe.\", \"I said I'd cover Open Banking, a few minutes ago, here we are. I want to answer three questions for you. What is it? What are we seeing so far in Europe? And what solutions are we bringing to address the opportunity?\", \"So what is it, it's a regulation designed to increase competition in financial services sector. And simply put, it enables third-party processes, you can see on the left-hand side of this chart, to access the account information and initiate payments out of consumer's accounts, given they have the right permission, held with the financial services institutions that you see on the right-hand side of this chart.\", 'So that raises a number of concerns. How do all the end points connect up? How does the financial institution know that the third party has the permission to access that account? And then what happens when something goes wrong? As inevitably, it will.', \"The second question, what have we seen so far? We've seen a lot of activity in the account aggregation space. So that's big banks, or fintechs allowing you to view all your multiple - all your banking relationship through a single app.\", \"But in payments, we've seen very little, very little indeed. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't know the extent to which this is going to take off in payments. I'll give you one example though that we have seen.\", \"So you can - Royal Dutch Airlines, KLM, you can buy a ticket on their website by pushing a button called Open Banking. The same concerns I raised earlier still exist. What happens if my flight's canceled? How do I get a refund? Who do I call? The bank? The airline, the third-party processor?\", 'So the team at Vocalink have developed a suite of solutions to directly address those 3 concerns I mentioned. Open Banking Connect, Open Banking Protect and Open Banking Resolve. You can see them on the chart behind me, to directly address those concerns.', \"So as I said, we don't know the extent to which payments will take off. But if Open Banking payments does take off, we intend to be at the heart of it. And these are just the first set of solutions. Our launched markets are the U.K. and Poland. We're seeing strong interest for them across the whole of the continent.\", \"So let's move on to our global - our multi-rail strategy, and how that comes together in Europe. To grow, clearly, we're going to drive every day spend, and especially through contactless, cross-border and e-commerce acceptance and implement our digital road map that Jess was talking about.\", 'Incidentally, acceptance in Europe has increased 10 percentage points year-on-year for the last 3 years. Again, largely as a result of lower acceptance cost for merchants, as a result of the interchange fee regulation, so regulation as an opportunity again.', 'Diversification means diversifying our customer base, but also diversifying the services we offer to that customer base. So Michael talked about deeper relationships with our governments and with merchants and our - we obviously, have to continue our leadership with fintech.', \"But also that our services strategy over the years has led to a level of differentiation that's been with one market share and big wins like BNP, and BNP Paribas in France, Santander and the U.K. HSBC are part of that strategy. Our focus in fintech means banks like N26 or Monzo issue exclusively with us across Europe.\", \"But it's the bills pillar, where I think Mastercard is at the forefront, or Mastercard in Europe is at the forefront of our efforts in terms of multi-rail and Open Banking. That started, as Paul said, a couple - 2, 3 years ago when we acquired Vocalink but the recent win of P27 in the Nordics and the pending acquisition of Nets' Corporate Services as a hub for Europe take that strategy to a whole new level, and I'll talk about that in a minute.\", \"So I said I used the case in the U.K. as a case study for how all this comes together at the ground level. Michael put up a chart very, very similar to this at the beginning of the day. The first three rows on this chart talk about our traditional cards business. And there in the U.K., we've had a fantastic run. We've increased our market share leadership in credit. We've increased our market share leadership in fintech and prepaid, we've gone from second to first place in Commercial, and we have become the brand of choice for debit for the challenging banks, which is Virgin, Metro, Starling, Manzo, more recently Santander, and more recently still Nationwide business debit.\", \"The next three lines though are all about our multi-rail strategy. They're all about real-time payments. And there, we've launched a number of applications and services as well as we have a number in pipeline. So I thought I quickly take you through those.\", \"Earlier this year, we launched a product called Send to bank account. That enables us to push a payment to every bank account in the U.K. from our Mastercard's Send platform. It's the first time ever anywhere in the world that we brought ACH and card rails together in a single product. Our first customer's live, it's a payroll company, but the opportunities here in social media, the opportunities here in the gig economy, are, we think, impressive.\", \"Secondly, Pay by Bank, and Paul's already talked about it. We've got the consumer side scaling now. We need to focus on getting the merchant side scaling, which we're doing through partnerships with the acquirers. Building a new ecosystem is a [indiscernible] chicken and egg process. But I'm confident in 2020, we're going to start to see that flywheel start to spin.\", \"Other products, if you were here 2 years ago, you would've seen the demonstration, and it was just a demo of a [indiscernible] detection product, its called MITS on the chart here under real type payments. 11 banks in the U.K. are live with that product, all day, everyday, which is blocking fraud and preventing money laundering.\", 'One other product live Payam [ph] Payam is the U.K’s P2P solution which was build by Vocalink, runs on Vocalink rails and we’re looking at ways to scale that further. And products we’ve got in the pipeline, I told about open banking, so I won’t mention those again.', 'A couple of others. The first is bill pay and request to pay, we’re building that capability in the UK as they are here in the US as an overlay service and that should be going like back into this year or beginning of next year.', \"But one we’re particular excited about which again brings those two rails together is a new B2B product which enables small and medium-sized businesses to pay suppliers using a Mastercard commercial card so they get the benefit of the working capital. But they can pay that supply even if that supplier doesn't accept cards. And in the B2B space, a lot of suppliers don't accept cards. How? Well, it's that second rail again, it's bringing the two rails together. Now B2B is such a big opportunity for us that we're very excited about that. \", 'So I hope that case study for the U.K. brought together how our global strategy not only enables us to capture more payment flows, which it does, because we now have all the account or account payment flows in the U.K., but also build out applications and services on top. But thirdly, make us much deeper with our customers because we are a one-stop shop for all their payments needs.', \"So I'll leave you just with four thoughts. Europe has very strong growth potential for its core business. No doubt about it. Our Digital and Open Banking solutions will keep us at the center of payments in a Digital and an Open Banking world.\", \"Three, our multi-rail solutions allow us to capture those new payment flows and build out value-adding services and applications on top of them. And finally, we've got the focus strategy, we've got the team, we've got the technology, we've got the products to drive long-term growth in Europe. Thank you very much.\", 'Operator', \"Please join me in welcoming Vice Chairman and President Strategic Growth, Mike Froman; and MasterCard's General Counsel, Tim Murphy.\", 'Michael Froman', \"Tim and I are keenly aware that we're the only thing that stands between you and having Sachin for lunch. So we appreciate the opportunity to talk a little bit about government engagement. Why do we focus on government engagement?\", \"It's only for 2 sets of reasons: one, government represent a substantial revenue opportunity. In many markets, governments are the number one source of the flow of funds, whether it's from government individuals in the form of payroll and pensions and social benefits or governments of business in terms of procurement and T&E, governments do represent a very significant revenue opportunity and much of the current flow of funds is still based in cash and check.\", \"It's also a source of indirect payment opportunity and revenue opportunity. By digitalizing the consumer payments, for example, through government run infrastructure like transit, as we've heard about, we're not only reducing the use of cash, but we're helping to accelerate the adoption of contactless.\", 'Now the second major reason we engage with governments is to partner and become a partner and a problem-solver with governments as they try and address their major societal and academic issues.', 'And in doing so and becoming that partner of governments and treating them as a commercial partner, as an infrastructure partner, we help supplement the work that Tim will talk about in a minute around public policy to address nationalism and other issues.', \"We're not new to this field. Mastercard has been dealing with governments all over the world for years. What is new is that we are bringing a more concerted focus strategy and organization to this effort.\", \"And we're really focusing on three buckets of activity. One is helping governments be more efficient in the delivery of services to their citizens and residents, things like digitalizing social benefits and payroll, digitalizing - creating open-loop interoperable systems for transit.\", \"Secondly, helping them promote inclusive growth by addressing a number of their economic and societal problems. Reaching the unbanked or the under-banked. Focusing on particular populations that have been marginalized, whether it's farmers, or micro-merchants, or women, who are underrepresented in the financial system and coming up with solutions that help them address their issues.\", 'And then helping them on their journey towards digitalizing government services, engaging in deep consulting arrangements to help them develop digital strategies, implementations plans, develop a digital infrastructure and integrate with digital platforms into their ecosystem.', \"Let me talk about some specific examples under reach of this. On government disbursements, we are already deeply involved in the U.S., U.K, Italy and Mexico and a number of areas. Direct Express, for example here in the U.S., one of the largest programs of social disbursements, Social Security and other benefits for people who don't have bank accounts or who prefer not to give their bank account information to the government. Mexico, recently, we got a mandate there to help BANSEFI, a program that's intended to reach 20 million Mexican citizens over the next few years.\", \"In 2014, we work with the London Transit Authority to help upgrade their infrastructure and create an open interoperable contactless system. That ended up saving the London Transit authority a £100 million a year in operating expense. But as Linda referred to, we're now working with a 180 cities around the world to develop that kind of program.\", \"And that transit program has formed the foundation now of our larger city possible business. This is a business that brings together mayors and city managers from around the world to work on shared concerns and to share their solutions. It's allowed us to develop products like City Key, which is a combination of ID and payments and access control with multiple use cases from one city to another.\", \"And of course, as Paul talked about, we're deeply involved in working with governments on developing their own payments infrastructure, whether that's in the Nordics or Saudi Arabia or the Philippines or Peru.\", \"In all of these areas, what we're doing is treating governments like customers and as infrastructure providers, partnering them - with them to be a problem solver with them so they see us both as a - being relevant and instrumental in their broader economic and social agenda that helps supplement the work of our public policy on nationalism, which I'm happy to hand over to Tim.\", 'Timothy Murphy', \"Thank you, Mike. So - Mike, Thank you. I'll just talk briefly about some of the nationalism issue that we are dealing with on the public policy side. I think the main message I want to leave you with is that the kind of focused work that Mike has talked about, delivering value to governments whether that's in the digital space or financial inclusion is incredibly helpful as we navigate our policy agendas around the world to make sure that we are heard and that we are treated fairly and that we are welcomed.\", \"And the combination of the two is intentional, and we work them very closely together at the company, across Mike's team, across my team, across our regional partners, because we see an opportunity to take some of these regulatory headwinds, and they clearly are headwinds, I don't want to suggest otherwise, but turn them into commercial opportunities for the company.\", \"So just very quickly on nationalism. Nationalism is something that's in the air we breathe these days. It's in our politics, it's in our trade policy. For Mastercard, what we mean by nationalism is any effort by a local government to tip the level playing field of competition, either away from us or in favor of a local competitor. That's how we define it, and that's how we act as we manage it. I think that's really only 3 things you need to know about nationalism.\", \"One is, while it is in the air today, and it's a challenge, it is not new. It has been with us for 40 years, and we are confident based on our experience that we've got the capacity and the creativity we need to address it and to help manage it. And that shows up in a variety of different ways.\", \"Ajay talked to you about how early on we're now switching 56% of our transactions, so up several percentage points over the last few years. So we're seeing more of our transactions even as the environment gets more nationalistic. Mark talked about some of our share gains in Europe. We are winning against local incumbents, whether that's PN in the Netherlands, Bancomat in Italy, other places because we have better solutions.\", \"There's a variety of other examples as well. We feel good with our capacity and the capabilities you've heard today to navigate - to continue to navigate the trends of nationalism.\", \"That said, there are some important new things we're grappling with. We're looking carefully and watching carefully the so called weaponization of finance, the use of sanctions. We are engaged very deeply on trade policy as that evolves.\", \"There's some upside in current trade policy for us particularly with the U.S. MCA, we're strongly supportive. That would be the best cross-border trade protection and services that we would have, and we would like to see that done.\", \"I think for us the major new challenge that we're grappling with are things like data localization. So this is when governments say we want all the data in - of our citizen rate to be located only in our country. That is a challenge for any cross-border service business. We've got the capacity to address it, and we're doing a whole variety of things to make sure that's the case.\", \"But one thing we're doing very clearly is using our voice to say, we believe data localization is bad policy wherever it is. Europe is not data localization, by the way. Europe strongly supports in GDPR there, cross-border flow of data, why? Because in our business, it makes us less secure. We cannot score fraud against across border, from global fraud and data-front trends. We will have a less secure ecosystem. So part of our job is to use our voice to make those perspectives clear.\", 'And third point is just to say we are responding proactively. Again the work that Mike and his team do that gives us the space on the ground to have conversation with governments is enormously helpful.', \"Just this last year, for example, number of African countries were looking at pricing regulation, some of them had data localization embedded in them, Kenya was an example. We were able to get that pulled out based on our advocacy in part because we're talking not abstractly about what we're doing for governments from New York, but on the ground delivering social services with our key and act capabilities and other, and that just changes the game.\", \"So policy is part of our efforts to engage on nationalism, technology is another element of it. My friend Ed McLaughlin is working on making our technology stack more flexible. So we can put it in more places as we need to, and the great work that Paul started and his team were doing on new payments and issuance and fast race age, incredibly powerful force. Because he is literally inventing and building new governments -- new payment schemes with governments that also helps us. So we've got an extraordinary set of assets to deal with this complicated challenge.\", \"I ultimately, am optimistic that we'll be able to navigate through it. I don't think anyone is better positioned than we are to do that, and it's part because of the great work that you and your teams are doing, Mike.\", 'Michael Froman', \"Thanks, Tim. Our government engagement effort is really part of our broader theme that Ajay have sided upfront about doing well by doing good. I want to spend the last minutes talking about some of our social impact efforts and begin with our sustainability efforts. And I commend to you our sustainability report, which was just issued last month. Please, don't print it out, that would be bad for the environment, but enjoy it online.\", \"And in that sustainability report, we focus on four major areas: one, being the environment; two, our inclusive growth efforts; three, what we're doing with our own employees and our workforce; and four, our ethical and responsible - responsibility standards.\", 'On the environment, we are the first payment company to - we look at how we manage our real estate, our use of energy, our contribution to landfill in an environmentally responsible way.', \"We're the first payment company to have a validation of our scientifically based greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. And we have 100% reliance on renewable energy for our operations.\", \"Inclusive growth, I'll talk about a little bit more in detail. On inspired workforce. We're focused on building, as Ajay said upfront, a culture that is based in decency, inclusion and diversity. And we have a very active, very high - highly motivated workforce. They give out 7,200 hours of volunteer hours a year to 2,200 charities, including to our flagship program Girls4Tech, which has made STEM education available now to more than 400,000 girls.\", \"On the ethical and responsibility front. It's deeply ingrained into our values, including in our treatment of data. And as Ajay referred to earlier, we're committed to applying the consumer protections of GDPR not just in Europe but around the world.\", 'Let me spend a few minutes on inclusive growth itself because our focus has been historically on financial inclusion. Four years ago, we set out the goal of bringing 500 million new individuals into the financial system. We are on the cusp of achieving that goal and are now focused on building on that, both to continue our work on financial inclusion, but also to focus on financial security, inclusive economic development, the future of workers and data for good.', \"Some of this is done through philanthropy. You're all familiar with the Mastercard Foundation, our number one shareholder that was created at the time of the IPO, that's now a $25 billion foundation, one of the largest foundations in the world focused on Africa, education and creation of jobs for youth.\", 'With the 2017 tax bill in the United States, the company decided to take $500 million of the tax benefit and put it towards inclusive growth. And we created the Mastercard Impact Fund, which working under the Center for Inclusive Growth, which has been a thought leader in this whole area of financial inclusion and inclusive growth are now funding programs in these various areas.', \"But what's important is that this isn't just about philanthropy or corporate social responsibility. It's about - because I think from our perspective, the problems are too big in the world to solve through philanthropy or official finance. We're only going to solve these problems or achieve the Sustainable Development Goals or other goals ones might have if we're able to mobilize the resources, the motivation, the ingenuity of the private sector.\", \"And that's why we're focused on demonstrating the possibility of creating commercially sustainable social impact, mobilizing all of our businesses, all the people who are sitting here to focus as part of their business on social impact.\", \"So as Tim referred to, in Kenya, we're working with Unilever to digitize the relationship between a micro merchant, a Unilever supplier and a local financial institution.\", \"So what used to be a cash transaction between that merchant is now visible to the bank, and the bank can now offer a credit, so that merchant can buy more from Unilever, sell more to their customers, pay back the bank, and we're the organizer of the ecosystem.\", \"We're working with garment companies to put their factory workers on payroll, so they can be paid everything they've earned and deserved safely and securely. We're working with Neumann, which is a global coffee trading company, to begin to put their farmers in Mexico, for example, on digital payrolls, so they can be paid more for their product without having to go through middlemen and so they can get their inputs for their production, their seeds their fertilizer, their other implements, more efficiently.\", \"And we're focused very much on digitizing the base of the pyramid. Looking at people who are completely excluded from the financial system and excluded from the digital economy and finding ways to give them an on-ramp to the digital economy.\", \"So in Africa, for example, we're working with the global alliance on vaccine innovation to help track the vaccination of children. Parents bring their child in for vaccination, and they now have a digital record of that.\", \"We're working with UNICEF in places like Uganda to help families manage the payment of school fees to keep their kids in school, so they can graduate, and so the governments have visibility into the economics of their education system.\", \"We're working with farmers organizations to link farmers to global markets, so they can get better prices for their products and get subsidies more efficiently from their government. It's called Community Pass. This is a platform with a single ID and an information layer so that however an individual comes into the digital economy, whether it's as a parent of a kid being vaccinated or being sent to school or as a farmer, as a micro merchant, as a refugee, as somebody who's completely off the grid but still wants to have a digital capacity to save and to borrow, that they can do so on this platform and the Community Pass you can see in the product showcase as well.\", \"Why do we do this? Doing good is the right thing to do, but doing good is good for business. And our focus is on demonstrating that we thrive where there are thriving economies. And sustainable economic growth in terms of growth that is sustained over time is only possible when it's inclusive.\", \"Bringing 500 million more individuals into the financial system is good for business, same with 40 million new micro merchants. And it's that doing well by doing good is not just a tagline. It's part and parcel of our business strategy. Thank you.\", 'Operator', \"Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Mastercard's Chief Financial Officer, Sachin Mehra.\", 'Sachin Mehra', \"Well, Good morning, everyone. And it's my pleasure to see all of you here today, some of who I have had a chance to meet before, others, I hope to meet in the not-too-distant future. And Mike, lunch was here, and it looks pretty damn good right now.\", \"But as the final presenter before the Q&A session, what I wanted to do was just cover off on a few financial items to try and bring the entire story you've heard today together and what that translates into in terms of the financial outlook for this company, how we're doing, what we expect the company to look like on a going-forward basis over the longer term.\", \"So to kick it off, what I thought I'd do is just share with you -- yes, there it is, just share with you, again, how we've changed the profile of this company over the last 6 years. You've heard a lot about this today already. You've heard from Ajay about how we've diversified our products. You've also heard about how we've grown our services revenue over the last 6 years.\", \"But in addition to that, what we've done as a company is also diversified our geographical footprint. So as you can see right here, that 67% of our revenues now come from markets outside of the U.S. We've increased the amount of transactions we switch as a company.\", \"And then last but not the least, you can see that the amount of transactions which we've gotten in place right now going over contactless methodologies has increased fairly significantly over the last 6 years.\", \"And why is this all important? This is all important because this kind of diversification, we believe, makes us a much stronger and resilient company, which is well positioned to operate through different macroeconomic environments. And that's really important. This is not by chance. This is by design.\", \"And I think that's one of the things which I want to leave you with, which is, as this company has grown and evolved, we've really, by design, gone down the path of creating a much more diversified portfolio, which will help us deliver long-term, sustainable returns for our shareholders.\", \"So with that, let's jump into the business drivers. And you can see right here that we've had a solid first half, and we continue to grow our business, both in terms of new and renewed deals as well as our service offerings. All of our business drivers through August quarter to date are growing at a strong pace.\", \"These growth rates are very similar to the growth rates we've had in Q2, as well as those metrics we shared with you for the July 21 metrics as of the second quarter earnings call. Also, we continue to expect that our cross-border growth rates for the full year 2019 will grow in the mid-teens rate.\", 'From an overall financial outlook standpoint, in 2019, the year is developing very much as expected. We continue to see healthy consumer spending with some moderation versus a year ago, and this is as expected.', 'In terms of our full year 2019 outlook, we are reiterating our expectations. Specifically, on net revenue, we continue to expect to grow at a low teens rate for the year on a currency-neutral basis and excluding acquisitions. We expect FX to be a 2 ppt headwind to revenue for the year and that acquisitions will add between zero and 1 ppt to growth for the year. And this is unchanged from our prior expectations.', 'For operating expenses, we continue to expect to grow at the high end of high single digits for the year, and this is also on a currency-neutral basis. This excludes acquisitions and the impact of special items. For the year, FX will be a tailwind to OpEx of 1 ppt, and acquisitions will add about 3 ppt to OpEx growth.', 'So on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. The acquisitions we announced and closed this year are still forecasted to be $0.07 to $0.08 dilutive in 2019, primarily due to purchase accounting and integration-related costs. And as it relates to taxes, we still expect a tax rate of approximately 19% for the year.', \"So let's switch gears and share a little bit about how we think about our investment priorities. This is top of mind for a lot of you. I've heard questions in the past around this, and I thought it'd be good to share some insights as to how we think about our investments so on and so forth.\", 'But before I jump into what we are investing in, I thought it would be important to share with you as to how we go about investing. And more specifically, let me first share with you the philosophy that guides how we make our investment decisions.', 'We are fortunate as a company to have many opportunities that have the potential to deliver solid financial returns over the longer term. When deciding on what we should invest in, whether it be organic or inorganic, the overriding consideration is to make investments that are on point with the strategy you have heard today.', 'And this is really, really critical. We stay focused on that. And while we are doing that, we are balancing investments in a manner so as to deliver returns over the short, medium and long term to our shareholders.', \"Another thing we do is we establish interim milestones for these investment decisions we're making, and this is to track progress. This enables us to accelerate those investments which are on track. It helps us cross-correct on those investments which are running behind plan. And then in those instances where things are not working out, it allows us to stop those things.\", 'And the reality is, as we make investments, there will be things which will not work out. The important thing from our perspective is to stop them and stop them in a timely manner and then redirect those resources on things which are working out to accelerate them and make them come to life. We believe that this kind of fiscal discipline is important to continue to deliver long-term financial returns for our company.', \"Now let's talk a little bit about what we are investing in. We are investing very much in line with our strategy. This is along the grow, diversify and build pillars. It's the imperatives which come under that. You can see that on the slide right here. Specifically, we're investing in growth in our core business. This includes building out our acceptance footprint, you've heard a lot about that today, as well as our digital capabilities, such as tokenization, SRC, contactless.\", \"In addition to that, we're investing in diversifying our business across different geographies and different customers. Specifically, we're making investments in markets like India, China, Latin America, Middle East and Africa.\", \"But we're also gaining more business with new kinds of customers. These might be digital players, including new and emerging fintech players, who you heard about through the course of today. Also, as you just heard from Mike Froman, we are focused on generating revenues by delivering solutions to governments to help them achieve greater efficiencies.\", 'And finally, we continue to invest in building new areas, such as our services capabilities, which includes the cyber and data analytics spaces, and new network players to support our strategy in B2B and real-time payments. These include investments in Mastercard Track, Open Banking, cross-border account-to-account payments, to name a few.', \"Over the course of my 6-ish months as the CFO, I've heard on several occasions about how people are interested in understanding a little bit about for all of these new investments we are making, how should they be thinking about the revenue model. So one of the things we thought we'd do is share with you as to how we think the economic models for some of these new applications would play out.\", \"As we build out these new areas, it's needless to say that in some cases, it's early days, and we will adapt the revenue model and the revenue models will change over time. But as of right now, you can see right up here examples of various new applications which we've been talking about today and what the revenue model looks like.\", \"So in some instances, you'll see we make revenues on a per transaction basis. In other instances, you'll see we make revenues on an ad valorem basis. In some cases, it's a combination of the two. And then depending on the application in question, you might also generate revenues from the card-based volumes, which come as part of what we're rolling out into the market.\", \"So let's take a few examples maybe to help bring this to life. Starting with bill payments. You've heard from Michael and Ron about the work we are doing in the bill payment space. We believe this to be a global opportunity. It's a fast-growing opportunity and has significant potential.\", \"From a revenue model standpoint, a bill payment application like Bill Pay Exchange will enable us to earn revenues on a per transaction basis. Specifically, this is the fee we will charge for each bill that is presented through Bill Pay Exchange, as well as the fee we will charge for each payment that's made over ACH payment rails.\", \"Additionally, as consumers increasingly use our digitized bill payment solutions, some consumers may elect to pay the bills through Bill Pay Exchange using cards instead of ACH rails. In such a case, we will earn regular card-based economics. And that's in addition to the per transaction fee we would get by virtue of the bill being presented through Bill Pay Exchange, just to clarify that.\", \"Another application is our account-to-account cross-border capabilities. Here, the other revenue model is a per transaction fee as well as an FX fee, which relates to the foreign exchange conversion services that we'll provide as part of this application. And that's by its very nature ad valorem.\", \"As it relates to Mastercard Track, you heard from Michael today. We're bringing multiple B2B value propositions to market under the Mastercard Track umbrella. The revenue models here will depend on the use case in question. It could be a per transaction fee, it could be an ad valorem fee, and this will vary based on the use case in question.\", \"In some cases, there'll be card-based economics which will come along with this, such as in things like the B2B Hub, which is a combination of payments made over ACH rails as well as card rails, in which case we'll generate card-based economics.\", \"Finally, let's discuss the revenue model for Ethoca. Ajay Bhalla mentioned earlier today that Ethoca is a platform that connects merchants with issuers to enable early detection and resolution of fraud before it occurs, thereby, reducing the costs associated with the charge-back process. The revenue model for Ethoca is intended to be a fee, which we will charge on the basis of the alerts which Ethoca generates, so on a per alert basis.\", 'In addition to that, there will be a revenue stream which will arise by virtue of a percentage of the fraud costs which we save for our clients in question there.', \"So hopefully, this gives you some context as to how the economic models work for these various applications. Overall, we're very excited about the prospects we're entering into these new areas and expect that these will be important growth contributors to this company over the longer term.\", \"Now I'll switch gears and talk a little bit about our capital planning priorities. The bottom line here is that our capital planning priorities remain unchanged. We want to maintain a strong balance sheet, liquidity and credit ratings, given the network role we play and the settlement guarantee that we provide to our customers.\", 'And at the same time, we will continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, both through organic and inorganic means, wherever - as appropriate. Thereafter, we will return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks with a bias towards share buybacks as that provides us more flexibility over the longer term.', 'So as we invest in the long-term growth of our business and return excess cash to shareholders, we perfectly well expect that we will move to a more normalized mix of debt and equity, and we will keep in mind our imperative around maintaining a strong credit rating for the company as we do that.', \"So on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, I thought it would be good to just give you a little bit of a historical perspective as to what we've done thus far in terms of capital returns.\", \"Since our IPO, we have returned roughly $36 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. And as you can see in the slide, over the past several years, we've significantly increased capital returns, in fact, to the level of $6 billion in 2018.\", \"And we continue that strong trajectory this year, where we returned roughly $6 billion through the end of August. Now this includes the 32% dividend increase that we announced back in December. That's our eighth consecutive year of dividend increases. We had about $1.8 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of August.\", \"In terms of the long-term revenue generating capabilities of our company, you've heard during the course of today about how we are driving the strategy of our company to position us in a way so as to grow at a healthy pace over the longer term. Now what this chart does is it lays out for you the various pieces of how we think about our long-term revenue growth potential.\", 'Starting from the left, we have the traditional person-to-merchant opportunity. For our addressable markets, we continue to expect annual PCE growth to be about 4% to 5%. Now this obviously differs by country and can be impacted by macroeconomic cycles, but this is a longer-term average.', 'Now while we cannot directly influence PCE, we have been, and we continue to do a lot of work to drive secular shift, which is the shift from cash and check to electronic forms of payment. And we believe the growth opportunity there is also in the 4% to 5% range, and this is adjusted for the available market.', \"You've heard through the course of the day, the various examples which my colleagues have shared as it relates to how we are driving secular shift, and these include things like expanding into new verticals, improving experiences through our point-of-sale innovation such as contactless, enhancing the ease and safety of e-commerce transactions, all of which is helping us drive the secular growth.\", \"In addition to these two factors, we are focused on capturing new flows. So it's all the work we are doing in the real-time ACH space at the infrastructure level and the application level. And we believe these will be enablers of growth over the medium to longer term.\", \"Examples of these include the recent infrastructure wins we've had in Latin America, in Asia Pacific and Europe, to name a few, and the rollout of applications like Bill Pay Exchange and others like pay on delivery, which I would encourage you to go into the product showcase and take a look at because it's kind of interesting.\", \"So on top of this volume and transaction opportunity, there are a number of other factors that impact our revenue opportunity, including services growth, it's the mix, it's pricing and of course, market share. Putting all of these together, we believe that the long-term revenue growth opportunity for our business is in the low double digits to mid-teens range.\", 'With that as backdrop, I want to give you an update on where we stand near term. I want to close out with the reiteration of our 3 year performance objectives, which are on a currency-neutral basis and exclude acquisitions made after the start of 2019, exclude special items and gains or losses on equity investments.', 'Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to: one, grow our core consumer and commercial business through new solutions, grow our overall acceptance footprint and our market share.', 'Number two, further expand our capabilities and services, such as cyber intelligence, data analytics, loyalty, processing, which together, we expect to grow faster than the core.', \"And finally, advance our B2B capabilities with new solutions like Mastercard Track and Bill Pay Exchange. At the same time, we will continue to lay the groundwork for future growth in real-time payments by investing in the infrastructure layer, the application layer and the value-added services layer that you've heard about through the course of the day.\", 'As a result, we believe that we can deliver a low teens compound annual net revenue growth rate over the 2019 through 2021 window. This is based on annual PCE growth of approximately 4% to 5% globally and therefore, does not assume a significant economic downturn.', 'These objectives also exclude progress on our goal of entering the domestic payments market in China. We will continue to manage our business to deliver operating margins above a minimum of 50% each year.', 'So consistent with this revenue outlook and based on the 2018 non-GAAP EPS of $6.49, which excludes special charges, we expect that our business can deliver an EPS CAGR in the high teens over the 2019 to 2021 period. This assumes a tax rate of 19% to 20% and includes the impact of continued share repurchases.', \"So just to sum it all up. As you heard today, we're well positioned to deliver value to our customers, our consumers, merchants, businesses and governments as the only global multi-rail payment network.\", 'We have a significant opportunity ahead of us, and we are investing in key growth areas that are on point with our strategy of offering a broad set of applications, services and infrastructure to meet the evolving market requirements. We will continue to return excess cash to shareholders. And overall, we believe we are well positioned for long-term growth.', \"Thank you. And that concludes my formal presentation. With that, we'd like to start the Q&A session with - for which Ajay and Warren will join me on stage. Thanks.\", 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'A - Warren Kneeshaw', \"This is great. So I know not everyone got in their seats at 10:43, so we're a little long. But we're going to allow a few extra minutes for Q&A, but it's going to be a little shorter. And I know some people have obligations to go else. Please feel free to do so. But let's get started. Please state your name and affiliation, and we'll start here with Lisa.\", 'Lisa Ellis', \"Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. My question's about the investments in fast ACH and faster payments. Clearly, the biggest incremental investment area over the last couple of years. Seems - it feels like whether that's interesting and big versus truly transformational for Mastercard has a lot to do with the degree to which governments or our banking systems are willing to allow Mastercard to operate those networks versus simply providing a layer of applications and services on top.\", \"I believe you're operating maybe a handful of them around the world today, maybe a fewer than you were hoping for 3 years ago when you bought Vocalink. Can you just talk a bit about what your aspirations are and expectations are around operating the infrastructure around fast ACH and how important that is to your long-term growth strategy? Thank you.\", 'Ajay Banga', \"So let me give it a crack, and then I'll pass it on to Paul, since Paul kind of looks like Boris Johnson and talks about this. So I have a funny story about Paul for a separate conversation. But I don't actually agree that we've got less number of places we are operating the infrastructure on than what we thought when we got Vocalink.\", \"My whole ambition around getting to infrastructure is that it will take time. These are long sales cycles. Typically, there's a government at the other end with an entrenched player providing some form of infrastructure. There's RFPs, there's processes. Nothing moves quickly in that process. I actually think we had made more progress than I thought because it ended up with hubs conveniently positioned in each of the major continental areas.\", \"So we can use those hubs to go further into other markets without rebuilding the same expense base for every single more new market that we may win over the next few years. That's kind of the first part about that.\", \"The second part to me is that I don't yet know enough about this business's dynamics over the next 10 years to tell you whether we'll make more money from applications and services or we'll make more money from infrastructure. But I do know that if we're lucky enough to have all of them in markets, we will have a really strong impregnable position over many years to come.\", \"To the extent we run only one or two or three of those, we could make money quicker probably, but I'm not sure it's the best thing for us over the next decade. And I'm really fixated on real-time payments as being our opportunity along with the blockchain to expand who we are, get past card rails to being this true multi-rail company that has the next 20, 30 years, directly fixed in our sites as compared to what we had 10 years ago. But I think we were basically a credit and debit card processing player. That has changed completely. And I think we're on a journey that's got another long run rate to go with. Paul?\", 'Paul Stoddart', 'Yes. Just to provide some...', 'Ajay Banga', \"You can stand up, Paul, just to make people remember who you are, which is a Boris Johnson look as I said. My driver in London - Paul, I got to tell this story. Paul was in the wrong hotel, pretending to know his way around London. Considering he's a Brit, he doesn't know anything about London.\", \"And I call him and say, you're in the wrong hotel, and I'm willing to guess I know which one it is, and he said, absolutely. So we drive up in this car driven by a driver, who said, Oh my God! Boris Johnson is standing there on the roadside. And that's a British driver.\", 'Paul Stoddart', \"He's let his hair grow now, Boris, as you might've seen. I cut mine. So really just to support what Ajay said, but I think when we started the journey, we weren't sure how many countries were going to support an operating model. And certainly, as Vocalink prior, it had been primarily licensing.\", \"But with Thailand, that was our first - on the cusp of the acquisition, it was our first hybrid deal where it's licensing and some transaction fees. But of the recent wins I announced, only one of those is a license deal. All the rest are operate deals. So Peru, Philippines, the P27, they're all full operate. So we're actually running the services in the regions. And only Saudi Arabia is a licensing deal.\", \"So I think Highlight Youth wasn't sure what it was going to be like when we got out there under the Mastercard brand with the distribution capability. But I've obviously been delighted.\", \"I think the other part of that is to note that all of those wins include multiple layers rather than just one layer in the infrastructure, which was typically the software licensing prior. So again, I think we set out with a mission to deliver across all 3 layers. And I've been pleasantly surprised to be able to say that all of those include multiple layers.\", \"We've even gone back to some of our software customers and said, we've now got capability in other layers, are you interested? And you'll hear more about that probably in the next 12 months.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'David?', 'David Togut', 'David Togut, Evercore ISI. As you build out your B2B business, especially with the capability of Mastercard Track, how you build out the distribution? For example, in traditional C2B, you work through the merchant acquirers. A number of them are building out capability in B2B. But how is the distribution model different B2B versus traditional C2B business?', 'Ajay Banga', 'Mr. Anderson. Go for it.', 'James Anderson', 'Okay. Thanks, Ajay.', 'Ajay Banga', 'Also another Brit, unfortunately, but what the hell.', 'James Anderson', \"We're doubly blessed today. So I think our approach to distribution in B2B is to actually cast a very wide net because we think B2B is complex along multiple dimensions. We're obviously going to have a global proposition. So there's always a multi-country dimension to it, but there's also size of enterprise. So big enterprises deal with different types of vendors and look for different types of solutions.\", \"So you might have seen on the slide, we've got this layer which we call the suppliers payment agent and the buyers payment agent. So we're definitely going to work with our banks. We're going to work with our acquirers. We're also going to work with fintechs. And we're also seeing lots of opportunity with sort of pure software and services providers.\", \"So we're deliberately casting a very wide net because we think that the range of solution providers is going to be large. And our whole strategy is to embed our value proposition into their value proposition. So we want a lot of diversity there.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Great. Tien-Tsin?', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', \"Thank you, Warren. It's Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. I wanted to ask if we could see Mastercard run more applications where you control the customer experience like a Transfast, like Bill Pay Exchange, Remittance and EBPP. Those are new markets. You're touching the customer. I'm curious why own that? And why do you think you can run that better than the incumbents?\", \"And then my second question, if you don't mind, is for Sachin. I get this question a lot. Just services and the margins, can you give us an update on maybe where you are with the margins as that business is now 26% of revenue? Thanks.\", 'Ajay Banga', 'So Tien-Tsin, I think the first question actually has been evolving over time in the company. In the beginning, 10 years back, 12 years back that I can recall, 10 years ago, even our current card products, even our World Elite card product had been rolled out in such a way that the commonality of feature functionality varied in a marketplace across each bank.', \"And that is to create a very difficult task for us to get consumers to get a singular experience out of a Mastercard product. You roll that forward into the digital space and into these new payment areas. And I think if you were to just build a rail and let everyone do things with it as they wanted, you'd again have a very, I would think, uneven rollout.\", \"So in some of these, where we think that we can actually produce a more thoughtful, full experience and give it packaged to a bank in the case of Bill Pay, when they're trying to do that, I suspect a number of institutions that add features on to it still, over and beyond that, but we're trying to make sure that the building block we're giving them is adequate quality and adequate experience to make it pretty cool. That we are trying to do much more than we used to do in the past.\", 'And in the - even in the traditional card products, so the case of the World Elite, for example, in Europe, Javier has done incredible work in the region on getting a much more unified World Elite set of benefits across European markets, not just in our country. That enables us to do much better advertising, much better communication to merchants, much clearer communication to regulators about the value of the product.', \"And so we're trying to change that over some time without becoming a direct-to-consumer company, without trying to interfere in what the merchant, bank, government wants to do with this consumer. That's kind of where we are going.\", \"So yes, you will see some of that in our build as we go along. Not just in the couple of examples you saw, you'll probably see that coming along in a number of other ideas.\", 'Sachin Mehra', \"So Tien-Tsin, on your question around margins. I'm not going to share with you specific margins for various services capabilities. What I will tell you is, as you heard from Kevin and Ajay, what we are focused on is driving recurring revenue streams out of the various capabilities we're building on the services side.\", \"We're platformizing that business more, and all of this is lending towards helping to [indiscernible] for an accretion of margins as we go rolling out those capabilities from a services perspective.\", \"The one other thought I'm going to leave you with is you've got to remember that a lot of what we're doing on the services side is around powering the core. And when we think about margins, we think about margins for the services capabilities, but also the impact it has in terms of powering the core. So we think about that more holistically though.\", 'Ajay Banga', \"I'm going to do a little further than Sachin does. So I would tell you that inside this thing that's called services, which is all these different businesses, there are some that had actually got better margins than our total company, others that are lower, but in general, if you were to put a hat on about looking - this hat on, on to checking out all of those, we are probably making enough progress in the positive direction on services.\", \"Two, three, four years ago, when Martina and I were standing up here and talking to you about services, we were much lower in services margins down the core. That gap has narrowed, and it's a good thing. I have no way to tell you whether it will become the same or change because each of these new services starts being more bespoke and lower margin and tends to improve that profile over the course of the next 2 to 3, 4 years.\", \"So it's got a lead lag in it. There are only a few musicians like this ugly Bhalla, who sometimes produces better products to start with right at the beginning, but he's the ugly guy. Yes.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Great. Andrew?', 'Andrew Jeffrey', 'Thanks. Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Question, Ajay, about contactless, particularly in the U.S. The U.S. payments market is, with regard to debit, further advanced than a lot of other markets.', \"So as contactless rolls out, do you see that as potentially cannibalizing existing debit volume? Or do you think it's actually additive? And if it's the latter, why and how quickly you think that can be the case?\", 'Ajay Banga', 'Mr. Vosburg?', 'Craig Vosburg', \"I would say a couple of things. First of all, it's important to recognize contactless is just the means through which the transaction's initiated. It's still pulling funds from a debit account, a credit account that underlies - it might be through the card, it might be through a phone. So it doesn't really necessarily change the mix in terms of the products that underlie the contactless technology.\", \"What we do see, though, not just in the U.S., but in markets all around the world is as contactless gains momentum with consumers, consumers really like contactless. It's a great experience. So the product that they're using to initiate contactless transactions enjoys the benefit of greater usage. We've seen in the U.S., just in the limited experience we have to date, increases in spend on the order of 50% once consumers begin using the card contactlessly.\", \"So it's a great means of sort of changing the attractiveness and the appeal. It also reduces the rate of attrition for those cards. So these are very important things for our bank partners to recognize, and it's why they're getting behind contactless and getting cards out in the marketplace now quickly in the millions in the U.S. into an environment where, as Linda said, we've got 60% of our transaction volume being initiated at merchants that already have contactless terminals.\", 'So think of it as the form factor that drives engagement, not something - or the initiation technique, I should say, that drives engagement, not something that changes the underlying mix of how a transaction is funded.', 'Ajay Banga', \"In a number of markets, it tends to go at small ticket sizes, the ones we get the most attracted to contactless, a coffee, a newspaper, a train ticket, a bus ticket. If those markets were cash, in those markets, you'd actually find incredibly improved penetration of electronic payments in those markets.\", 'Like some of the European markets went through a very quick cycle of moving into contactless in central eastern Europe, and that was all aimed at displacing cash for small ticket transactions, right?', 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Can I ask Bryan over here on the left?', 'Bryan Keane', \"Hi. It's Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. I'm just thinking about the ACH market, as you guys - $139 trillion market. As you push more to get into that space, does that accelerate volumes? Can you guys even accelerate the speed of ACH?\", \"And what I'm thinking about is, is could there be a negative mix shift in yields as maybe you push some other volumes that might have gone to more higher-yield products over to ACH. Does that potentially lower yields and lower the mix on that?\", 'Ajay Banga', 'Yes. Look, I think the only case so that last case could come through, Bryan, is if ACH or real-time payments become very large at a point of sale, physical in particular or even digital, where they start replacing what could be high yield products in the form of credit and debit cards that are today being used.', \"The challenge with getting real-time payments to point of sale is actually quite interesting. We're doing it in a number of markets. We've got it going in the U.K. It's not easy. And the reason for that is in a number of these markets, actually debit interchange hasn't been regulated. It has reduced the attractiveness and the oil in the engine, if you so - sort of go towards that common way of thinking, to enable the investment that's required to expand acceptance of the point-of-sale for a pay-by-account feature.\", \"So in a funny kind of way, what could have been one of the use cases for real-time payments is actually handicapped by lack of economic momentum behind it for all the players in the ecosystem to drive even harder towards it. That's an interesting circumstance.\", \"So because as far as the debit card doesn't work perfectly well, kind of works. And if it's attached to a phone and it's contactless, it works fine too, although I still think the card works better. But if you were to look at the bigger picture there, that's the issue.\", \"And I think there'll be submarkets where real-time payments will do better at a point-of-sale over the next 5, 7, 8 years, there'll be others where they won't. And I would just say I'm not fussed about that right now. I think the opportunity for growth, both where cards can grow as well as our ACH and real-time payments can grow, are so large and so incredibly opportunistic that I just don't see this as an issue for this company.\", \"I've had this question about yield challenges in our company for years. And over the last 10 years, we've grown our yield every year. And that's because it's a question of mix, geography, services, product, and there's enough cards to play with, no pun intended, in that game for you to keep a healthy yield mix in our company. It's a mathematical business, our company. And if you understand some math, then we're in pretty good shape as a manager.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Can you go to Darrin here in the front?', 'Darrin Peller', \"Thanks, guys. It's Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. I just really want to ask about what we get asked often around wallets around the world. And obviously, you've touched on it in partnerships, some of the fintech companies, but how should we really think about your ability to have opportunity in emerging markets, where growth of Paytm and Alipay and others are proliferating?\", 'Are you - do you see enough opportunity for you guys to either partner with them or really just grow in other ways in those markets to offset that?', 'Ajay Banga', \"I'm going to give it to Johan and Mr. Ling Hai, since we've got our digital head and our Mr. Asia. So go ahead.\", 'Johan Gerber', \"Yes, good. Johan Gerber. So, look, yes. We look at these digital wallets all over the world in broadly similar terms, which is we kind of know that they offer great experiences to consumers, and they'll continue to do so. We know that as they want to grow, they will need to access more consumer funding sources and more merchants. And that has to be a very difficult thing to do if you want to grow cross-border in multiple markets because all markets have different regulatory regimes. All markets have different infrastructure on the merchant side.\", \"And the third thing that we know about them is that essentially payment is not a zero-sum game. It's not because they gain traction that we lose. In general, the payments that they displace are not necessarily car payments, these are other payments.\", \"And so you put these things together and actually, there is a very obvious place for us to partner. I have yet to come across a player whereby we haven't found any common grounds to partner.\", \"And I believe strongly, whether it's on the consumer side, enabling funding accounts for them or on the acceptance side, or on the services side around it, we always find areas to partner. That has been so with the West Coast players. I am convinced that will be so with Asian players, with telcos in Africa. And I think we're only seeing the beginning of this right now. Ling Hai, do you want to add to that?\", 'Ling Hai', \"Thank you. Yes. So in the region, in Asia, we see definitely a stronger shift from close loop to open loop, right? A close loop may work well within a specific segment or in the domestic setting when these digital players are becoming regional in nature or even global and they're going overseas. Especially for cross-border, open loop is the way to go.\", \"I have a strong belief. As we talk to these players, they see the benefits of open loop. So we have clear examples in Asia, whether it's Grab, whether it's Paytm. There's partnerships. That's the name of the game. And I think the partnerships can take different forms. We have the acceptance side, collaboration we can do with them. There's also clearly the issuing of debit and prepaid as a way to go open loop.\", 'We have our Send product, which is very compelling for credit card bill payment, which these players like. And more importantly, I think this whole thing about looking at co-branding is a great way to go. Apple Card in the U.S sets a great example for these players as to how they should think about form factors.', \"So I see tremendous opportunities actually. It's only when we don't partner with them, they potentially go with somebody else or they become or competitor, but that is not what we're seeing right now.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Great. Ramsey?', 'Ramsey El-Assal', 'Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. I wanted to ask about SRC. And tell us about the distribution and rollout process of that product? Is it a question of having to go out and sign up individual merchants? Or can you lever distribution partners there?', 'And then just really quickly, a little bit more color on that 19% prepaid growth. That was above my expectations and any additional commentary on that would be appreciated.', 'Ajay Banga', \"Okay. So on the prepaid, I'm going to pass that on to Michael, and on to SRC, Madam Jess Turner.\", 'Jess Turner', \"Sure. So the foundation of SRC, which is an EMVCo standard is, in fact, about distributing through partners. And it's -- the success of it is about the whole ecosystem coming together. It's really not different than what we've been doing in the physical world today. So the reason it will distribute quickly is because we're working with payment service providers and acquirers to distribute it, like we do today with physical terminals, but just in the digital world.\", 'We’re also working on migrating acceptance we have now to the secure remote commerce experience. So this ALV [ph] and different pace that we’ve seen before, but I think we need to think about it, like we have operated in the physical world for many, many years. Its about having one way to pay digitally, as you have one terminal in the physical world.', 'Michael Miebach', 'And on prepaid to add, it is still a relatively concentrated geographical distribution but we’re expanding market after market as we’re pushing this product around the world, that would be one thing to say.', 'The second is when I think about segments, there is a good chunk that is in government related financials subsidiary type of payments and is a significant chunk that is in general prepaid reloadable for multi purpose, you see this in markets like Italy and so forth.', 'So its quite a mix. There is not a particular concentration, but think about this is also a business that is growing very fast from a relatively smaller base compared to what as you were referring to as our historic focus on credit for example and debit. But we see as I told you before, we see this doubling and continuing at a same place, at the same spaces in the next 5 years.', 'Warren Kneeshaw', 'Sanjay?', 'Sanjay Sakhrani', \"Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. I guess there's been a lot of chatter about global economic slowdown, economic downturn. I guess, Sachin and you mentioned the business has been crafted to sort of be more defensive. But maybe you can elaborate, sort of what you're seeing, obviously the volume numbers don't suggest there is a lot of weakness, but how you guys are thinking about it, if we were to go into something like that?\", \"And specifically I want to drill down on the Data & Services business, which is growing quite dramatically. How will that behave in a downturn because we've seen how the payments business does?\", 'Sachin Mehra', \"Yeah. So like I said earlier from a consumer spending standpoint we see - we still see pretty solid spending taking place on the consumer side. It's with some level of moderation relative to last year. But that's very much in line with what we expected. You know, the trade uncertainties which we're seeing take place, whether it's the U.S., China stuff or other parts of the globe that is bearing a little bit on business sentiment, that hasn't quite you know, translated over on the consumer side as far as we're seeing right now.\", \"To your specific question around how we would address different macroeconomic environments and how diversification of our business has gotten us to a place which allows us to be more resilient. Here's what I would say, first from a planning standpoint, we will - we always spend a lot of time thinking about how we would react in a mild downturn scenario and in a more severe downturn scenario.\", \"And we've got our contingency plans in place not only in theory, I would tell you from a business owner standpoint everybody's kind of identified what would be the action steps they would be taking in order to make sure that we are being prudent as it relates to how we're managing our expense side of the equation, they still provide good financial returns, but not in any way really impinge on the long-term growth prospects of this company, super important for us to actually remain focused on that.\", \"Again depending on the severity of cycle, you'll pull different levers. Specifically as it relates to services, I think it's a little bit of a mix bag as it relates to how an economic environment might translate for different service capabilities.\", \"So I'll give an example. If you take something like our safety and security capabilities, which are – or take contactless for example, with low value payments coming into play, what we observed in prior economic downturns is while the total volume as in the dollar value of spend which is taking place on cards might decline the number of transactions will actually - or has shown a propensity to increase.\", \"And the reason is consumer behavior is such that if they're going to go to a gas station they're not going to fill up the tank once, they're going to go and put in $20, another $20 so on and so forth. So you see there are puts and takes as it relates to how that might play out and that translates on the services side as well because our services capabilities for example safety and security in some instances is embedded in the network. And it's a function of the number of transactions which go across the network.\", 'So if you think about our revenue model more holistically, the fact that we have a combination of a per transaction fee and an annual [ph] fee in of itself helps us get a certain level of installation as it relates to different economic environments.', 'Ajay Banga', \"And on the big picture Sanjay if you start from where our revenue comes, today from credit, debit and prepaid processing related fees you're probably just a little over a half of our revenue. Some number a little bit north of half, the rest comprises commercial, ACH and real time payments and all these services and that's what I meant about building multiple legs to our revenue stool.\", \"And we have done it very systematically and we had a lot of luck along the way, luck is about 50% of success. I think luck's come our way and – but we have done this with an idea that if you go through a situation where consumer spending gets compressed, one do different features of our revenue model help us through it, and consumer behavior, but two, are there other levers that you could press harder on in an effort to keep the company headed in the right direction even before all the good things we will do with expenses in that situation. So all that expenses are relatively flexible, some of them are not, but flexible has enough flexibility to play some game in that as well, that's the idea.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', \"Great. I think we have time for one last question I'm sorry, James I'll ask you at the back.\", 'James Foster', \"Great. Thank you very much James Foster from Morgan Stanley. I'll go back to kind of where we started with Lisa's question. Ajay, when you look at the services and applications you'd like to layer on top of infrastructures that are being put in place around the world. I guess, do you anticipate the same kind of political environment and questions around those services applications and in similar types of evaluation periods et cetera?\", \"And then I can also appreciate your comment that it's hard to tell whether those services and applications will represent a greater or better or worse revenue opportunity versus running the infrastructure itself.\", \"But what are the things that you're looking for and in what timeframe are you looking to be able to address that question, can services and applications represent a bigger opportunity? Thank you.\", 'Ajay Banga', \"So the effort on services and applications is begun right from the day the Vocalink acquisition happened. For example, the anti money laundering tools what's called Money Murillo [ph] actually developed between Kevin Stanton's team and Paul Stoddart old job when he was still the CEO of Vocalink link and they started rolling that out, what is it Kevin work, a few months after the deal and it's to me that we have seen a number of markets where we don't run the infrastructure that actually interested in that tool because they could run it at a central bank level across all their banks and essentially trying to find money launderers or multiple - you know sort of cycling through 12 account movements to hide movement.\", \"So take in Australia for example where there we don't run the infrastructure there, but there is real interest in having such a service applied for them. So I can see that one having very little political ramifications. It's more a question of does the central bank in that country feel like this is important enough. Do they understand how to use it? How do they apply it? Is there a central bank that can do it or is that a bank owned clearing house that has a better repository of that tool? How do you navigate through those two? How do you create a revenue model because the central bank would love us to give everything away free, blah, blah, right? That's the idea there.\", \"On the application side, the pay my bank account one is the one I'm most interested in today just because I feel that that's something we should see if we can make a difference too in certain kinds of markets, in a market like the UK where we have got a position in debit where our opposition and debit is with challenger banks, but some of the older larger banks are mostly visa concentrated, I would love to be [Audio Gap] their debit is already a regulated interchange market and [Audio Gap] if consumers choose to pay with a bank account as compared to a debit card. So there is a role to be [Audio Gap] and I don't know how to answer the question for you any better. I'm not baking in expectations into my revenue growth that I've told you for this 3 year period that’s [Audio Gap] in the 50% or luck that comes our way, if you don't, well then it'll take longer than two or three years. My going in assumption is this is a 4, 5, 6 year play [Audio Gap] it's not a 1, 2 year play and I might be wrong.\", 'Warren Kneeshaw', \"All right well thank you everyone. We appreciate you coming.

The past few months have been an exciting time for us. As we announced on June 26, Investcorp entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the majority ownership interest in the advisor. On August 30, the last of the steps associated with that purchase was completed. More comprehensive detail is provided in our press release which can be found on our website, and will be further elaborated in our 10-K which will be released at the end of the week.', \"To summarize, Investcorp acquired Stifel and Cyrus's interest in the advisor. The composition of our board will change somewhat on September 15, and we have changed the name and ticker of our fund from CM Finance, Inc. (CMFN) to Investcorp Credit Management BDC (ICMV). Chris, Rocco and I along with the entire investment team will continue in our roles and are truly excited to join the Investcorp platform. We see enormous opportunities ahead for the BDC. The format of this call will follow what we have customarily done; a comment on the quarter and our outlook. Chris will detail portfolio activity during and after the quarter. Rocco will review our financial results and then I'll conclude with additional commentary on handful of specific portfolio positions before we take Q&A.\", \"We continue to reposition and diversify our portfolio with investments in new industries and to new portfolio of companies. We have been conservative focusing on first in loans, and our portfolio is approximately 80% first lien today. We have experienced some challenges in the portfolio but I'm proud of the work the team has done managing existing investments, originating new opportunities and continuing to reposition us through a focus on direct and club relationships. New deal economics are in our view, more borrower and sponsor friendly than we think is ideal but we have seen name-specific opportunities to find tighter, non-economic terms, especially when considering leverage levels, maintenance confidence, restricted payments and other elements which add risk from a lenders perspective. As always, the direct lending in club loan space tends to be slower moving, less certain, but ultimately a source of better structured loans for us to evaluate and invest in.\", \"This quarter we made investments in DIP loans, secondary market purchases of loans and bonds, a syndicated loan, and in a number of club deals. We leveraged our relationships to find and make some of the most attractive loans this quarter and club deals for Limbach and Potpourri. Chris will walk through all of our investment activity during and after the quarter in detail, and then Rocco will discuss our financial results. I'll conclude with some commentary about our largest marks, a few particularly topical investments, and then I'll talk about our outlook over the balance for the calendar year. As always, we'll end with Q&A.\", \"With that, I'll turn it over to Chris.\", 'Christopher Jansen', 'Thanks Mike. We had another active quarter investing in six portfolio companies, including three new portfolio companies. We invested $32.2 million this quarter, all of which was in first lien and debt loans. We also had two full realizations during the quarter.', \"First, I'd like to cover our fundings on revolving and delayed draw positions. We funded approximately $200,000 on 1888 industrial services revolver. We have no delayed draw commitments outstanding currently. As we disclosed on our last call, we made a new investment in the first lien loan of Limbach Holdings. A contractor focused on HVAC, plumbing, electrical and mechanical services for commercial construction. Our yield at cost on Limbach was 10.8%. We participated in the new first lien loans for flow control, a manufacturer of pumps and valves for the power, industrial and energy markets, first reserved as a sponsor. Our yield at cost is approximately 9%.\", \"We're also part of the first lien club transaction for Potpourri Group, most lien capital is the sponsor. Potpourri is a large multi-channel direct-to-consumer marketer targeting middle income women aged 45 and over, and is focused on clothing, accessories, home goods and specialty products. Our yield at cost was approximately 11.6%. We joined with other existing Fusion lenders to first provide a super senior first lien facility which is enrolled into a DIP loan as the company filed for bankruptcy in June. These loans provided need of [ph] liquidity as Fusion began it's reorganization process. The yield is not a particularly meaningful number as the bankruptcy is set to last about four months but we calculated approximately 30% to 60% depending on the specific funding date. We also provided a small incremental loan for 1888 industrial services on a first lien basis as the company made a small strategic acquisition. This loan supports our broader investment in the turnaround of the company which has been making good progress since the oil crisis. Our yield on this new loan at cost is 7.3%.\", \"We're active in managing our positions and excel during the quarter. Earlier in the quarter when sentiment was very positive and yields tightened, we sold out our position in the first lien 10% notes at a price above par and purchased a small additional position in the first lien loan. In May, we added back a small position in the bonds. Our yield on the incremental loan position was approximately 9% at cost, and the new bond position yield's approximately 13.1% at cost. We reduced our net exposure to a seller by net $4 million, as well as lowering our average cost.\", 'We had two small realizations during the June quarter. First, we sold our position in Nexeo Plastics secured bond. Revaluated our ability to build a more meaningful size and attractive price and decided the market was more conducive to selling. I fully realized IRR under small position was 17% which is elevated due to the short holding period. Secondly, we saw those co-invest position in the Zinc Acquisition Holdings. Our loan had already been repaid and we were very pleased with our 80.5% IRR on our two-year long equity investment. When considered together, we realized a 23.1% IRR on our debt and equity investment in Zinc. Since quarter-end, we have made three new investments and had two full realizations. First, we invested in an incremental first lien loan to United Road Services, the leading auto transportation service company in the U.S. United Road is sponsored by [indiscernible]. Our yield at cost is approximately 8.6%.', \"We also participated in the first lien club loan for hyperion materials and technology. Hyperion is an industrial manufactured products made from hard and very hard materials; carbide and synthetic diamonds. It was carved out of Sandvik by KKR. Our yield at cost is approximately 8.3%. Finally, we're also participants in a first lien club loan to NorthStar Group Services, environmental and facility management company focused on the remediation and deconstruction services markets. NorthStar is owned by J.F. Lehman. Our yielded cost is approximately 7.8%.\", \"We had three-fold realizations after quarter-end as well. First, we sold our final debt exposure to PR Wireless, also known as Open Mobile. We previously sold [indiscernible] holding only a delayed drug commitment which fully funded last quarter. Today we have no exposure to Open Mobile from an NAV perspective, although we do continue to carry one at zero value. Our fully realized IRR on Open Mobile's loans was approximately 10.8%. We also sold our first lien position in fleet pride [ph]; this is our third iteration of the investment and candidly, we view it as a high quality but ultimately non-core position. Our fully realized IRR in this position was approximately 6.5% and our IRR across all investments in fleet pride [ph] was approximately 14%. We sold our first lien position in Sears, this is a small position; we never had the ability to build it to a more meaningful size. Our fully realized IRR on the small position was approximately 11.3%.\", 'Using the GICS standard as of June 30, our largest industry concentration was professional services at 13.5% followed by energy equipment and services at 10.2%, media at 9.9%, construction and engineering at 9.8%, and commercial services and supplies at 8.6%. Our portfolio companies are in 21 GICS industries versus 14 industries last year. As of June 30, our portfolio company count was 33 versus 32 at March 31 and 25 companies a year ago, this count stands at 34 today.', \"I'd now like to turn the call over to Rocco to discuss our financial results.\", 'Rocco DelGuercio', 'Thanks, Chris. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, our net investment income was $3 million or $0.22 per share. The fair value of our portfolio was $306.4 million compared to $299.1 million at March 31. Our investment activity accounted for $7.3 million increase in our portfolio, including $8.2 million of net realized and unrealized losses. Our new investments during the quarter had an average yield of 11.5%. The weighted average yield of our debt portfolio was 10.5%, an increase of 6 basis points from March 31. The major drivers of this decrease were our new investments which had a slightly higher yield than our portfolio on an average, and the decline in LIBOR which accounted for a negative 25 basis point impact.', 'As of June 30, our portfolio consisted of 33 portfolio companies. 77.6% were first lien investments, a slight increase from last quarter, driven by our continuing -- continued focus on first lien investments in this quarter. As of June 30, 18.7% of our portfolio is in second lien investments, 3.7% is in unitranche investments, and 0% of our investments are in equity warrants or other positions. 96.8% of our debt portfolio was invested in floating rate loans and 3.2% in fixed rate positions. Our average portfolio company investment was approximately $9.3 million, and our largest portfolio company investment was PGI at $17.3 million. We were 1.16 times levered as of June 30 versus 0.91 times levered as of March 31.', 'Finally, with respect to our liquidity, as of June 30, we had $19.7 million in cash, $6.6 million in restricted cash, and $19 million of capacity under our revolving credit facility with UBS. Additional information regarding the composition of our portfolio will be included in our Form 10-K which will be filed on Friday, September 13.', \"With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike.\", 'Michael Mauer', 'Thank you, Rocco. As we all know, there is a trade-off between risk and returns. We and our peers in the BDC space target returns materially higher than that of investment grade bonds, probably syndicated loans, or even high yield markets. We try to mitigate the risk with diversification in the portfolio across sectors, geographies and borrowers. We focused on the quality of loan documentation, maturities, cash flows and returning principle. We have managed down the portion of the portfolio in second lien investments from 48% in 2016 to less than 20% today and we do not see reasons to reach down the capital structure now to generate e-yield in the current environment.', \"We also have an investment team with deep investment background in distress market which is a valuable resource when any of our borrowers has performance issues. Fusion Connect out for bankruptcy on June 3 due to a combination of factors, especially failure to manage cost and integrate the acquisitions. Fusion ran out of liquidity in April and defaulted on it's interest and principal payments due to lenders, since that time we have been in active discussions with other lenders, council, and advisors to ensure the greatest extent possible we can our ability to participate [indiscernible] and strategically and economically advantageous transactions with the company. Fusion currently expects to exit bankruptcy in October.\", \"During May, 4L unexpectedly announced that both of it's major segments have lost major customers. Management's previously announced guidance was lowered meaningfully and the company hired advisors. Lenders have now formed an adhoc committee, we're working with counsel and advisors to work towards a reorganization of the business. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the situation as the loan is still transitioning from the largely CLO-based ownership group. Business plans are being developed and capital structure discussions are ongoing.\", \"As Chris explained, we actively manage our position to XL Technologies through the quarter. Since our trades, the market consensus appears to be that XL's operational restructuring charges are actually permanent in nature which if true it would reduce EBITDA and at current run rate level these charges put the company under liquidity pressure. The markets negative sentiment is most apparent in the trading levels of the high yield bonds with the loans trading down in sympathy. Our view is that the market is overly pessimistic. The company has multiple levers to manage liquidity and we expect the current sentiment to shift over the coming quarters. We markdown our position in the first and second lien loans in premier global services by an aggregate of $1.2 million this quarter. Trends in PGI's fundamental results continue to be challenging.\", \"That said, the sponsors, Sears Capital, continues to be supportive and behave in a manner that gives us confidence in the business over the longer term, and we maintain an open dialogue with the sponsor, our fellow lenders and industry professionals. We're optimistic in the company's ability to continue to execute a turnaround and we see real upside potential with PGI's transition to it's new business model is reasonably in line with management's plans.\", \"AR or 1888 has been a constant focus for us since 2014. We supported the company through an out-of-court restructuring and currently provide a revolver for working capital purposes as well as multiple trenches of term debt. 1888 made an acquisition this quarter and is poised to grow outside it's historic exclusive focus on the DJ Basin diversifying into the Permian and Wyoming. We provided an incremental term loan to help support this acquisition. We've remained cautious as revenues are still highly concentrated. We have hired a new CEO in conjunction with the acquisition, and we are in the process of hiring a new CFO.\", \"Deluxe Canada continues to perform well and it's independent results are well within our expectations. That said, the U.S. parent company, Deluxe Entertainment Services has entered into an RSA with it's lenders and is targeting to reorganize their capital structure in the coming weeks due to difficulties in it's other business segments. We are in active dialogue with lenders to the U.S. parent, to advisors and counsel, and most especially, with our fellow club lenders to Deluxe Canada. We expect that there may be some business disruption associated with this but our loan was well underwritten and the RSA contemplates no impairment for our class.\", \"Despite the negative creditor events for several of our borrowers this quarter, we continue to make progress with our portfolio repositioning. We've increased our portfolio company count from the mid-20's to the mid-30's today and are gradually increasing the number of club deals in the portfolio. We've used opportunistic sales to help reposition the portfolio and fund the purchase of new loans. In addition, we have several investments that are either committed or in the pipeline that we expect to fund in the near-term. Last quarter I guided that our new leverage target would be in the 1X in a quarter to 1.5X context. We were at 1.16X as of June 30 moving towards our target range. As I previously stated, the advisor will wave base management fees in excess of the excess over 1% for next quarter on leverage of 1X -- above 1X. We did not cover our June quarterly dividend with NII and did not earn our incentive fee. We waived the portion of our management fees associated with base management fees over 1X leverage.\", \"We do expect to cover the dividend and earn our incentive fee in the September quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a distribution for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 of $0.25 per share payable on October 16, 2019 to shareholders of record as of September 26. We have maintained our dividend at $0.25 since March of 2017 and are confident that this level is supported by our ability to generate NII without reducing the quality of our investments or changing our focus from secured lending opportunities. Due to the negotiation of the transaction between CM Investment Partners and Investcorp, we have been in an extended blackout period and as such we're unable to purchase any additional shares. As a reminder, the board approved the extension of this $5 million program through May 1, 2020.\", \"I would also like to update you on Investcorp's commitment to purchase shares of ICMB. There are two components of their commitment. First, there is the commitment to make open market purchases under a 10B5 program. And secondly, to purchase shares at NAV. Investcorp has told us that they expect to execute purchases under both components commencing within the next 90 days.\", \"Lastly, I want to finish by emphasizing that while two quarters ago we started to reposition the portfolio and further diversify it, we've only begun to make progress. As part of a larger platform with Investcorp, a firm which has over $32 billion of run rate AUM, the credit being over $12 billion of that amount, we have enhanced sourcing opportunities and additional resources to leverage as we execute this repositioning.\", 'Operator, please open the line for Q&A.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Nolan. Please state your question.', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Hi, the dividend. Given your high leverage ratios due to migration of the first lien loans, how do you anticipate recovering the dividend going forward?', 'Michael Mauer', \"As we look at the portfolio as it's currently constructed and our target between 1X in a quarter and 1.5X, we will cover the dividends.\", 'Christopher Nolan', 'And then, was the higher yield on new investments this quarter basically skewed by the DIP loan?', 'Michael Mauer', 'No, it was not. If you look at the additions or probably about 10 additions, and they were principally between 8% to 12% yield; so it was well dispersed at no high concentration. The DIP loan is a very, very small investment; so does not disproportionately affect things.', 'Christopher Nolan', \"Great. And final question would be; Mike, your comments on waiving the management fees above one-to-one debt-to-equity, is that waiving all base management fees above one-to-one? It wasn't clear to me.\", 'Michael Mauer', \"I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question was asked. Any base management fee above 1%, not a 100% of base management fee is the above 1% will be waived above one turn of leverage.\", 'Christopher Nolan', \"Got you. Okay, so that's it for me. Thank you.\", 'Michael Mauer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Paul Johnson. Please state your question.', 'Paul Johnson', \"Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. So I'm going to start, we're not aware of Investcorp's presence in the U.S. middle market. And I know -- I think you mentioned that they managed $12 billion or so in credit assets. Are any of those middle market assets? And if so, or if not, I'd take a little bit to what Investcorp brings to enable in terms of value?\", 'Michael Mauer', \"So, couple of things. One is, in credit, none of those are middle market, that was the strategic rationale for us becoming part of Investcorp's platform. Investcorp, it was been around since 1982 and it is by definition, approximately 37 years in the middle market private equity. So they are very, very prevalent in the middle market and prevalent in the U.S. middle market equity side. It brings to the table a platform that it has $32 billion overall, it's got of the $12 billion a little less than half of that is in broadly syndicated credit in the U.S. which has dialogued across the street with regional and large banks. It also brings to the table a lot of middle market lenders who were trying to underwrite to the parent private equity side and bring dialogue. So over the last month, there has been several times that I've gotten calls from people who are looking for dialogue with Investcorp, who are very active in middle market lending, some of which we know very well but it has really ramped up the dialogue and others that we did not as well who have reached out and want to have a dialogue where before they did not.\", 'Paul Johnson', 'Thanks. And then, so as far as -- so I believe the transaction closed on October 30. So are you guys starting to see yield flow right away? I mean has that already changed or do you think it will take more time to improve the ingredients [ph]?', 'Michael Mauer', \"Well, I think EMLA [ph] is just having the word starting, the answer is yes. There is two deals in the last two weeks that have come in, one of which was not interesting to us that we've already passed on, the other which is interesting and we're digging into. So, it had started but I think it is nowhere near what I would say is a ramped up stage as a result of the relationship. I think that will take several months, and more importantly, we are looking at ways to broaden the platform from AUM whether or not those are private funds alongside or other ways to do that. And having more capital will also facilitate ramping up those discussions.\", 'Paul Johnson', 'Thank you for that. And then, as far as their equity Fusion at NAV, basically 5% of the equity based plan to inject into the BDC. Just to be clear, did you say that they expect to execute that within the next 90 days or is that something that will take place over the next two years?', 'Michael Mauer', 'We are in discussions with them about how it will happen but it will begin within the next 90 days is what they have told us they expect. Both the [indiscernible] Paul, in the open market.', 'Paul Johnson', 'Got it. And then, just one or two more, if I may; I was hoping you could provide any short color update on your investment in PGI from your global systems since that was going to larger investments, the stressed mark [ph] last quarter?', 'Michael Mauer', \"Listen, as you know, we operate under NDA so it's hard to say much there. What I would say is that Cereus [ph], the sponsor, continues to be very active, very focused on it, it's one of their largest equity investments and we continue to feel positive about the way they are managing that investment.\", 'Paul Johnson', 'Thanks for that. And then my last question; as far as your outlook for the dividend -- I know you said you expect to earn that along with your full incentive fee, you will be earning an incentive fee next quarter. Does your outlook announced include any sort of credit losses baked into those assumptions?', 'Michael Mauer', \"So, what it -- what we've done is we continue to look at our portfolio, we run models against it without going into any details. We think that that will cover the dividend, we'll earn out base management fee but if or how much of the incentive fee is probably the question there. But we're very happy over the near to medium term to be covering the dividend, and then we'll figure out how we earned in the incentive fee. But the objective here is that, the portfolio that earns the dividend and we have and we moved towards the repositioning of the portfolio more diverse as we continue over the next 6 months.\", 'Paul Johnson', 'Okay, thanks for taking all of my questions this morning.', 'Michael Mauer', 'Thank you very much, Paul.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Robert Dodd. Please state your question.', 'Robert Dodd', \"Hi guys, I'm out of the office, I'm at airport, so excuse me, if there is background noise. On the -- going back to closest unforced question, on the dividend -- I mean, obviously if we look at accruing portfolio at principle was up sequentially. Dividend here was stable, yet total investment income and NII obviously were down materially, sequentially and didn't cover the different this quarter. So could you give us some -- kind of more exclusive color than your confidence level about why there was a decline that quarter with the portfolio growing and stable, and why you expect that trend to levers through the dramatic next quarter?\", 'Michael Mauer', \"I'd say there are two pieces to that Robert and thank you for the question because it requires a little bit of explanation. Number one is, we have increased a little bit under our leverage from prior quarter; so we're at -- I believe it was 1.16, I don't have it right in front of me. As of the end of the quarter we're targeting to get into that 1X in a quarter to 1.5X range which I think we will be barring some unexpected repayments or something like that which is not necessarily be a bad thing but that would affect the leverage ratio. The second piece is that we had unsettled trades going into quarter-end where we had made investments, we were poised to start earning the interest, they delayed on the settling of those. And thirdly, it was the cash balances that we deployed during the quarter, so when we look at going into September we should cover it and then going into the December quarter we should be in better shape as far as the fully deployed.\", 'Robert Dodd', 'Got it, thank you. And as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you started rotating the portfolio -- reposition the portfolio about three quarters ago. Obviously, since then there has been a fairly steady downward trend in NAV with the mark coming through. So is there anything to read into the portfolio repositioning, the attrition of NAV and as you continue to finalize that portfolio repositioning. Are we going to continue to see this slow kind of attrition of NAV until some of those legacy assets get washed out?', 'Michael Mauer', \"Well, I mean, if we felt it the fair value was down, we would have marked it down as of the quarter-end. So I don't know that we will or won't, we do have some positions and we talked about 4L and we talked about Fusion; I think over the next 69 days both of those should have a lot more clarity on the restructuring and where they are coming out. I think also XL had indicated publicly that they expected to work through their restructuring charges through the end of the year, that obviously has a delay in the timetable on which we see it but if they do what they said they are going to do, they are present upside from where it is right now. So there is offset and uncertainty is still there, so unfortunately I don't have a very succinct answer for you, Robert. Hopefully, I…\", 'Robert Dodd', \"That is helpful, and that's kind of -- where the question comes from. You commented on like 4L while it's still rotating from the CLO-type ownership group to maybe something that might be more distress oriented or not CLO-eligible? I mean, doesn't that kind of activity tends to put pressure on the fair values in the near-term, maybe not permanently, right, just trading values now. I mean, so is that a risk there?\", 'Michael Mauer', \"Absolutely. I would say that your observation is correct, that actually taken one step further. When you have any large group that's transitioning, you have pressure on values because that's technical, not fundamental; those are the people who wanted to sell and not hold. On the other side, the people who were buying tend to be people who see value and they are not seeing value whether buying, if they are seeing value significantly above where they are buying because they tend to be hedged funds or distress, and if they are seeing it at the purchase price they never buy.\", 'Robert Dodd', \"Got it, yes, understood. And if I share one more, obviously, we don't have the portfolio, this is what other than [indiscernible] know that I've discussed with you guys in the past because it used to be a big position. I don't know how big is this today but monitoring any update on those guys? I think at one point it was your number one position but obviously it hasn't been for a while now but anything going on there?\", 'Michael Mauer', \"Yes, we revised the public dataset that -- it is from a volatility and went down a bit over the last 6 to 9 months. Over the last months to two months we've seen some positive news, and it's playing out the way we would have expected it too long-term, it would be what I'd say. The other thing is, you can go on publicly and look at the New York State Gaming Commission numbers of revenue by week; they were very, very weak when they opened 18 months ago. As of this spring, they had opened or it was open nearby the waterpark and some other things, they still do not have opened all of the -- I think it's the village but definitely the golf course and some other things. So you can see that they are top -- I want to say their Top 10 weeks of revenue have been in the last 15 weeks, that could be off a little there but you can go and look at that and it continues to ramp up. I don't think it will be significant as a standalone but hopefully, it will help the overall business. The sport book became legal as of September 1, there is only two weeks in as of today as far as revenue on that separately identified piece [ph], and neither one of those has four weeks of college football and NFL in it. And it tends to be [indiscernible] our view is NFL and college football, NCAA basketball there probably the biggest drivers around that but it will help drive some incremental traffic too.\", 'Robert Dodd', 'And on top of that…', 'Christopher Jansen', \"It's Chris. The parent has continued to be supportive in their public documents as -- it's a public filer and there is a commitment to continue to fund from the parent owner; but continue to fund just in case the funds are needed.\", 'Robert Dodd', 'Got it. I appreciate the color guys, thank you.', 'Michael Mauer', 'Okay, are there others?', 'Operator', 'Yes. We have another question from Christopher Nolan. Please go ahead.', 'Christopher Nolan', \"Hi, the look back. I see with the new management that there is a 11 quarter look back and that's a change from just a calendar quarter look back. Is that correct way of looking at it?\", 'Christopher Jansen', \"No, it's the same thing Chris, it's 11 quarters including the current quarter. It's just -- it was just reset.\", 'Michael Mauer', \"So it's a rolling 12, it doesn't -- it's not a calendar, it's always 12 back.\", 'Christopher Nolan', \"Right. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you.\", 'Operator', '[Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no questions.', 'Michael Mauer', 'Thank you very much, operator. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to speaking in several weeks.', 'Operator', \"This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.\"], ['AT&T Inc.

So, thank you very much for joining us again John.\", 'John Stephens', 'Thanks for having us here.', 'David Barden', \"I appreciate it. Could you talk about let's see, I work up Monday morning and I didn't have any mail in my mailbox, but I understand AT&T did. And I guess, there was this letter and it basically said look, we think you should look at selling assets. We think you should cut costs, we think you should have a formalized capital allocation policy and we want to make sure you have all the right bodies and all the right seats. So, sounds all right to me, right? What do you think about it?\", 'John Stephens', 'So, Dave, let me start off by saying thanks for having us. Let me point to this Safe Harbor, which says that we are going to talk about items that may happen in the future. There are risks. We cannot give you assurances on what might happen in the future with regard to that, we would ask you to look for more information on our company, on our Web site and in our SEC filings. So, we thank everyone for listening and being here today.', \"In response to, we didn't get a letter from management on Monday. We did receive it. And I'm going to limit my comments to what the statement that we put out that morning and if you happen to see that statement, you'll know it said a few things. One, our Board and our management routinely meet with investors just like today and discuss ideas with them that we will expect and look forward to meeting with Elliott and to discuss their ideas.\", 'In reading the letter, we do point out that any of the things that are focused on other things as others have said, we were already doing, already have underway. I feel strongly about the fact that management and the board feels strongly that our current strategies are the best way to create value for our shareholders and to maximize that value and we will certainly review any recommendations seriously in accordance with, in the context of our strategies.', \"I will also point out that it was interesting to note that the collection of assets that were pointed out, the collection of assets that we have accumulated or were pointed out to be of something that could create significant value. And we certainly believe that the activities we've undergone over the last few years to get here to accumulate those assets, we are excited about.\", \"So, with that being said, pretty limited in saying anything else other than what that statement said and what I've just said, which is completely, I hopefully very much in accordance with that statement.\", 'David Barden', \"Okay. So, I mean completely separate from that topic. Let's talk about asset sales.\", 'John Stephens', 'Sure.', 'David Barden', \"You've kind of had $6 billion to $8 billion goal of asset sales for the year. You've kind of made some headway on that.\", 'John Stephens', 'We should. Yes.', 'David Barden', 'What other assets are in the AT&T portfolio to be monetized right now?', 'John Stephens', \"Yes. We've talked publicly, openly about some towers. We have about 1200, 1500 towers in our U.S. network that we think are ones that are very valuable, particularly in today's market. And that we could have a lot of demand from buyers. So, that's one.\", \"Two, we have about 1500 or so towers in the Mexico market. We're looking at those, trying to evaluate those, come to our own perspectives, but those certainly are. We've got a $500 million worth of the real estate that's -- has a for sale sign, you can go find it. CB Richard Ellis is handling a lot of before [indiscernible] depending upon the state and the location. And we're continuing to look at other administrative and office buildings that we own, company of our size and our history has a lot of that. We've sold over $2.2 billion worth of real estate already, not just Hudson yards, but a whole collection of other transactions.\", \"We're continuing to look at the [RSS] [ph]. We have regional sports networks. Regional sports services garner good value in other transactions. And we have those that we're looking at those. We've talked in the past about CME, European company -- broadcast company that we have a 75% interest in from the Time Warner assets and they are undergoing a strategic review. And so, that's an important asset and we'll look at that. And quite frankly, we'll just continue to look at others.\", \"I will also tell you a little bit different than what, I think most people think of this asset sales is some of the things you saw us do with order media, accounts receivables, securitizations where we generated literally billions of dollars, half of their assets in very economical, very efficient transactions that could be replicated month in and month out. We're doing a lot more of that. There's more of that to do. We have receivables from the tower companies. We have other positions with regard to assets on our balance sheet. They give us a whole host of opportunities, kind of putting it all into one.\", \"Right now we're very confident in our 2.5 net debt to EBITDA, target for the year end, that 2.5 net debt range. As I always say, we're very confident in achieving that to the point that, I'm actually going to be in the mix. The cash cost of equity is different, higher than the cash cost of debt. We're going to meet that 2.5 net debt to EBITDA range, we made that commitment, but feel very confident about it. So, the conversation is there for us and we're going through that evaluation if you will those buybacks are definitely in the mix now.\", 'David Barden', \"And one of the things, one of the marquee things that get thrown around, and I've seen it bandied about in the sell side too, and I know you've addressed it, is this idea that DirecTV is this divestible assets there's a market for it. What's your thinking on that?\", 'John Stephens', \"So there's been some stories out there about the industrial logic about putting a two satellite providers that's been tried from a regulatory perspective. It hasn't been successful and I don't know that there's any change in that regulatory perspective. So, understand the industrial logic. But quite frankly, it's been tried and has been rejected. Additionally, this is unique time in Washington DC. Industry has got a deal going on where uniquely the Washington DC environment has approved it. And, now the state attorney generals are challenging it. So, I would suggest to you, we'd rather focus on the business than focus on, regulatory process and approvals. With that being said, we're going to keep focus on what we've done is gotten our entertainment group to stable EBITDA, in fact, for the first six months it grew at 4%.\", \"So I think the focus on the business is paying off, a lot of hard work, a lot of discipline work, got to make some hard choices, but feel really -- really good about those choices. And what's going on with it.\", 'David Barden', \"So, I just was talking to Ronan Dunne, Verizon about the kind of restructuring of the business that they did and all the new management teams that they have there and their rules. This summer we've had a lot of changes now at AT&T as well. And I think, the biggest change was John Stankey who kind of was really in the full body Warner media mode now being asked to take over the other 80% of the company that John Donovan was in-charge of that.\", 'I guess, could you, is that, is that the end of it? Is this, are we now at steady state AT&T management structure? And if so, what is the industrial logic for kind of putting on John on top of the whole enchilada?', 'John Stephens', \"Yes. So I'd say this, if you think about what we're coming out with end of October at HBO Max and we're bringing together these tremendously strong distribution capabilities not only network distribution with wireless and wireline, but retail distribution with consumer distribution with 170 million direct to consumer relationships. That's strength there. And you think about pulling that in and the data that it provides, the information it provides into a direct to consumer offering with the most premium content out there which is HBO, centered on HBO, centered on this really high quality. It makes sense to have those things together.\", \"And then, when you think about taking that data, that information, that opportunity, and you put it with a great advertising capability and getting the best out of that advertising capability, it makes sense to bring in that advertising. On the other side, quite frankly, as we've seen, we're the largest distributor direct -- the communications company at AT&T are wireless and our video business on the traditional AT&T side is the largest distributor of HBO had between the distribution on our wireless business as well as the distribution on our satellite and our U.S. business. When you think about the ability to have that premium content and maximize its value in that environment, it's really important. Having that all come up to the same management team and same manager to streamline decision-making to if you will, you can get things to move with greater velocity, it makes all the sense of the world. When you think about…\", 'David Barden', \"So, the idea is to have John Stankey at the top and kind of knitting Robert Greenblatt's business into John McElfresh's business and kind of seeing -- making those two things work together?\", 'John Stephens', \"Yes. We want to make -- the theme across the board is going to be committed to working together. But yes, having that ability to get things done, you've got a cool look, a chance background. I mean things that we're doing with regard to direct to consumer, but what we're doing with regard to the tremendous wireless business we have across that whole business. John has IT and technology experience. He had network experience, imagine that. He was at our business, a wireline group and the wholesale side. He has run consumer mobility. He's had experience in strategy. He's had experience, with Warner Media and real knowledge of it. So, he's the guy that's got the background, that capabilities and we know and knows us and he knows all our capabilities.\", \"Like many of us, he's been with us a long time, so he has the ability to move things and to know we are into direct and how to get things done. So, yes, putting that together, it makes all the sense in the world and is the right way to go about moving forward, particularly with our real significant move with HBO Max, which we'll talk about in October.\", 'David Barden', \"Well, let's talk about it now. So, can you maybe just give us a little sneak preview of what it is we're supposed to be hearing because there's a lot of different bars that have been set and there seems to be like maybe on one end there's NBC Universal who is kind of like, I don't know if I really want to give up too much of my revenue and make too big an investment. And then, there's Disney who's, well, we're going to make a huge investment, and we're going to price it at seven bucks and Apple's going to price it at five bucks and Netflix is at 13 bucks and HBO is at 15 Bucks. And people, I guess the question is, what do you want expectations to be going into this day?\", 'John Stephens', \"I will say, first thing to remember is, we also start with something called HBO. And so, we only have a 40-year head start with a quality product that is the premium of premium. So, we feel really good about that. But with regard to the conference itself, I'm going to completely disappoint you in the crowd because I'm not going say anything of significance or of announcing I think. What I would expect you to see is, a little bit of me, a little bit of brand, a little bit of John Stankey, but a lot of the team, that is really the brain trust and the talent and the real capabilities in our media business. We're real proud of them. They're really talented people. I think you'll see them lay out a really effective and thorough and well thought out and quality plan and we'll lay up some financial implications and discussions as you'd expect.\", \"Outside of that folks who really is, they really need to let the team come out and do their job and they're going to do it a lot better than I could. And I'm excited about the day, put a lot of work into it. We take it seriously, but it's going to be focused on HBO Max. We'll have some other AT&T stuff to answer financial silver, but we'll really focus on the quality team, the quality capabilities, what this unique set of assets. As people have pointed out, how much value there is, this unique set of assets provides. And so, we're excited about it.\", 'David Barden', \"All right. I'll ask you a CFO question. So you were, last week you guys went to Europe, raised €3 billion, at a weighted average interest rate of ridiculously low. And, I think that what's happening in the stock market right now, we've got the forward rate curve is pricing in like a 100% chance of three more rate cuts. And you have a large amount of debt outstanding, which may represent, a lot of people look at it as a naturally a liability, but it might represent a big opportunity as well where we are. So, how excited should I be as an equity investor about what the opportunities are that you see for the balance sheet in this rate environment?\", 'John Stephens', \"So, I guess I'd say this way. I hope people are already excited in the sense that I think over the last 12 months, since we closed the Time Warner deal, I should say, so it's been about 14 months. We've taken that [$180 billion] [ph] and did liability management transactions on about 20% of it already over 30 -- really over $35 billion, and gone out and taken advantage of it. And granted the rates today may be lower than they were six months ago. But we've been, that's been a constant theme. That's a constant part of the management process. George Goeke, our Treasurer and his team and his team of advisors do a great job with that. So it's ongoing.\", \"The entry into Europe last week was very successful. I think we just closed the bond deal, today. And it was very successful. We got €3 billion and very attractive prices and are able to retire some higher costs, bank term loans and give ourselves much more flexibility with regard to the debts, were six, 10 and 20 years. We're going to be continuing to do that. We'll do that mindful and with a focus on getting our net debt to EBITDA test in line with our guidance 2.5x range. But I think of this as an ongoing activity, whether it's in U.S. dollars, whether it's in euros, whether it's in other currencies. And you'll continue to see us do that. We'll focus on our call options and what debt we have there. We'll focus on, redemptions -- it'll all be part of the normal process, but we've done about $36 billion worth of these transactions in the last 14 months. So, I want to make sure this has been ongoing for awhile. When I say, I'll tell you, I mean, we really do have a unique set of assets and we really have been committed to the 2.5x range.\", \"And if you look at what's happened to our debt costs over the last eight months, nine months now, 8.5, it's come down -- 10 years come down almost 150 basis points. Some of that is because the treasuries have come down, but our spreads have come in 60, 70 basis points. So much like our stock, our bond holders are winning in the sense that, as you very, very aptly pointed out doing what they said they were going to do part one and part two. And that's what we're doing. And, it's paying off for our shareholders and it's paying off, for our debt capital guys that we're pleased for both of them, that's who we work for, so take a lot of pride in it.\", 'David Barden', 'And just to highlight, I think that that €3 billion you used to prepay term loans and got a 50 or 60 basis point positive spread on that.', 'John Stephens', 'We did.', 'David Barden', \"So, that's the kind of thing I think that people would be excited about…\", 'John Stephens', \"And those things and those opportunities will continue to be taken advantage of as we get in. But, we monitor them on quite frankly, the team, George Goeke's team monitors on a daily basis.\", 'David Barden', \"Okay. The business. Let's talk a little bit about wireless to start.\", 'John Stephens', 'Sure.', 'David Barden', \"So, since early '17, when Sprint, T-Mobile started merger dance and [you and VZ] [ph] went to unlimited, it seems like it's been a pretty calm, competitive environment, least at the high level. I mean, there's a lot of guerrilla fighting for some of the different pockets of customers, but at a national pricing level, things seems to have been very calm. Verizon lowered prices in August, for their higher level tier. How does that affect AT&T?\", 'John Stephens', \"Yes. So I mean, I'll say it this way. Anytime there's a move in the marketplace, we pay attention to it. We evaluate it. We make decisions on going forward. But, I think your earlier description or talking words that you used to talk about, this is pretty normal kind of normal activities, individual announcements or individual steps, may go into a lot of attention, but it's been a pretty reasonable environment.\", \"So for us, that's how we view it and we've focused on being responsible that we focused on being prudent with promotions and so forth. What I tell you -- that's much more important for me on the wireless side is, I first told, we had announced that we were at 65% -- we're at 40% at the beginning of the year. We've committed, publicly stated that will be at 70% by the end of the year and do the math. Hopefully, we can do better than that.\", \"But that capability, FirstNet is providing us and Dave just to know -- just right outside where you had the group meetings here at the hotel, I got 107 meg speeds on my phone with no Wifi and with no additional AT&T hotspots to provide it. That speed, that 108 meg speeds in the center of a hotel is what our FirstNet is doing for our day to day customers. It's not a 5G phone, it's running on our 5G evolution network, but it's available to anybody who's got phones. That's what's exciting about wireless business. The capacity increase, the fact that we're taking our spectral units up to 150 meg or more 50% increase over the last few years.\", \"All the carrier ag and all the other, [indiscernible] improvements, all the other technology improvements as well as being positioned for the core network to have national coverage of 5G next year. Feel really good about what this bodes for us going forward and the fact that we can compete that we can get, we can build on the 750,000 FirstNet customers that we have that we're going to build on the 9,000, FirstNet authorities, governments and political subdivisions and build on that capability. That our day to day customers going to be happier with us and more satisfied because they are going to see better service.\", \"That's what's really important. So, we feel very good about the business. I will tell you, one thing that's been important and people have been watching and we have seen continued so to speak, slowness and upgrade rates for the first two months of the third quarter for July and August. Upgrade rates in our business were 1.1% each month or 2.2%. That's been our upgrade rate. So, what that means is, if our customers are happy with that service and they're getting those quality and high speeds, that's good. And they're not having to come in and see us or try to make those differences. I say all this because it's important for those who like to think about our business going forward, what equipment revenues might be. As you all know, the change in that equipment revenue is also a similar offset in the change in equipment expense. It doesn't really affect profitability in any significant way. But we are seeing that.\", 'David Barden', \"Is that 2.2% for the first two months of the third quarter. It doesn't surprise me that upgrade rates would be depressed into the expected launch of the iPhone. Is that much more, much lower than you've experienced in prior kind of iPhone launch quarter?\", 'John Stephens', \"Yes. These are -- I think if you would've looked at last years, upgrade rates, they would have been higher for the full year. Any one given month, I don't want to quote on because we haven't given those specific months out. And in year-to-year, the quarter of a iPhone launch depends on whether it's on the 15th day of the month or the 29th day of the month and how much supply and all those kinds of things. But, we are experiencing much lower upgrade rates through the first six months as we've published that we had in the past. And as I'm just saying now through the first two months of the third quarter, that gives us the opportunity to have this high quality network that serves all our customers before they buy the 5G phones while they use the existing phones, gives me optimism about lower churn, about more customer satisfaction, about ability to add services.\", \"Likewise as we go into next year, we turn up all this 5G, if we can get a rock, really great product offering on wireless that involves an HBO Max and quality there and the 5G capabilities to make that product really do well. That's wonderful too. But, we're just really pleased with where we're positioned on the wireless side.\", 'David Barden', \"There's a lot to follow up on there, but I guess question one would be, your reaction to AT&T -- Apple's Day -- announcements yesterday. I think that their announcements on hardware were probably less interesting than their announcements on their content strategy and probably as relevant, if not more relevant for you as a company. How do you -- is there anything that that we would take away as AT&T investors from that Apple announcement yesterday? \", 'John Stephens', \"I would just -- I would go back to [indiscernible]. When you think of HBO and the premium content it has and the history and year in and year out, whether it's, Emmys and awards or whether it's your Game of Thrones or whatever shows you like to watch that, that history of the documentaries, all that, that depth of just HBO alone is tremendous and it's much different than what was talked about by some of the other carriers.\", \"Additionally, when you add to that the Warner Brothers library and the IP and the -- some of the children stuff there, what it might be -- new shows that might come out and other things. I think what you -- I'll leave others to evaluate what you heard yesterday from Apple. But for me it reinforces, boy, we've got really quality assets and really quality capabilities that others just don't have -- don't have at their disposal.\", \"I actually think Warner Brothers studios did a couple of the shows for yesterday's that are listed in yesterday. So, I'm sure those are pretty good shows because the folks over at Warner Brothers do great work.\", 'David Barden', \"Just going back to the wireless network a second, in the November analyst day, last year you kind of hinted that, by the summer you would begin marketing AT&T in a more aggressive way in terms of the best network in the U.S., and you've been winning more awards, coming up the curve. The networks, obviously not upgraded everywhere, but it's moving that direction. Are you seeing signs that -- reality always leads perception?\", \"Are you seeing any evidence or signs of maybe this low upgrade rate is evidence in the churn number? But, you see evidence of that's having an effect on your both, on your gross add funnel and on your churn?\", 'John Stephens', \"So remember, in the first quarter, we had some good solid postpaid voice net adds as well as prepaid. And we did that again in the second quarter. I could point to a lot of things that may be, but I got to believe the network has a big role in it. Secondly, if you looked at sequentially from first quarter to second quarter, you saw churn drop 7 basis points on our smartphone -- on our phone base. That's it. That's a big drop and that's good. We need to continue to do that. So, feel real good about that.\", \"If you look at the GSW, overall network testing, we've won that award two years in a row. That's great. And Ookla, we won the speed test the last two quarters in a row. I know there's people make a lot of claims other than that, but that's really important in the sense of these are two independent agencies consistently saying, what we're doing is working. So we feel, really good about it and the opportunities that that provides.\", \"Yes, we are spending more time and a little bit of money to get the story out to, to have perception catch up with the reality that we do have the best network. So, let's get that perception, some more advertising, some more marketing, smart customer touching, we think that's important, but we think that'll pay off and that may be what's paying off with the seven basis points of lower churn from first to second quarter.\", \"So we'll see. We've got to keep working it, but we are -- you can just tell by the look on my face. I think I'm pretty optimistic. I'm feeling pretty good. The FirstNet operation in total and the network team, what they've been able to do is really remarkable and really efficient and increasing our capacity by 50% over three years is phenomenal. And then, doing it with really high quality and speeds. And I remember we are 5G ready on, we've got 21 markets we do 5G plus today, millimeter wave today, we'll have 29 by the end of the year. We're leading that effort, but we are going to be in a position where we're a nationwide 5G core network provider next -- in the first half of next year. Networks going on to prepare for that. That's going on today. These folks are giving not only 105 meg speeds in the meeting room, in the center of this hotel, but they're getting us ready for 5G for a software upgrade next year to turn it on and line us up. Yes, I'm proud of them. I'm excited for them.\", 'David Barden', \"So, what obviously -- what's made that FirstNet network, the AT&T network improve has been the deployment of the new spectrum basements. You've been pretty active in the millimeter wave auctions. But can you kind of tell us strategically and then reconcile it with kind of your leverage posture? The two next big things coming out, we've got the CBRS auction next year, 2020, kind of what the AT&T posture is on that. And then, we don't really know what's going to happen with C-band, but it seems like the filings that you've made suggests that there's an appetite there, but under certain circumstances, if you could kind of elaborate that and your thoughts?\", 'John Stephens', \"I've got to be real careful. Can't talk about the spectrum auction coming up and don't want to break any of those rules. I'll just say this, with the current position you can tell, we're very pleased with where we're at. We've great capabilities. We've got 600 millimeter -- 650 megahertz on average nationwide millimeter wave, as well as 150 megahertz of sub-6 bands. So, we're -- those are factual positions.\", \"We will continue to look at spectrum and other assets as we go through it. But quite frankly, I would suggest to the investors and the bond holders in the room, I'd suggest to pay to look back to what we did this year and what we said this year is, we were going to net assets of $6 billion to $8 billion of sales. And what that meant was, if we went out and bought something like spectrum, we had to sell something else to pay for it.\", \"That's the real world, what we're doing this year. And I think that's a historical perspective that's very recent, but that's how I would ask you to think about things that will be very focused on paying our own way with regard to whatever we do and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and generating pretty remarkable cash flows.\", 'David Barden', 'I think though that just maybe to follow up on that a little bit is, just -- do you have specific appetite for that mid band spectrum as part of the portfolio, because I think people look at AT&T and say, well, yes, they have got the millimeter wave, they got the sub-six but all that sub-six is sub 2.1. So, is there an appetite or a need for that mid band position and should we anticipate that?', 'John Stephens', \"Yes. Once again, I'm going to be careful about what we say legally on aspects, let me just say right now the spectrum position, one of our nearest competitor has 50% or we have 50% more sub-six spectrum, than they do. And our other competitors would have to do tremendous build requirements to get it -- a lot of the spectrum they made own in the service. We feel really pretty good about our position.\", 'David Barden', \"And I asked this question of others and I keep asking, but I'll continue to ask you, but just, as you were putting your planning horizon together in the last six months of last year, thinking about your three and your five and your 10 year plan, my guess is that that dish being a potential entrant into the mobile market was not on that, in that plan. How do you think about that now? Is it meaningful to your planning horizon or how you think about spectrum and investment and competition?\", 'John Stephens', \"Say, certainly you pay attention to all that and you try to take that into account, into valuation -- a valuation of what you're doing, what your strategies are, as well as both as well as T-Mobile and Sprint getting together or not getting together. You'll want to make sure you are prudent and not -- that you are very prudent about including alternatives. So, we do that.\", \"With regard to, we know how difficult it is to operate a retail organization. We know how hard it is to get scale. We have a history of building a really good networks and we know how hard is to build a consumer based network, an entrant that's coming in without that experience or that base to build off of. And we know how hard it is to build networks that are compatible. They work for 3G as well as 4G, LTE and 5G. And so, we're going to continue to watch and evaluate it. We understand why. I think I understand why they might be involved with that. But, I would tell you, we really do feel pretty good about whatever happens. We're in a really good space to compete because of our spectrum position, because of the network efforts, because of our history with our consumers and our base.\", \"And I say that and on the consumer side, but quite frankly on the business side where we've got nearly 60 million IoT devices or connections out there and great relationships with CIO's and large businesses in serving them in the traditional strategic services or wireline capabilities.\", 'David Barden', \"So, I don't have a ton of time left, but trying to maybe kind of go around the horn a little bit on the other businesses. So let's just jump off with business. I think that, the business side was interesting in the second quarter. Obviously, there was about $100 million one-time, I think IP sale in there. But even netting that out it was maybe down 2%, which was pretty good performance for that group.\", 'John Stephens', \"It's very good. They held on the margins. Relentless cost reduction, activity -- network function virtualization, software defined networks. I applaud the business should have for the efforts they've made and the achievements they've made. These big iron costs continue to come down like they have for years. I continued to work and we grew the strategic service and managed services piece of that business to just under 60%. So, it bodes well for future. We're getting to a point where the legacy services are lower percentage. Feel good where that's going for. We got to keep it going. Market seems to be reasonable.\", 'The big opportunity there though is this additional wireless opportunity, these IoT applications and quite frankly, applications for 5G. So, we feel good about that.', 'David Barden', \"So, Randall, at the second quarter said he's never felt as optimistic about that business unit as he has.\", 'John Stephens', \"So, when you look at the business solutions together, it grew 2.3% with both wired and wireless. So he's got facts to back up what he feels good. And as you see this -- once again this 5G network coming out and this millimeter wave technique there today, the 5G plus today, you get it, in [indiscernible], we got a 2 gig speed on our millimeter wave application. We're getting factories, we're getting venues AT&T stadium in Dallas. We're getting the ability to do these things and that's exciting. And so yes, it is intend to feel good.\", 'David Barden', 'And then shifting to entertainment group.', 'John Stephens', 'So let me say a couple of things on it. Real quickly, first, we had continued to have this really, focus on EBITDA and EBITDA stability. And for the first six months, we were pretty more than successful in achieving that goal in the sense that we grew at 4%. We continued to have that focus. I will tell you as we started into the third quarter, we had a series of content carriage arrangements that were coming due particularly with retrans providers. And so, as we went through those, we had some really -- we had to make some tough decisions on those retrans providers, when some of the requests for increases were just not economically sound. And we decided that we would not accept them and then we had to hold our ground.', \"We took some going dark on a couple of our providers, until rates got to a reasonable level. And then we came back on. In addition, we have gone to our inflow to be reasonable pricing, some promotions, but not extremely promotional. For example, this past August, we took the pricing on our entry related, package one, so to speak, from $35 up to $60 on a full collection of content. You can understand why we do that. Both of those things are going to have an impact on our customer counts in the squatter. We don't know what that incremental pack is going to be, but it could be in the 300,000 to 350,000 range of incremental impact of both those carriage disputes and that change in gross adds coming in.\", \"With all that being said, we've been exceeding our targets on EBITDA and we'll continue to strive to meet or exceed that EBITDA commitment -- the guidance that we gave for the year, feel good about our ability to do that. But wanted you to know that, one other thing, if I could do for the quarter, I just want to kind of point out as we continue to have FX challenges, we have operation Argentina and we have some operations in Latin America. In our case, the FX, exchange rates are usually offset by -- on the revenue side offset by cash operating expenses. So, they really don't necessarily fall to the bottom line in any major way, but it does have an impact on gross revenues, it will have an impact on expenses. It's something that, if you will, finally happens.\", \"But, with all that being said, getting into that $28 billion free cash flow range for the year and getting to the 2.5 range for the year, it feels really, really good. And we feel -- and living up to our commitments on asset sales feels really good. So, we're working really hard and we're going to keep doing it. But, it's consistent with what we've been saying all year. And my goal is to let an analyst come out and say, doing what they said they were going to do, part three.\", 'David Barden', \"All right, John. Thank you very much. That's a great place to leave it. I appreciate your time.\", 'John Stephens', 'Thank you everybody.', 'Question-and-Answer Session', 'Q - David Barden'], ['', '\\n        To ensure this doesn’t happen in the future, please enable Javascript and cookies in your browser.\\n        Is this happening to you frequently?
